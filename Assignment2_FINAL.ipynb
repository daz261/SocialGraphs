The node $i$ is then moved into the neighbouring community which gives the maximum $\\Delta Q$, if a positive one exists. Else it remains in it's current community.

So the IDF will be higher if the the term is rare across the different communities. This means the TF-IDF will be highest when a term is very frequent in a community and shows up in that community only.
