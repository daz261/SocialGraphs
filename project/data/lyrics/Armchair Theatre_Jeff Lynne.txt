[Verse 1]
If your heart could talk
I wonder what it would tell me?
If your mind could walk
Would it bring me a love never ending?
Yes, I've got to know
I've got to know

[Pre-Chorus]
No secrets anymore
You've got to tell me

[Verse 2]
All your days have gone
A-goin' to a go-go
Now the time has come
Is it gonna be a no no, no no no?
I've got to know
I've got to know

[Pre-Chorus]
No secrets anymore
You've got to tell me

[Chorus]
Tell me every little thing
That makes you happy
Oh oh oh, every little thing
That makes you glad
All the secrets that you hide
I've got to know
Whoa, every little thing

[Verse 3]
You gotta stop
All your reservations
Am I for the chop
Or is it celebrations?
Yes, I've got to know
I've got to know

[Pre-Chorus]
No secrets anymore
You've got to tell me

[Chorus]
Tell me every little thing
That makes you happy
Oh oh oh, every little thing
That makes you glad
All the secrets that you hide
I've got to know
Whoa, every little thing

[Bridge]
Tell me every little thing (Tell me)
Every little thing (Tell me)

[Chorus]
Tell me every little thing
That makes you happy
Oh oh oh, every little thing
That makes you glad
The secrets that you hide
I've got to know
Whoa, every little thing

[Outro]
Every little thing
Every little thing

 

[Verse 1]
Love is what I want, oh yeah
And all you gotta do is bring it to me, baby
Talk is what I want, oh yeah
(What I want, what I want)
And all you gotta do is bring it to me, baby

[Pre-Chorus 1]
(Talk) Come on, let's talk about it
(Talk) Can't seem to do without it
(Talk) Don't want to be one of
The broken-hearted

[Chorus]
So lift me up, finish what you started
Take me on for a ride
Lift me up from the broken-hearted
River's deep and wide

[Verse 2]
All I want is love, oh yeah
(What I want, what I want)
And all you gotta do is listen to me, baby
(What I want, what I want)

[Pre-Chorus 2]
(Think) You've got to think about it
(Think) And do something about it
(Think) No use complainin'
When it's over (Over)

[Chorus]
So lift me up, finish what you started
Take me on for a ride
Lift me up from the broken-hearted
River's deep and wide

[Pre-Chorus 3]
'Cause life gets tougher every day
If you can't afford to pay
Even so, you've got to carry on (Carry on)

[Chorus]
So lift me up, finish what you started
Take me on for a ride
Lift me up from the broken-hearted
River's deep and wide

[Chorus]
Lift me up
Take me on for a ride
Lift me up from the broken-hearted
River's deep and wide

[Outro]
(Lift me up)
Oh yeah, now
Lift me up, oh
The river's deep and wide

 

I can tell by the way
There ain't no lights in the windows
And by the way your curtains hang
Yeah, I know which way the wind blows

I said no
I said no
I said no

Ain't nobody home
(Nobody home)
Ain't nobody home
(Nobody home)

You went away with your heavy load
Yeah, you must have took it with you
Down and out, to no thanks to boat
But no one can get ya

I said no
(Nobody)
I said no
(Nobody)
I said no, no

Ain't nobody home
(Nobody home)
Ain't nobody home
(Nobody home)

I said nobody
(No)
Nobody home

Nobody home
Nobody home

From the way that you act
I guess you hardly been there
By the look in your eyes
There's nobody in there

I said no
(Nobody)
I said no
(Nobody)
I said no

Ain't nobody home
Nobody home

I said nobody
(No)
Nobody
Nobody home

Nobody home
Nobody home

I said no
(Nobody)
I said no
(Nobody)
I said no, no, no

Ain't nobody home
(Nobody home)
There's nobody home
(Nobody home)

I said nobody
(No)
Nobody home

Nobody home
Nobody home
Nobody home

Ain't nobody home
(Nobody home)
Nobody home
Nobody home
Nobody home
Nobody home

Nobody home
Nobody home

Ain't nobody, nobody home
Nobody home
Nobody home

 

Oh, it's a long long time
From May to December
And the days grow short
When you reach September

When the autumn weather
Turns the leaves to flame
And you ain't got time
For the waiting game

When days dwindle down to a precious few
September, November
And these few golden days I'd share with you
Those golden days I'd share with you

When the days dwindle down to a precious few
September, November
And all those golden days I'd share with you
Those golden days I'd share with you

Those golden days I'd share with you
Those golden days I'd share with you

 

Remember what you told me
That you would always be there
If you change your mind now

Oh, what would it take to save me?
What would it take to save me now?

Here comes another night
And all the stars are shining
Could I make it right?

Oh, what would it take to save me?
What would it take to save me now?

Woah, what would it take?
Woah, what would it take
To save me?

What would it take to save me?
What would it take to save me now?

Woah, what would it take?
(What would it take to save me now?)
Woah, what would it take
(What would it take to save me now?)
To save me?

Of all the things I do
And everywhere they take me
You know what I go through

Ooh, what would it take to save me?
What would it take to save me now?
What would it take to save me?
What would it take to save me now?

 

Don't know why
There's no sun up in the sky
Stormy weather
Since my girl and I ain't been together
Keeps raining all the time

Life is bare
Gloom and misery everywhere
Stormy weather
Just can't seem to get myself together
I'm weary all the time, oh yeah

Since she went away
The blues walked in and met me
If she stays away
Old rocking chair will get me
All I do is pray
The Lord will let me
Walk in the sun once more

Since she went away
The blues walked in and met me
If she stays away
OId rocking chair will get me
All I do is pray
The Lord will let me
Walk in the sun once more

Can't go on
Everything I had is gone
Stormy weather
Since my gal and I ain't been together
Keeps raining all the time
Keeps raining all the time

Stormy weather
Stormy weather
Stormy weather
Keeps raining all the time
