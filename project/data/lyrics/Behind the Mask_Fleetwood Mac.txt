[Verse]
If I've been acting a little strange
And you have noticed it too
It's because my life has been rearranged
With the presence of you
The sky is the limit now
We can hit it on the nail
And when we do
I'll think about you
How can we fail
Can you give me one reason why
You'd ever let me down
I won't believe it baby, but I'll try
The truth's going to come around
The sky is the limit now
We can hit it on the nail
And when we do
I'll think about you
How can we fail
The sky is the limit
Oh, the sky is the limit
How can we fail
Sooner or later
I'll keep the promise
I made you
Sooner or later
It will be greater
Than we ever knew
The sky is the limit now
We can hit it on the nail
And when we do
I'll think about you
The sky is the limit now
We can hit it on the nail
And when we do
I'll think about you
How can we fail
The sky is the limit
The sky is the limit
Oh, the sky is the limit
How can we fail
The sky is the limit
Oh, the sky is the limit
How can we fail

 

[Verse 1]
Well I try and I try
You can't forget her
Can't run, can't hide
When you remember
Nights that won't fade away
Yea fade away
Well I still go crazy
When you hear her name
Feels like you just left today
And it drives you insane
But you keep holding on
Yea holding on

[Chorus]
In the back of my mind
You live all the time
In the back of my mind
In the back of my mind
Every night, every day
That's where you still play
In the back of my mind

[Verse 2]
When I close my eyes
You can still touch her
And I fantasize
She's still your lover
When I wake up I see
The only place you'll be
I know where you'll be

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I remember your eyes burning bright
Like we touched the summer sun
I can see your shadow standing there
On the streets where we used to run
Remember

[Chorus]
In the back of my mind
You live all the time
In the back of my mind
In the back of my mind
Every night, every day
That's where you still play
In the back of my mind
In the back of my mind
You live all the time
In the back of my mind
In the back of my mind

 

[Verse]
Do you know
All there is to know about love
And if you do
Then let me know
If I have learned enough
To make it without you

[Chorus]
Can I learn
All about love
I don't know enough to make it alone
Well I can leave it just the way it was
I can try
I'm gonna try

[Verse]
And if I fall
If I ever fall in love again
I hope I will feel the same

[Chorus]
Can I learn
All about love
I don't know enough to make it alone
Well I can leave it just the way it was
I can try
I'm gonna try

Do you know
All about love
Do you know enough to make it alone
Can you just leave it the way it was
Can you try

[Solo]

[Chorus]
Can I learn
All about love
I don't know enough to make it alone
Well I can leave it just the way it was
I can try

Well I can leave it just the way it was
Let me try

Well I can leave it just the way it was
Let me try

Well I can leave it the way it was

 

[Verse 1]
With the laughing eyes
You, the one with the haunting stare
Well you
You have the power to hypnotize
I should'a known better
I should beware

[Chorus]
Because I have followed you
Done everything for you
But you just won't look my way
So come on baby and
Save me
I'm running for cover
Save me
Is it one or the other babe
Save me
It's time for somebody else
Save me

[Verse 2]
Well, you, you could own the universe
Think about it and you'll realize
You, you got to believe me
And take my word
Look at me
It's written in my eyes

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
I can't wait any longer
For paradise
I told you once
I'm not going to tell you twice

[Outro]
So come on baby and
Save me
I'm running for cover
Save me
Is it one or the other babe
Save me
I guess it's time for somebody else
Save me
Save me
I'm running for cover
Save me
Is it one or the other
Save me
I guess it's time for somebody else
Save me[x8]

 

[Verse 1]
Push too hard, I'll pack my bags, I'm going
Ahh, got to learn to let the river flow
Move too fast, You'll end up never knowing
What's inside my heart, give it time to grow
I need just a little space
Then I won't be afraid

[Chorus]
When it comes to love, got to treat it special
When it comes to love, shouldn't be no pressure
When it comes to love, got to take it easy
You can't be too careful, when it comes to love

[Verse 2]
In your eyes I see a fire burning
Never seen it ever burn so bright
Beneath my feet I feel the earth start turning
Long enough to take my breath away and I
Need to know, what you feel
Got to show, it's for real

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
When it comes to love
Take It Easy
Got to learn to take it slow
When it comes to love
Keep believing
When it comes to love
Give it time, and just let it grow
I need to know, what you feel
Got to show, it's for real

[Chorus][x3]
