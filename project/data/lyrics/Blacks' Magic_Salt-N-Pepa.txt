The duo is back, competition check out the new style
Then get the heck out
Put on your battlin' gear, but don't come strapped
Bullets are not needed, this time it's rap for rap
I'm makin' the move, and soon you'll have to make yours back
In fact, the further the rhyme is dancin', Jack will get a lip smack
So break up because it's time you shook up, you gotta make up
It's time to break up the party, now you're shook up
Salt and Pepa's gettin' swift, livin' up to par
And competition, how to "Whassup" is to ride the bra strap
Hurby's on the beats, Steevee-O has the musical notes
Spinderella's like a propeller spinnin' music so dope
Makin' a lot of noise for all the boys shootin' the gift
Hold on tight cuz tonight Salt and Pepa's gettin' swift

You might have thought about goin' against the spices
Salt and Pepa's a mixture like Chinese rices
Battlin' time, Mr. Macho, please don't try to rip
Because I'll melt ya like Nacho cheese
You want flavor, well here's something to savor
Why don't you wave a microphone in front of my face
And a do small favor, gimme a beat so I can bust a rhyme
For all the nerds, let all the words feed your mind
Statin' the things and pleasin', takin' a rest, I'm out for easin'
Bodily functions makin' 'em dance and Pep, this is the Christmas season
This is duck season, and I'm gettin' high
You're outta luck, duck, now it's time for you to get and die
The ebony queens are back on the scene
I assume you still suck like a vacuum machine
Cornball sucker, give me a break
I'm-a drop you from the sky like snow, you a cornflake
Born to break any sucker or half-stepper
Who wants to get assaulted with a deadly pepper
Go down, low-down, this ain't no showdown
The competition, I'm sure they'll blow down
Even if you seem to stand stiff
The breeze of the rhyme makes you move, and we get swift

Suckers and flukes, it seems you lost and time to put up dukes
Cuz you just forced it, the furious females too fly to (fuck) with
Stay stiff suckers, soon you'll be stuck with a rep, torn to shreds
A musical score leg, need a victory?  I left an 'S' on your forehead
Don't fuse up now, it's time to put out lights
I won't ease up, pal, cuz I'm-a go outta sight
Lyrical queen, mess around, and you'll get creamed
The star of every male's fantasy or wetdream
The ebony princess in a lyrical safari
Battlin' me is like a Honda racing a Ferrari
If you were the king, what laws would you have me obey?
None, my son, cuz I'm quicker than a Cabriolet
Quick to split the chick tryin' to get slick
You're nothing but a prostitute turning a new trick
Little Miss Wench, my mind is a trench
Makes you drop, then you stop in your tracks and as I clench
My fist, I twist words you use to rip
The next time you flex, I'm guaranteed to get swift

Hip-hopper's, rap artists, and rhyme fanatics
Can you believe there's a sucker trying to cause static?
Break out the health supplies and medical aid
Prepare your mind for a super, alphabetical raid
Rhythmic explosion without corrosion
Rhymes, in effect, that protect like a Trojan
Against disease, sorta like a wack MC
Rhymes more powerful than a punch at Jack Dempsy
I fear no one, plus I tell no tales
I will stand up to any male or female
Ones who persist to resist end up a prisoner
Hissed in a daze or a faze because he is in a
State of shock, too hard for one to take
So in a multitude of crowds I run to break
Beats for torture, but don't get played
I stay paid, I caught ya now you shook, you're afraid
Scared of the fact we came back to uplift
The name, we designed the game, and we get swift

Song:   I Like to Party

Let's kick it like this, ah yeah
We gotta kick it like this, ah yeah
We need to kick it like this, ah yeah
We gonna kick it like this, ah yeah

[And let me tell ya, girl, I'm a party animal, see?
Word, and I need a man that can hang with this thing
You know what I'm sayin'?
Oooo, child, I know what you're sayin'

Hey ladies!  I said homegirls!
We've been goin' for the dog-doo
It's gettin' to be a real drag around here, you know what I'm sayin'?
A woman can't do nothin' no more, man
We've got to let the fellas know what they can do for us]

As the smoke clears you can hear
And the ringing in your ears just disappears
Your body's soft, but you still want more
You might end up as a casualty on the dance floor
I'm an addict, strung out on dopeness
But you can't chew, sniff, or smoke this
If you wanna get high step by the speaker
And overdose on somethin' sweeter
Do you suffer from migranes or other pains
That's caused by stress and strain?  Brother, refrain
You came to the right place to get your head straight
The cure's for sure, the beat's the bait
I won't wait for the crowd to get loud or rowdy
I enjoy my life cuz I like to party

CHORUS
I like to party, night and day
I like to party in every way
I like to party, I can't stop
I like to party till I drop
(Repeat)

We're steppin' on the case, watch your face
Don't like the pace then leave the place
It's Ladies Night, yeah, and we hype
Heels, shirt, tights, and a mic
Like three the hard way we're doin' it our way
Rollin' and gettin' funky like Kid 'N Play
See her over there behind the phonograph
She's a psychopath, I make the breaks last
A Salt and Pepa parade this is
So march on the dance floor with his
Arms wrapped real tight around your body
And you'll understand why

CHORUS

[Make it funky, Pep]

Oh, I feel hot then again why not
This ain't pop, it's hip-hop
And got a lot to rock to, dip and dop to
You don't have to, but you probably want to
It makes you laugh because it's really fun to
Twist your tongue and exercise your lungs to
Tonight on the mic we're showing
We're strong enough for a man, but made for a woman
Hey you!  Where do you think you're goin'?
Yo, Stan, my man, keep the horns blowin'
Havin' a good time ain't no crime
When the joint is jumpin' and people are dancin'
Everyone does it, now it's no sin
Yo, I just did it, and I'm ready to do it again and again and again

CHORUS

[Wait a minute...
Now I think it's time we give the drummer
Some of this funky groove we got here
You ain't got to throw no solo in, brother
Just keep what ya got
Yo, turn it loose cuz it's a mutha

Now when I count to four I want y'all to chill
And let the drummer get ill
And when I count to four I want y'all to come back in once more]

It's in my feet, feels so sweet
Said it's in my feet, feels so sweet
It's in my shake, oooo, but it work me to death
Said it's in my shake, but it work me to death
I want the floor, I wanna rock the floor
C'mon, y'all - 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - hit it!

(drum solo)

[Ain't it good to ya?
Uh, ain't it good to ya?]

Song:   Start the Party

I'm gettin' dressed for the jam about to jump in my Mercedes
Slippin' on my dancin' shoes cuz I'm a lady of the eighties
It's Friday night, I just got paid, my house is pumpin'
Or listenin' to my Hammer tape, while my sound system is dumpin'
Picked up my girl Salty, she was waitin' on the porch
I shared my fly, fly Mercedes, yo, lit the highway like a torch
On the way to pick up Spindy we raced with a 1-9-D
He was a sucker duck if he thought he could buck with us in E
The party started

CHORUS
Let's get this party started
Let's get this party started right

Rolled up at the party, saw a fella black and fine
Bow-legged, high-top fade, then I said, "Yo, that one's mine"
Stepped out of the ride, told the bouncer, "Hold my Benzy"
Heard the bass, it was the place so I slipped my man a penny
When we walked in the jam fans met us at the door
They yelled, "We love you Salt and Pepa!" "Yes, we love y'all even more!"
Some foul, wack, nappy bitty tried to step to Spinderella
I was cool, I made my move, then I droppped her like a fella
Start the party, boy

CHORUS

Now this is what you call a hip-hop beat from S and P
So get out on the dancefloor, and don't even rough with me
I ain't goin' for it, I ain't buyin' it so don't even try me
Dance sucker, Mother Tucker can, that old lady gets busy
Yeah, I don't give a damn, Salty is who I am
And man, I'm gonna slam this jam, you understand?
Yes, we will stay the queens no matter what the means
The party started, let's get retarded, now work them bluejeans
Rock the party, y'all

CHORUS

[Yo, Salt, you wanna continue the story?]
Yes, I told the people move, he made a move
To the stage and grabbed the mic
From these stank, sorry, frauds - Run D.M.C. look-alikes
Spinderella took the set, made her fingers nice and wet
And you bet she made that DJ sweat, and he won't soon forget
Pepa took on the speaker, bust an oh, so funky rhyme
I did a step right on time and made the crowd lose their minds
The whole place was on the floor, we was rockin' hardcore-core
We left them wantin' more, and we headed out the door
We rocked the party

CHORUS
