[Intro]
Yeah...

Wanna give it up
Gotta give it up
Can't give it up

[Verse 1]
Oh, mama, ohm oh
The money's run out
And I'm a hungry man
Oh, mama, ooh
You see
I--I'm a--hurtin' man
I was just a boy
When they told me
"God love ya"
"You're insane"
Here I am
Pistol in my hand
Judge and jury
One the same

[Chorus]
I got trouble with the sweet stuff, oh yeah
I got trouble with the sweet stuff, oh yeah
And I'm never ever gonna shake it
Shake it
Trouble with the sweet stuff
Trouble with the sweet stuff

[Verse 2]
Oooo, bang bang
They shot me down
Caught me
Robbing the bank again
Say I'm crazy
I'm a desperate man
Nah right (c'mon)
Daddy in the junk shop
Alley babe
Tryin' to smoke that stuff
I said
I can't believe it (Ooh give it up)

[Chorus]
Trouble with the sweet stuff, oh yeah
I got trouble with the sweet stuff
And I'm never
Ever gonna shake it
Shake it

[Bridge]
Don't wanna give it up
Don't wanna give it up
Yeah
Shake it
Gotta give it up
Don't wanna give it up
Don't wanna give it up

[Verse 3]
Trouble with the sweet stuff, oh yeah
Mommy's in the graveyard
Pushed her oh so long
Baby ain't cryin'
Cradle's cold, long gone
And me, mama, mama
Yes, when the situation
Breaks down
You've got trouble, trouble
Bang bang
They shot me down
Caught me robbin' d' bank again
(Are you crazy)
Baby, oh yeah
I'm a desperate man
Daddy in the junk shop
Alley babe
Tryin' to smoke that stuff
And me
Never gonna shake it
Baby yeah
(Ooh give it up)

[Chorus]
Trouble with the sweet stuff, oh yeah
I got trouble with the sweet stuff, oh yeah
Trouble with the sweet stuff, baby
And I'm never, never, never, never, ever
Gonna shake it

[Verse 4]
I want
(Don't wanna give it up)
Trouble with the sweet stuff, yeah
Believe me, babe
Shake it
Can't give it up
Come on and shake it
Yeah
Daddy's in the junk shop alley babe
Tryin' to smoke that stuff, oh yeah
Yeah, gonna shake it
Can't give it up
Can't give it up
Do you feel pain
The same way I feel pain, babe
(Give it up)
Breathe the same air
I gotta give it up
Wanna give it up
Can't give it up
Gotta give it up

[Outro]
Give it up
Give it up

 

[Verse 1]
It's Christmas time, and I'm lonely
Here y'know the living ain't easy
If you forget the power to love
I said, "Don't give up"
"Don't give up"

[Chorus]
If only I could see you once again
If only to put my lips against you again
Don't hold back the power to love, oh
Don't hold back the power to love
Don't hold back, yeah, from the pluck of the lyre
In the arms of desire

[Verse 2]
It was dry and a fine day when we first came ashore
I wasn't really sure what I was looking for
Tracks of my mind made the tracks of my arms seemed a lot more of a curse
To make matters worse, I was lonely for you
So lonely for you
Baby, yeah, so lonely

[Chorus]
Oh, if I should see you once again
If only to press my lips to yours, ah
Don't give up the power to love
And don't hold back the power to love
Don't hold back, aw yeah, from the pluck of the lyre
In the arms of desire
And the tracks of my mind seemed more like a curse, baby

[Interlude]
Ow!
Ooh yeah

[Outro]
Right there and then I saw or swore I could see with my own two eyes
Yo' lying eyes, yo' lying eyes
Yes, right there and then
It made the tracks of my mind seem worse
And the tracks on my arms, a lot more of a curse
Oh, lonely for you, baby, yeah
So lonely for you, baby, yeah
So lonely for you, baby, yeah
And the tracks of my mind seemed more like a curse, ow
The tracks of my mind seemed more like a curse, baby
I was lonely for you, baby, yeah
So lonely for you, baby, yeah
So lonely for you, baby, yeah
And the tracks of my mind seemed more like a curse
