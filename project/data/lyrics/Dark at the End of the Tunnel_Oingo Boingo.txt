Everyone says, sooner or later
You'll reach the end of the line
When things get rough
Some think it's easy to jump the ship...
You decide

I say, don't throw it away
There's about a million reasons why
Though you've heard them all before
And you're getting very tired
Lay your head on my lap
And I'll sing you this lullaby:

Don't you know
That everyone around you
Has felt the pain you feel today?
You're out of control, yeah—
And you want someone to tell you
When you wake up in the morning, it'll only be a dream
You're out of control....

There's a cloud rollin' overhead
And it seems to rain on no one else
There's a black sun casting a black shadow
And I know you feel so all alone
You're out of control—and you want the world to love you
Or maybe you just want a chance to let them know
Yeah, that you live and breathe and suffer
And your back is in the corner
And you've got nowhere to go

Nothing for nothing—everything's right at your fingertips—for a price
Who ever said that life on this planet would ever be paradise?
I say, don't throw it away; you've got too many things to say
If you throw away your life—if you throw away your life
If you throw away your life, the world will never be the same

Don't you know
That everyone around you
Has felt the pain you feel today?
You're out of control, yeah—it'll only be a dream

You're out of control—and you move without direction
And people look right through your soul
You're out of control—and you want someone to tell you:
When you wake up in the morning, it'll only be a dream
And I wish that I could tell you it'll only be a dream

 

Water's flowing through my veins
Nothing ever stays the same
Water's flowing down my side
Turn the water into wine

Where's the courage I once had?
Where's the strength I once possessed
To stand up tall and face the music
Laughing in the face of Death

Here's a boy whose hands are bleeding
Though he's never had a scratch
Glory come and glory be
Water's flowing now at last

Like a bad dream I once had where
Everyone but me knew something
Walking blind through burning fields
The dead brigade is on my heels
They follow me—they follow me

Water's flowing through my veins
Nothing ever stays the same
Flows outside for all to see
Water flows through you and me

Like a bad dream I once had where
Everyone but me knew something
Walking blind through burning fields
The dead brigade is on my heels
They follow me—they follow me

Water's flowing through me
Cut me open; let me bleed
Silence is golden
(But) shout it out, now—shout it out—shout

Water's flowing through my veins
Nothing ever stays the same
Through eyes that once were blind
With passion
Everything looks soft and gray
Without color or rough edges
Without fire to burn the skin
Without pride and without reason
Water turn to wine again

Water's flowing through my veins
Tell me now it's all the same
Tell me that it doesn't matter
Tell me everything's all right

Like a bad dream I once had where
Everyone but me knew something
Walking blind through burning fields
The dead brigade is on my heels
They follow me—they follow me

Water's flowing through my veins
Nothing ever stays the same
Glory come and glory be
Glory come to you and me
Water's flowing through my veins....

 

Come to the rescue now
Come to the rescue and stay for a little while
Come to the burning house
All of the ladybug's children are screaming, "Fire"
Come to the rescue now

Life is a dream somehow
Life is a game that is ruled with an iron fist
Life is a broken nose
Life is a sly little smile and a virgin's kiss
Come to the rescue now

Tomorrow may change—tomorrow may change
Or it may never come
Tomorrow may change—tomorrow may change
But it may never come
Turn around—turn around—turn around—what do you see?

Come to the rescue now
Come to rescue before all our worlds collide
Life is a dream somehow
Life is speck of dust lodged in God's eye
Life is a dream somehow

Come to the recue now
Come with a mission and come with a broken heart
Life is a dream somehow
Life is a dream and our lives are a world apart
Come to the rescue now

Tomorrow may change—tomorrow may change
Or it may never come
Tomorrow may change—tomorrow may change
But it may never come
Turn around—turn around—turn around—what do you see?

Come to the rescue

Life is a dream somehow
Life is a nightmare and life is a bitter pill
(Life is a dream somehow)
Life is a Disneyland ride, which is better still
Come to the rescue now

Life is a drowning pool
Life is a circus for fools just like you and me
Life is a mortal coil
Wrapped in cheap tinfoil on a kitchen sink
Come to the rescue now

Tomorrow may change—tomorrow may change
Or it may never come
Tomorrow may change—tomorrow may change
But it may never come
Turn around—turn around—turn around—what do you see?

Dream somehow; come to the rescue now....
