[Verse 1:]
Oh Mom, the dreams are not so bad
It's just that there's so much to do
And I'm tired of sleeping

[Verse 2:]
Oh Mom, the old man is telling me something
His eyes are wide and his mouth is thin
And I just can't hear what he's saying

[Chorus:]
Oh Mom, I wonder when I'll be waking
It's just that there's so much to do
And I'm tired of sleeping

[Verse 3:]
Oh Mom, the kids are playing in pennies
They're up to their knees in money
And the dirt of the churchyard steps

[Verse 4:]
Oh Mom, that man he ripped out his lining
He tore out a piece of his body
To show us his "clean quilted heart"

[Chorus:]
Oh Mom, I wonder when I'll be waking
It's just that there's so much to do
And I'm tired of sleeping

[Verse 5:]
Oh Mom, the bird on the string is hanging
Her bones are twisting and dancing
She's fighting for her small life

[Chorus:]
Oh Mom, I wonder when I'll be waking
It's just that there's so much to do
And I'm tired of sleeping

[Chorus:]
Oh Mom, I wonder when I'll be waking
It's just that there's so much to do
And I'm tired of sleeping

[Chorus:]
Oh Mom, I wonder when I'll be waking
It's just that there's so much to do
And I'm tired of sleeping

 

[Verse 1:]
Men in a war
If they've lost a limb
Still feel that limb
As they did before

[Chorus:]
Men in a war
If they've lost a limb
Still feel that limb
As they did before

[Hook 1:]
He lay on a cot
He was drenched in a sweat
He was mute and staring
But feeling the thing
He had not

[Pre-Chorus:]
I know how it is
When something is gone
A piece of your eyesight
Or maybe your vision
A corner of sense
Goes blank on the screen
A piece of the scan
Gets filled in by hand
You know that it was
And now it is not
So you just make do with
Whatever you've got

[Chorus:]
Men in a war
If they've lost a limb
Still feel that limb
As they did before

[Verse 2:]
If your nerve is cut
If you're kept on the stretch
You don't feel your will
You can't find your gut

[Hook 2:]
And she lay on her back
She made sure she was hid
She was mute and staring
Not feeling the thing
That she did

[Pre-Chorus:]
I know how it is
When something is gone
A piece of your eyesight
Or maybe your vision
A corner of sense
Goes blank on the screen
A piece of the scan
Gets filled in by hand
You know that it was
And now it is not
So you just make do with
Whatever you've got

[Chorus:]
Men in a war
If they've lost a limb
Still feel that limb
As they did before

[Outro:]
Men (men men)
in a war (war war)
If they've lost (lost lost)
a limb (limb limb)
Still feel (feel feel)
that limb (limb limb)
As they did (did did)
before

 

[Lyrics of „Rusted Pipe“]

[Verse 1]
Now the time has come to speak
I was not able
And water through a rusted pipe
Could make the sense that I do

[Verse 2]
Gurgle, mutter
Hiss, stutter
Moan the words like water
Rush and foam and choke

[Verse 3]
Having waited
This long of a winter
I fear I only
Croak and sigh

[Chorus]
Somewhere deep within
Hear the creak
That lets the tale begin

[Verse 4]
Now the time has come to move
I was not able
Water through a rusted pipe
Could make the moves that I do

[Verse 5]
Stagger, stumble
Trip, fumble
I fear I only
Slip and slide

[Chorus]
Somewhere deep within
Hear the creak
That lets the tale begin
Somewhere deep within
Hear the creak
That lets the tale begin

 

[Verse 1:]
Somewhere in a room
With a poster on a wall
Of a man with his hand
In a fist
Is a woman who's drinking
And her dress is so tight
You can see every breath
That she takes

[Chorus:]
Every sigh, every sway
You can hear everything that they say
Something's begun like a war
Or a family or a friendship
Or a fast love affair

[Verse 2:]
The man on the wall
Is his symbol of freedom
It means he has brothers
Who believe as he does

[Verse 3:]
She is moved by
The thing that she sees in his face
Whe he talks of
The cause

[Chorus:]
Every sigh, every sway
You can hear everything that they say
Something's begun like a war
Or a family or a friendship
Or a fast love affair

[Verse 4:]
She leans against him
Her dress is so red
They talk of the salt
And the truth and the bread

[Verse 5:]
The night goes along
The fan goes around
In the room off the street
At the end of the town

[Chorus:]
Every sigh, every sway
You can hear everything that they say
Something's begun like a war
Or a family or a friendship
Or a fast love affair

 

Let's tell the future
Let's see how it's been done
By numbers. By mirrors. By water
By dots made at random on paper

By salt. By dice
By meal. By mice
By dough of cakes
By sacrificial fire

By fountains. By fishes
Writing in ashes
Birds. Herbs
Smoke from the altar

A suspended ring or the mode of laughing
Pebbles drawn from a heap
One of these things
Will tell you something

Let's tell the future
Let's see how it's been done
By dreams. By the features. By letters
By dropping hot wax into water

By nails reflecting the rays of the sun
By walking in a circle
By red hot iron
By passages in books
A balanced hatchet

A suspended ring or the mode of laughing
Pebbles drawn from a heap
One of these things
Will tell you something

Let's tell the future
Let's see how it's been done
How it's been done

 

This line is burning
Turning to ash as it hits the air
Every step is a day in the week
It's a Sunday or Monday
A march over months of the year

This life is burning
Turning to ash as it hits the air
Every death is an end in the race
It's a stopping and starting
A march over millions of years

Travel. Arrival
Years of an inch and a step
Toward a source
I'm coming to you
I'll be there in time

This land is burning
Turning to ash as it hits the air
Every line is a place on a map
It's a city or valley
A mark on these miles of fields

Travel. Arrival
Years of an inch and a step
Toward a source
I'm coming to you
I'll be there in time

This line is burning
Turning to ash as it hits the air
Every step is a day in the week
It's a Wednesday or Thursday
A march over months of the year

Travel. Arrival
Years of an inch and a step
Toward a source
I'm coming to you
I'll be there in time

I'm coming to you
I'll be there in time

Take this
Mute mouth
Broken tongue.
Now this
Dark life
Is shot through with light
