[KRS-One]
One two
Rap music, what does it mean
What is everybody in this industry for
What is everybody, buying rap for
Why do people get involved, in rap music
Rap music number one, is the voice of black people, number one
Number two, it's the LAST voice, of black people
Black people have created every music you hear out here in the streets today
Every single music, rock and roll down
Therefore; in a situation that has, all African music in it
All African music, uhh, exploiting itself of it, or coming out of it
All African influence in all it's music
And you have what is called American Music Awards
You have what is called theft
And what I would like to bring out today is rap music
As, a revolutionary tool in changing the structure of racist America

 

Wake up!
Take the pillow from your head and put a book in it
It's time for the massive BDP crew at the top of the pile

[Verse 1]
In the morning I'm yawning, at noon is when I wake up
Make up my bed break up the bread and said
Scratching my head, why am I so damn intimidating?
Is it because of laws designed to keep us waiting and waiting
Thus aiding all forms of a setback
Get back if you can't understand a rap act
This is the language of the people ready to hear the truth
I've got no juice, cause I'm not getting juiced
To have juice means you kiss and lick a lot of booty
To have respect means you simply knew a Nubie
Heard what I had to say and felt as though you'd say that too
I'm not down with the Juice Crew
But anyway I say today the message I create is great
I don't preach hate, I simply get the record straight
It's not the fault of the black race that we are misplaced
We're robbing and killing, your own medicine you taste
You built up a race on the concept of violence
Now in '90 you want silence
Well, I want science, not silence but science
Scientific fact about black
The board of education acts as if its only reality
Is talking about a Tom, Dick and Harry
So now you learn your black history it's questions and answers
Every question but the Black Panthers
Timbuctu existed when the caveman existed
Why then isn't this listed
Is it because the blackman is the original man
Or does it mean humanity is African
I don't know but these sciences are hidden
For some strange reason it's forbidden
To talk about, or converse on a political outburst
I don't believe that I'm the first
Or should I say the first one, or the first one that's done
Music like I'm still number one
But music like that or this is the incredible uplift
Those that oppose get dissed
But who will oppose the teacher when society's a wreck
So check the blackman's in effect

[Verse 2]
Near the Tigris and Euphrates Valleys in Asia
Lies the Garden of Eden
Where Adam became a father to humanity
Now don't get mad at me
But according to facts, this seems just fantasy
Because man, the most ancient man
Was found thousands of years before Adam began
And where he was found, again they can't laugh at ya
It's right, dead, smack in Africa
But due to religious and political power
We must be denied the facts, every hour
We run to school, trying to get straight A's
Let's take a trip way back in the days
To the first civilization on Earth, the Egyptians
Giving birth to science, mathematics and music
Religion, the list goes on, you choose it
Egypt was the land of spiritual blessing
Egypt was the land of facts, not guessing
People from all over the world had come
To learn from Egypt, Egypt number one
So people that believe in Greek philosophy
Know your facts, Egypt was the monopoly;
Greeks had learned from Egyptian masters
You might say "Prove it", well here's the answers:
640 to 322 B.C. originates Greek philosophy
But in that era Greece was at war
With themselves and Persia once more.
Any philosopher at that time was a criminal;
He'd be killed very simple
This indicates that Greece had no respect
For science or intellect
So how the hell you created philosophy
When you killed philosophers constantly?!
The point is is that we descend from kings
Science, art and beautiful things
African history is the world's history
This is the missing link and mystery
Once we realize that all are African
White will sit down with black and laugh again
So judge not least ye may be judged
By the judgement ye judge, ye shall be judged
Matthew seven, first verse doesn't budge
No man should walk the Earth in sludge
If you don't believe, you can go and check
To see how and where the blackman's in effect

 

[D-Nice]
Aiyyo, aiyyo Kris they know the rules
Hahahahaha, yeah ya don't stop (say what?)
A-ya don't stop (BDP in the house) a-ya don't stop
(Check it out, check it out...Yo, D!)
Yo bust it, yo yo Kris hold on
Let me give a shout out to some people, aight bust it
A Scott LaRock, and ya don't stop
A Sammy B, and ya don't stop
A Mister Cee, and ya don't stop
A Cool V, and ya don't stop
Evil E, and ya don't stop
A Easylee, and ya don't stop
A DJ Scratch, and ya don't stop
A Spinderella, and ya don't stop
Jam Master Jay, and ya don't stop
A PA Mase, and ya don't stop
So yo Kris, my mellow my man yo
Get on the mic and do the best you can

[Verse 1: KRS-ONE]
Well, the teacher comes to you, in effect
From a different style, a whole different sect
I inject, force and intellect
When I hit the mic, suckers hit the deck
I come correct and practice what I preach
I don't pimp you or rule you I teach
Come through the doors and slap up whores
Ordering them to put back on their drawers
Cause, I run their pimp
When I leave he leaves with a limp
Shrimp, I got the tartar sauce
Never underestimate the power of the force
Of the intellectual KRS-One
I don't think yet my job is done, because
I stand alone while others have to verify
Just why they are thought to be fly
Makin' the public believe that they are way up in the sky
Sort of like a rap superguy
But I, horrify and terrify the super duper rap guy
Because you're SOFT as a lullaby
While they sit on their throne lookin
Well I'm walkin in the streets of Brooklyn
Or Harlem and Queens and Bronx and
I'm even out there walkin in Compton
Cause everywhere BDP is schoolin'
So anywhere, KRS is coolin'
I'm not foolin', cause no, I'm not a fool
Don't act stupid boy, you know the rules

[D-Nice]
Word, aiyyo Kris, they act like they don't know the rules
But yo, I tell you what
Yo get on the mic and tell em what makes up KRS-One
YaknowhatI'msayin? Huh, and ya don't stop

[Verse 2: KRS-ONE]
Yo, from off the sidewalk I grab the mic and talk
Born nineteen-sixty-five in the state of New York
My name is Kris Parker, KRS-One for short
I slap up crews and rock parties for sport
Lived on the streets about eight years straight
There I got my education and learned to debate
So when I pick up the microphone I know what I'm sayin
Education doesn't come from simply obeyin'
The curriculum, of the school criteria
In fact what I learned I found inferior
I'm not a Muslim but I do support them
My Father in heaven taught me and taught them
I'm not a Christian, but I won't diss em
I'm not a Jew, I don't practice Judaism
I'm not a Buddhist, but Buddha's a master
I don't eat beef pork nor Diet Shasta
Reason for this is very simple indeed
When it comes to music everybody's in need
You got wealthy artists spendin, money loosely
You ask about the culture, they talk 'bout Gucci
Metaphysics, the science of life
And how to live, free from strife
Walk with ease, and no disease
Understand that I am the breeze
And the trees, oceans and seas
And the B and the D and the P's
Suckers try it, but I don't buy it
When I speak you seek to stay quiet
Shut up! What what? You better stay cool
And heed the warning boy, you know the rules!

[D-Nice]
Ah one two yeah, and ya don't stop
Ah three four (say what?) and ya don't stop
Ah five six (pop pop) and ya don't stop
Ah seven eight (get down) and ya don't stop
Aiyyo yo Kris, this goes out to all them house nigga
(foot shufflin) moonshine (hamhock eatin) pickled-pig tuggin
(tap dancin) jheri curl activist (program directors)
That don't wanna play rap music (that's right, ya know what?)
Yo, ya know the rules
Ha, ha-ha hah!

 

[Kwame Ture]
History can never be made by one man, we must smash this one quickly
History is made only by the masses of the people, this is clear
Even a, cursory glance at the falasfallacious presentation
Of history by the American capitalist system, will demonstrate just this
Take George Washington, as bad as he is
Put him in the middle of Valley Forge, by himself, surrounded
By the British, he can do nothing
*laughing and applause*
Mhmhmmmhmm
Take Martin Luther King as righteous as he is
Put him in the middle of Birmingham by himself, speaking out against racism
He would be lynched
But you take this same King, you take this same Washington
Put them in Valley Forge, put them in Alabama
Surround them with thousands of people who have the same ideas they do
Willing to make those ideas reality and the situation changes drastically

 

[KRS-One]
Ya know, so we wanna clear the air
And let you all know what time of day it really is
BDP are black revolutionaries
First for humanity, then for the upliftment of Africa
And it goes a little somethin, like this

 

[Intro]
KRS and Melodie live together with D-Nice and Harmony
Side by side with Rebecca, D-Square, Sidney
BDP!
Yes!

[Hook]
I got a hundred guns two hundred clips
Going to New York, New York
I got a hundred guns two hundred clips
Going to New York, New York

[Verse 1]
Well
I'm driving my car, cross country
With a hundred guns and about six G
Me driving through a town, me see two cops
They're looking at me funny like they really want stop
Me just turn my head, and gwan on me way
Put hip-hop inna de tape and press play
Me get one block and me hear "Pull over!"
The guns are in the trunk with a thin cover
They ask me for ID, driver's license prefer
Me ask them "Was I breaking any law, officer?"
They said "Oh yes, you passed county line
Niggers in these here parts now is a crime"
I said "Is that so?" and cocked back me nine
Bust two shots inna the bwoy head top
His knees just a-buckle and his body a-drop
Me put the car in drive and me did not stop
When I get to New York I'm gonna set up shop
Bwoy!

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Me in a hotel, off 95 North
Everything's fine, and yes me on course
Me walk to a bathroom, take a lickle leak
But right out the window I can hear the cops speak
"We have the place surrounded we're about to move in"
That's when I pick up my nine and just begin
Pump! Pump! Pump! First cop a-hit the ground
Pump! Pump! Pump! Second cop a-go down
Me jump out the window trying not to make a sound
Me run to the car, gunfire all around
I start up the engine, bust the barricade
All because illegally I want to get paid
Pump! Pump! Pump! There goes my tire
Me spun out of control, the car caught on fire
Me jump out the car, put my hands in the air
Cops just surrounding me with pistols everywhere
They put me in the backseat of their car handcuffed
Pushed out them chests like they're big rough and tough
A cop come and said "You'll never sell your guns now"
I said "It doesn't matter, you'll sell them anyhow
You take the guns from me, you sell them for a fee
Any way you put it they'll get in the city"
Hahaha... so still

[Hook]

Fire!

 

[Intro]
Hah, giddyap!
Ha ha ha hah..
Another dope dope dope style
By the massive BDP crew
Of course, I will now present to you
A different view. The 1990s!
Of course, eighty-nine is behind me
Check it out

[Hook]
It's called breath control, breath control, breath control stylee
Breath control a-lone, breath control A-LONE
Breath control, breath control, breath control stylee
Breath control a-lone..

[Verse 1]
It's KRS-One, yes the Teacher
I wear Clarks and only Nike sneaker
In your speaker, is the new style
Dedicated to the intelligent child
In the front row, or behind me
We're gonna pull somebody file for the 90's
You want lyrics? We come correct
BDP, only movin with respect
The other MC's, they can't believe me
A when I rhyme it sound just like a CD
We don't lip-sync, we go all live
On stage, I bring about four or five
That's D-Nice, Sydney, and Melodie
And myself, Harmony, and Willie D
We come humble, we just grumble
While other MC's crew just crumble
They want dancers, they want lighting
They want effects, to make them look exciting
But it's frightening, cause without that
The whole crew, is whick whick whick whack
BDP comes, with the cheapest
And perform miracles like Jesus
The total respect, we achieve it
And the big head-liner can't believe it

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Ha ha ha ha ha hah..
Well the styles I, usually dish out
Are so dope that you don't wanna miss out
We got pages, of the dope stuff
So in the record store, you can't pass by us
Get the album, hear the music
And hold on so you just don't lose it
As a reference, for any MC
That wanna test, K-R-S, O-N-E
Cause I've been watchin, these other rap groups
They walk around like they're some kinda big soup
You can't touch them, you only see them
In a arena or big coliseum
So when you watch them, for a second
Them sound nothing like they do on record
Them sound cheesy, them sound wheezy
For twenty dollars boy you know them never please me
So I see this, and prevent this
It's like goin for a checkup at the dentist
Cause when you come to a BDP performance
The microphone, had better have endurance
Cause we'll check it, and then wreck it
And then the soundman has got to accept it

[Hook]

 

[KRS-One]
All you white people out there that think you're down with America can
Forget it. Cause they TAX all of us. All of us, one by one. Just
Take a look at Leona Helm-Helmsley. Taxed her, she's white I believe
*laughter* Yeah threw her butt right in jail. She ain't nothin but
Another ho, according to this system. *laughter* You ain't pay your
Taxes ho, get back in jail. *uproarious laughter*

 

[KRS-One]
Give it to em!

Nuff respect! And praise to the creator
Over the years it seems that I became a
Landmark, in the hip-hop field of art
I shed light, yet my skin is dark
I'm not concerned with climbin the chart
Cause why should you pay when it comes from the heart?
I'll start, cause only Jah will create it
I'll just name it, Edutainment
People sit and they look at my album
Like a problem, they try to solve em
They don't know, it only leads the way
To a bright more positive day
By itself, it's NOT the bright day
Sit up straight, and hear what I say
Fear and ignorance, I'm down for stoppin this
But the bright day is your conciousness
I am poet, my words will heal you
I'm not a phony I'll really feel you
That's why I walk and talk to my nation
Wherever they are, in any situation
They usually ask for an autograph
And I'll whip out the pen and just write Blast-
-Master, K-R-S, O-N-E
BDP, Peace and Unity
But do not concentrate on the paper
Concentrate on the laws of the creator
Cause when the paper's gone, it will deceive you
But Allah will never leave you

Nothing I say now is hypothetical
These are the facts, a little metaphysical
We are one, every heart every lung
So why then was the black man hung?
He was hung by the so-called Christians
That went to church, and did not listen
See Jesus couldn't stand politics
So they nailed him to a crucifix
Then it was that way, today it's a trigger
So why is the Pope such a political figure?
I don't know, but it's really beyond me
But through knowledge, they'll NEVER con me
Cause from Jesus Christ to right now
Everytime a black man speaks up, KA-POW
See people concentrate on the leader
And not the message comin through the speaker
If the Christians really heard Christ
The black man never would've lived this life
My point is that do not concentrate
On what I state, create, or debate
I might be great, and you might admire
But what I say is to take you MUCH higher
MORE higher than the physical plane
To the plane of forces in the astral plane
The mental plane, and the final three
They're all around you, yet you can't see
So grab the sphere of life and aim it
And you'll be guided by Edutainment

 

Yeah...
You could call a man a bum with disgust on your morning run
Cause he lives outside in the street, you don't know this
But you've failed to realise that the one you so despise
Reflects yourself cos every black man is homeless
You could take your Alka-Seltzer while you talk about shelter
You might even wanna talk about a little loan
Cause no matter how rich you become you'll always be two, not one
Cause believe it or not, America ain't your home
We've been taught to say our name, Afro-American, all the same
Not fully American but gettin' there very slowly
Cause to fully be American, you know, you gotta take out the word 'Afro'
Now they've relaxed I hear they might as well call us Toby
See, Afro and black are African, while theft is American
So how can Afro-American make much sense?
Your ancestors come from Africa
By stealing them now you're born in America
So the black man is homeless even though he pays rent
Some black people say "We built this place
So we are American, but of the black race"
Well let me make this little topic known
The Japanese also built this place
In technology and they're winnin' the race
But at the end of the day the Japanese can go home
Do you see the point that I'm getting at?
I'm not a racist, I'm statin' a fact
Blacks are actually prisoners of war
Cause while South Africa continues to fight
We try our best to look more and more white
Proof that the blacks have been stripped of their core
Well, I guess I didn't sing and dance enough
For black radio to play this stuff
But this ain't soft like ice-cream with a sugar cone
I'm only here to state one fact
Wake up African, your colour is black
And every black man is homeless cause he ain't got no home

 

I've been taught to respect my elders and behave
Even if when they were young they sold slaves
Truth and understandin' is what I crave
In the land of the thief, home of the slave
Turn your page to a brief demonstration
Cos now in '90 it's strictly information I'm givin'
Teachin' on a regular basis
Today's lecture is about The Racist
We're not out to exaggerate or diss him
But show the symptoms and facts of racism
Understand The Racist ain't equal
There's about five different types of racist people
First of the five different types of cases
Is the individual brought up racist
Here you have young men and women
Brought up in the Great White Way opinion
This opinion introduced by the parent
To the civilised becomes transparent
The civilised man could look through the faces
Make the analysis and see The Racist
Number two case which y'all must hear
Is the individual racist out of fear
Here you have people that fear the African
And conjure up new ways of trappin' him
Number three is the unconscious racist
Not knowin' they're racist they invade your spaces
They say, "I'm not a racist, I'm not a bigot"
Yet they allow it to go on and won't admit it
Number four is the money racist
The one that used the topics of sheer economics
They say, "Owning a business isn't for the black man
He don't want that", yet they went and took his land
Damn, that's like a rock in a hard place
You don't have your land yet this ain't your space
America was built by every other race
Except the European that runs this place
What a waste, America's doomed
To be overthrown by the righteous real soon
But last but not least racial prejudice
Is the black man speakin' out of ignorance
Whitey this and Ching-Chow that
Is not how the intelligent man acts
You can't blame the whole white race
For slavery, cos this ain't the case
A large sum of white people died with black
Tryin' hard to fight racial attacks
The media wants you to think that no whites
Really fought and died for Civil Rights
But once we have a true sense of history
You'll see this too as a mystery
If black and white didn't argue the most
They could clearly see the government's screwin' 'em both
