[Chorus]
I lost my lucky ball and chain
Now she's four years gone
Just five feet tall and sick of me
And all my rattling on

[Verse 1]
She threw away her baby-doll
I held on to my pride
But I was young and foolish then
I feel old and foolish now

[Verse 2]
Confidentially, she never called me baby-doll
Confidentially I never had much pride
But now I rock a bar stool
And I drink for two
Just pondering this time bomb in my mind

[Chorus]
I lost my lucky ball and chain
Now she's four years gone
Just five feet tall and sick of me
And all my rattling on

[Post-Chorus]
She walked away from a happy man
I thought I was so cool
I just stood there whistling
"There goes the bride" as she walked out the door
"There goes the bride" as she walked out the door

[Verse 3]
I could shake my tiny fist and swear I wasn't wrong
But what's the sense in arguing when you're all alone?
Sure as you can't steer a train
You can't change your fate
And when she told me off that day
I knew I'd lost my home

[Verse 4]
Confidentially, I never told you of her charms
Confidentially, we never had a home
But this railroad apartment was the perfect place
When she'd sit and hold me in her arms

[Chorus]
I lost my lucky ball and chain
Now she's four years gone
Just five feet tall and sick of me
And all my rattling on

[Post-Chorus]
She walked away from a happy man
I thought I was so cool
I just stood there whistling
"There goes the bride" as she walked out the door
"There goes the bride" as she walked out the door
"There goes the bride" as she walked out the door

 

I'll never know what you'll find
When you open up your letter box tomorrow
'Cause a little bird never tells me anything I want to know
She's my best friend, she's a sparrow
And I'll never never know
What you never never never want to know
When you know what you are, O

If I had a pair of eyes on the back of my head for each time
You forgot to take out all the things you forgot to talk about
When you took a bite out of my spine
I would have a lot of eyes on me by this time, wouldn't I?
Wouldn't that just be fine?

Too late or soon to make noise about love and there's no time for sorrow
Run around in the rain with a hole in the brain till tomorrow

I'll never know what you'll find
When you open up your letter box tomorrow
'Cause a little bird never tells me anything I want to know
She's my best friend, she's a sparrow
And I'll never never know what you never never never want to know
When you know what you are, O

 

Hot Cha, where are you?
Everybody's eyes are closed
I can't see why I miss you so
So, hot Cha, where are you?

First time hot Cha went away
A floating island was his home
Then the phone rang off the hook
And hot Cha had to come back home

Hot Cha, where are you?
Everybody's eyes are closed
I can't see why I miss you so
So, hot Cha, where are you?

Second time he went away
Left the bathtub running over
Stereo on and cooking bacon
Never came back to tell us why

If that honey would come back
We would throw such a party
Drink and cook the prodigal son
Fondue forks for everybody

Hot Cha, where are you?
Everybody's eyes are closed
I can't see why I miss you so
So, hot Cha, where are you?
Hot Cha, where are you?
Hot Cha, where are you?

 

Hang on...hang on tight...

They might be giants (Boy)
They might be giants
They might be rain
They might be heat
They might be frying up a stalk of wheat

They might be giants (Boy)
They might be giants
They might be brain
They might be washed
They might be Dr. Spock's back-up band

...To make the merry-go-round go faster
So that everyone needs to hang on tighter
Just to keep from being thrown to the wolves...

Tabloid footprints in your hair
Tabloid footprints everywhere
We can't be silent
'Cause they might be giants
And what are we gonna do unless they are

They might be giants (Boy)
They might be giants
They might be bald
They might be snow
They might be something else in the snow

Hang on tight...

They might be giants (Boy)
They might be giants
They might be fake
They might be lies
They might be big, big, fake, fake lies

Tabloid footprints in your hair
Tabloid footprints everywhere
We can't be silent
'Cause they might be giants
And what are we gonna do unless they are

They might be giants... (Boy)
They might be giants... (Boy)
They might be giants... (Boy)
They might be giants... (Boy)

They might be giants... (Boy)
They might be giants... (Boy)
They might be giants... (Boy)
They might be giants... (Boy)

They might be giants... (Boy)
They might be giants... (Boy)
They might be giants... (Boy)
They might be giants... (Boy)

They might be giants... (Boy)
They might be giants... (Boy)
They might be giants... (Boy)
They might be giants... (Boy)

 

We're in a road movie to Berlin
Can't drive out the way we drove in
So sneak out this glass of Bourbon
And we'll go

We were once so close to Heaven
Peter came out and gave us medals
Declaring us the nicest of the damned

Time won't find the lost
It'll sweep up our skeleton bones
So take the wheel and I will take the pedals

We're in a road movie to Berlin
Can't drive out the way we drove in
So sneak out this glass of Bourbon
And we'll go
