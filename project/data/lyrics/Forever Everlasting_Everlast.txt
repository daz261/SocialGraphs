Here we are, my friend
Once again I'm inclined to rhyme one time
So won't you lend me your ear? 'Cuz it's clear
That this here has no pain
If this song was the blues you'd be sheddin' a tear
Like a baby, maybe, is should a held back
Some of you look shocked, I guess you couldn't tell that
I was here to drop knowledge, college is irrelevant
My next move, to prove I'm smooth but still intelligent
Expressin' the lesson with sheer precision
First hear me out then make a decision
On whether Everlast knows what time it is
Does this song belong in the rhyming biz?
Yes, I think so 'cuz I'm a pioneer
Blazing a trail across a new frontier
I go the length of growing strength as I get older
'Cuz I'm a syndicate soldier
All affections left behind, there's two more gears to grind
Before I'm through, I'm sure that you will find
A new respect for the rhymes I inject
Through your eardrum, don't play dumb
Just let me get to the point of my address
Unless you feel you can't cope
This song is on the table to make you dance, so
Get up, and if you don't leave the premises
I'm new to the crew so you can call me a genesis
Born to perform and please a large crowd
Of people at night and to my right is El-O
A scandalous brother known for being treacherous
A sucker made a move and that's the reason
Fletcher was forced to put his head out
He got too close to me, two by my side
And that's that's how it's supposed to be
These are my brothers, and they've been around me
Since back in the days when the Syndicate found me
They are the people deserving of credit
As my name gained fame, they made sure I wouldn't let it
Go to my head, instead I keep my feet down
Unlike sucker's from the past I beat down
The fatal mistake was to break on my confidence
Overall, their fall was due to overconfidence
As we go, the ego's all start acting up
With statements of greatness, the rhymes aren't backing up
Talking louder as they get bolder
But there's no defense against a syndicate soldier
As we reach the final stage
Some think I'll engage in a conflict
That's sick with violent rage
I gain fame from my name, Everlast
How long can this hype about a devil last?
It started as fun but everyone took it serious
Now it's seems, I'm seen as delirious
But that's okay, I'll stay under rated
And good things will come to all that have waited
For the brother of a lighter skin to begin
Droppin' knowledge with weight 'cuz you rate paper thin
Science is one thing, knowledge is another
What do I mean when I say that I'm a brother?
Being a brother is a state of mind
For all those who chose to remain unblind
I grow in wisdom as I get older
That's right I'm white and I'm a syndicate soldier

 

[ Everlast ]
Yo yo yo yo yo yo yo
I'm in the studio with my brother, the Half Asiatic
You know, the Fraction of Black Skin and the Smite of White
It's my brother Kool Nick
We about to drop some science on this track about God and what not
You know, the world
So watch me get busy

[ VERSE 1: Everlast ]
Step up, bow your head and be greatful
You hunger for knowledge? I'm serving a plate full
A 12 course meal on a black plate of wax
So MC to feed (then sit back and relax)
And try and digest the data I fed you
I act and react this way cause I'm bred to
The color of my skin something I take pride in
Still my people insist on hidin
Behind the aAerican dream and its lies
(Like the Home of the Free and mom's apple pie
I thought this was a melting pot) I guess not
King stood up up for his rights and he got shot

I speak no evil

Yo Nick, do me a favor, man
Step in

[ VERSE 2: Kool Nick ]
This world is crazy, it must be sick
Be like Nick and get righteous real quick
Jews, Muslims, Buddhists, Baptists
Protestants, Hare Krishnas, Catholics
Seek salvation and repentance
This rhyme is from the heart and I meant this
Jesus - shedded his blood for me
He hung on a cross (yo, you know the story)
Nowadays a lot of people are tryin
To worship satan, but you're gonna fry in
Hell, imagine burnin up forever
The forecast is heat, there's no change of weather
Damn, the devil will never twist this
Mind with the mark of the beast or the 666
To God there no one equal
That's why I speak no evil

I speak no evil

[ VERSE 3: Everlast ]
Listen to the story of my Savior
And how he gave up
Life so you could live
That's a hell of a gift to give
(Kick it, E)
Now as I take a look around
I don't see many people down
With my cause, huh, that's scary
Tryin to diss the Son of Mary
You're bein lured, so take the bait and
Fall into the trap of satan
Then your life is over without no sequel
That's why I speak no evil

I speak no evil

(This style is terrific) --] KRS-One

[ VERSE 4: Kool Nick ]
E (yo) this environment's strange
Brothers gettin shanked on the streets for gold chains
Some smoke crack, cocaine and jumbo
Brains so fried, when they talk they mumble
How could this be society
A ( ? ) place (where none of us wanna be)
People gettin judged by the color of skin tone
It wasn't like this way back with the Flinstones
It's odd, sometimes I get kept back
Because I'm half black, people can't accept that
Yo, accept me for what I am
But what can I do? Cause none of em give a damn
All they want is to drive a Mercedes
Have a million dollars (and live like the Brady's)
But anyways, time is windin, not rewindin
Look in your heart and start findin
Peace and love, no matter what your creed is
(Understand the knowledge at hand) and believe this

I speak no evil

[ Everlast ]
Word up

Yo
We got my man Lofy in the house, man
[ Kool Nick ]
Got my boy Chris
My brother Low-Dog
My brother Fry
My lady T
[ Everlast ]
Yo, we got Shawny Shawn
[ Kool Nick ]
My brother Shawny Shawn in the place
[ Everlast ]
Yo, what's up
[ Kool Nick ]
We got my brother E over in the corner over there
[ Everlast ]
Hahaha - yo, don't ever speak no evil
[ Kool Nick ]
Can't forget D-Rock
Can't forget Kev Mack
[ Everlast ]
Yo, I like to send a shout out to the Almighty Supreme Being God
[ Kool Nick ]
God
[ Everlast ]
Word up
[ Kool Nick ]
Cause you know you rule
[ Everlast ]
Yo, yeah, yeah
We outta here
[ Kool Nick ]
I'm out
This is the Half-Asiatic signin off
Peace
[ Everlast ]
The Half-Asiatic, you know
And the Everlasting

 

(What is it?)
(This is everlasting)

Step up while I inject
An overdose of intellect
An overload of my vibrations
Better yet a new sensation
I was lost but then he found me
Though corruption did surround me
I was taken to a higher
Level of earth and fire
Where the souls of men would burn
They were taught but did not learn
About the righteous laws of God
We're all just seeds among the sod
Take any roots and tryin to grow
Though the process may seem slow
Please take heed to my suggestion
Learn the answer to the question
What is this

(This is everlasting)
(What is it?)
What is this?
(This is everlasting)

(Heavens to Mergatroid)

(What is it?)

Not speakin on my physical, my mental, or my aura
I'm speaking on my soul, for to burn would be true horror
There's no such thing as luck, your life is in the hands of God
So do not treat his righteous laws with blatant disregard
In order to follow the Lord's path, here's all you must do
Do unto each of your brothers as you'd have them do you
This golden rule is all you need, and you will be rewarded
The man that don't, will pay the price and believe me, you can't afford it
Because

(This is everlasting)
(What is it?)
What is this?
(This is everlasting)

This is for the ones who war over whose God is the right one
Can it be the Asian one, the black one or the white one?
The answer to the question really isn't controversial
There is only one God and his love is universal
If you sin and crave redemption, all you need to do is ask him
Then you will be fully prepared for a life that's everlasting
So take heed to the words I say, grab a good book and get hip to
The teachings of the holy Q'uran or the Bible's holy scripture
Because

(This is everlasting)
(What is it?)
What is this?
(This is everlasting)

CHORUS
Talkin bout the rhythm
All we need is rhythm
Talkin bout the rhythm
All we need is rhythm

[Verse 1: Everlast ]
I'm Everlast, born to be a Caucasian
But it makes no difference what persuasion
You are, as long as you know how to get up
Get on the floor and start working a sweat up
To a musical measure that makes you move
Soon as the needle's dropped into the groove
So get up and dance to the gift I'm givin
Forget all your troubles, get into the rhythm

CHORUS
SAMPLES:
(You make me feel so gorgeous)
(What more can I say?)

[Verse 2: Donald D ]
Yo yo, you know what the world needs
We need (peace)
(Keep their heads clapping)
(The music just turns me on)

CHORUS

[Verse 3: Donald D]
You linger for the rap singer
When Donald D brings the
Party to the tilt my presence is worldwide
You don't dance to this - that's suicide
Put your hands into the air, I'm the MC cop
The girlies are pipin hot
Notorious rhymer is how I'm livin
Don't step to me, step to the rhythm

CHORUS
(You make me feel so gorgeous)

[Everlast ]
And like I said before, the worlds need a lot more (unity)
(Okay buddy - start playin)
(The music just turns me on)

CHORUS

[Verse 4: Ice-T ]
Listen to the track as it rolls, watch the mic as it glows
The lethal weapon got you trapped inside a dance mode
Ice-T is throwin words at you like dodge ball, y'all
You gotta move or get hit, and if you're hit you fall
No jokin, no boastin, no braggin
Grip the mic like a .44 magnum
Dust you off if you're suckers, I ain't
You want me to write soft rhymes, I'm sorry, I can't
I rock the rhythm

CHORUS

 

[Verse 1: Everlast]
Get up everybody and listen to this rhyme
My name is Everlast and yo, I'm always on time
I got what it takes to make this groove complete
And when my DJ is cuttin, he's never missin a beat
I'm down with the Syndicate and they're down with me
I'm also down with Divine, Bilal and Quincy D
Tairrie B., DJ Lethal and my brother Kool Nick
Kid Jazz, Scratch, Bango and Cutmaster Quick
I've worked hard and long to master this trade
And to quote my other song yo, I'm just out to get paid
So sleep on me now for my time will come
Everlast lasts forever, that's why I'm number one

[Chorus]
I got the knack
(You got it)
(You know I feel alright)

[Verse 2: Everlast]
Everlast is in effect
Gettin big respect
Then I collect big checks
1's, 5's, 10's, 20's
100 g's and I'm pullin honeys
Left and right, day and night
You gotta see it to believe it, it's quite a sight
They're all on my tip to get a sip
Of this poetical performer that's fully equipped
But I'm out to get paid, not to get laid
All across the country my records gettin played
On radio stations, clubs and on tours
And after every show I make three encores
Sleep on me now for my time will come
Everlast last forever, that's why I'm number one

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Everlast]
Step up, place your bet and I'll serve you fortune
But first I must issue just one word of caution
Dope lyric presentations are my sole notoriety
Everlast is on the rise movin through society
My voice is moist recitin choice vocals
Respected worldwide and feared by locals
Poppin junk out your punk mouth makin bets
It's too late for regrets, it's time to pay your debts
E-v-e-r-l-a-s-t is the name that I bear
A poetic demi-god with skin that's fair
So sleep on me now for my time will come
Everlast lasts forever, that's why I'm number one

[Chorus]

[Verse 4: Everlast]
Now there's too many people in this world tryin to play me
Like I'm some kind of sucker constantly they disobey me
Tellin me what's sellin, what kinda records get charted
Sound like him, sound like her - but they all sound retarded
Takin very little time to write down a rhyme
It's confusing to see so many people so blind
Some think that it's a sell-out rhymin to this beat
But Everlast can take any groove and make it sound complete
I got the knack

 

[ VERSE 1: Everlast ]
I don't do work, do damage
Everytime I pick up the mic I manage
To diss someone or get somebody pissed
Take off my coat, clear my throat and begin to dismiss
All you fucked up punks that pollute mankind
Give me the mic, take a hike and give me peace of mind
Don't shout, shut your mouth, I'm trying to think clearly
You say my ryhmes are dope? Check this out, this is merely
The start of something big, a spark ignitin a fire
You think the party has hit its peak? I'll take it a level higher
I'm Everlast, get off your ass to cut a rug
You'll understand my gameplan and say, "Man that kid's bugged"
(So all ya bloodclots) tellin you like take heed
I'll stomp your heads until you're dead or at least till you bleed

Fuck everyone

[ VERSE 2: Everlast ]
It's the Syndicate, I'll say what I want to
I'll say, "Hey, fuck off punk," just to taunt you
Into believing the ryhmes that I'm conceivin
Are meant for only one thing, and that's achievin
My goal, so I can stroll with a fat money roll
Cross the bridge over troubled waters and pay the toll
With no bother, no fuss, in God I trust
But the rest pay cash - that's a must
The reason I'm teasin you is it's pleasin me
To see how funky this can be
When I grab that mic I'm like a three wheel bike
I'm always on a roll, I'm always good as gold
So before you smack lip stick and try to talk shit
I tell you now the battle's over and the joint is lit, so quit

[ VERSE 3: Everlast ]
All hell breaks loose and it's a little known fact
That I attract and cause a crowd to react
Like an atomic explosion on the Pacific ocean
The crowd gets large and I got this notion
All I wanna do is speak my ryhme and get paid
Cause it's my trade to the played and watch suckers get slayed
And put out of business, come on, what is this?
You came too late boy, class has been dismissed
Cancelled. terminated, put to an end
So break north, find a new school to attend
Cause you know I'm gonna say what I wanna
Grab the microphone and let my knowledge be born of
Intelligence, excellence and razor sharp wit
It's no shit, it's always gotta be legit
And up to par, no matter who you are
I know I'm not the best but I still leave scars
On your brain cell, what in the hell?

Fuck everyone

(Everybody)
Fuck em!
(Fuck em)
(Everybody)
Fuck em!
(Fuck em)
(Everybody)
Fuck em!
(Fuck em)
( *scratching of* )
(Everybody)

[ VERSE 4: Everlast ]
I got Tipper Gore protestin my lyrics
Fuck that bitch, I don't need a clearance!
To rock my ryhmes, speak my mind
You can't censor me, the public's not blind
It's time they knew what's going on
You shouldn't have the power to stop a song
Even if you don't like what you hear
Even if the song is striking fear
Into your heart, body, soul and brain
It's my opinion, so it's my domain
Fuck all those standin in my way
Step to me and you'll have to pay
The price I set, so pay your debts
Fuck with me and you'll have regrets

Fuck everyone

Fuck em!
Fuck em!
Fuck them!
Fuck em!
I said fuck em!
Fuck em now!
Fuck em!
Fuck them now!
Fuck em!

Yeah
And fuck you!
Fuck em!
Hahahahaha
