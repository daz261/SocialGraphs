[Verse 1]
Too many puppies are being shot in the dark
Too many puppies are trained not to bark
At the sight of blood that must be spilled
So that we may maintain our oil fields

[Refrain]
Too many puppies
Too many puppies

[Verse 2]
Too many puppies are taught to heel
Too many puppies are trained to kill
On the command of men wearing money belts
That buy mistresses sleek animal pelts

[Refrain]
Too many puppies
Too many puppies
Too many pup-pup-pup-pup-pup-pup-puppies
Too many puppies

[Verse 3]
Too many puppies with guns in their hands
Too many puppies in foreign lands
Are dressed up sharp in suits of green
And placed upon the war machine

[Outro]
Too many puppies are just like me
Too many puppies are afraid to see
The visions of the past brought to life again
Too many puppies, too many dead men

 

[Verse 1]
An overaged boy of 39 has left the wing today
The first time in his life he's made that step
Be numbed by the society and plagued by his insecurity
He's entered in a race that must be won
One of the animals has left its cage today
In search of better things, so it seems to be
But in this land of polyurethane
Things are apt to get a bit hot

[Chorus]
As the toys go winding down

[Verse 2]
C.G. The Mexican is a friend of mine
We used to sit around the house watching *Evil Dead*
Talking about the way it used to be
Skit dat daddle dee dee
We used to pull the stripers out of San Pablo Bay
Now the delta waters going down SoCal
And the stripers start to fade away
It's pudding time! It's pudding time!

[Chorus]
As the toys go winding down
As the toys go winding down
As the toys go winding down
As the toys go winding down

 

[Instrumental]

[Spoken Verse]
Why do we do this, CG and I?
Every night vegetables
Minds numbed by THC
I've got my pen, CG the remote
Laurel and Hardy is the best bet at 4am on a Friday
No dreads about the working day after, though
Funny thing about weekends when you're unemployed
They don't mean quite so much
Except that you get to hang out with your working friends
We got a spaghetti western here on 36
I like spaghetti westerns
I like the way the boots are all reverbed out walking across the hardwood floor
In fact, everything's got that big reverb sound
Well what do I do now?
Go to sleep?
Pull the pud?
We need new pornos
Guess I'm still writin'

[Refrain]
Stoned stoned again
Stoned stoned again
Stoned stoned again
Stoned stoned again

[Instrumental]

[Refrain]
Stoned stoned again
Stoned stoned again
Stoned stoned again
Stoned stoned again
Stoned stoned again
Stoned stoned again
Stoned stoned again
Stoned stoned again

[Instrumental]
