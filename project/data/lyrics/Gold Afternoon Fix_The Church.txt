There, smoke turns into serpents in the air
Beware, there's no sanctuary anywhere
On this very spot, a great city once stood
It oozed with evil but it felt so good
Well I don't know
Where did it go?

And here, there's lots of method in their madness dear
And we're considering remaining here
In this very house a giant was born
With two angry eyes and one sharp black horn
Well I don't know
How could he grow?

The fountains gush wine
The chimneys spurt flowers
Where me and my friends pass the fleeting hours
Well yes and no
Where did they go?

Goodbye, there's no reason, there's no alibi
I'll try to write you a letter from the cyclone's eye
On this very day, a hundred years before
They opened up the future like it was a door
Well I don't know
Where did it go?

The towers stretch up, the spires spiral odd
Behind the vicar's gate, the sign, "Beware of God"
Well I don't know
Where did he go?

 

Beyond the city, and evening dust
Dreams and thunder rattle the rust
You had an idea that you won't have again
She's forgotten your name and hopes you'll do the same
Start of the ash, and the end of the flames
Burning you turning you

There was a lifetime spent in the sun
Hundreds of chances, blew every one
Dice rolled, double six, double six, double six
Owner of trouble, flesh blood and bricks
You had an idea that you won't have again
She's forgotten your name and hopes you'll do the same
The start of the ash and the end of the flames
Turning you burning you

Oh Monday morning, the cracks become quite clear
Oh Monday morning, take me back, leave me hare
Beyond the city, and evening dust
Dreams and thunder rattle the rust
You had an idea that you won't have again
She's forgotten your name and hopes you'll do the same
Start of the ash, and the end of the flames
Burning you turning you around

 

Combustion, suggestions, roaring engines
Jewels and lathes that build a world
Titanic Howard Hughes, an aimless king
Always spoiling the best things you done
So red squares and wavy leaves
Delicate glass kisses, delicate lips
Russian autumn heart

Testing, digressing, falling to the earth
Red-hot spaceships with soil so rich
A trillion pennies for a handful of dust
A sight only witnessed by a mountain of ice
So red squares and wavy leaves
Sibling link meets Manchurian mink
Russian autumn heart

Combustion, suggestions, roaring engines
Jewels and lathes that rule the world
Titanic Howard Hughes, an aimless king
Always spoiling the best things you done
So red squares and wavy leaves
Delicate glass kisses, delicate lips
Russian autumn heart

 

The universe is female
Eluding the science of men
You sway and you swagger with your neat little dagger
You're gonna blow it again

I'll prove her existence in everything
The soul of her rivers and stones
Her acquiescence in everything
Her essence, her presence, her bones

Lust and love take the masculine
Ambition and war take the boys
Pin the tail on the alpha male
A little man making big noise

It's not the engine or chassis
It's not the weapon or length
Your war dance I guess got this place in this mess
But there's something that's stronger than strength

Metaphor is a goddess
A king that's fit for a queen
The opposite side of that armored old hide
I hope you know what I mean

 

Here for now, here for now
An island coincidence away
Boarding a train always leaving today
Approaching a station starts to slow
Ushered out, no will against the flow

Dark as the night comes to share
With stars in her hair
And grand majestic flair
Framed, a world passes by
With the sound of a young girl's sigh
Man carrying a brow
Smoke rises from the crowd

Here for now, here for now
Tug in the sound as if to say
There's left a part of now in yesterday
The hurry for fear to miss the show
Not as strong as the wind's eternal blow

Wondering if the leaves will fall in May
Only know if I decide to stay

 

Don't come to pieces in my hand
White stars reflecting dust and sand
That perfume makes me think of grief
Shake the faith shake the belief

Who's there to say that we're living this moment
Feels like I'm in a play
The sets and the props of this, your apartment
Seem to be fading away, fading away

So I wander through these rooms
I feel the orbit of the moons
And I dream what I become
And all's forgotten by the sun
