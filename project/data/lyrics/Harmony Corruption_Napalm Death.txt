[Verse 1]
Witness torment in its purest form
Impossible definition of infinite pain

[Verse 2]
Look into my eyes
What do you think you see?
What you see is not me
But a dormant stage of what I'm expected to be

[Chorus]
Realities lifeline cuts through me
Forever destined to a life of misery
Realities lifeline cuts through me
It manifests my vision conquest

[Verse 3]
Mourn not the dead
The living suffer
Enter me
Withess torment

 

[Verse 1]
Previous times you stuck by me
Relations fine undeniably
Mutual trust and honesty
The essential recipe

[Verse 2]
There's two sides to a coin
Opinions numbered many
Yet resolve came with ease
Compromised and regret-free

[Verse 3]
Then the change of expression
A unit of friends and the chance to be free

[Verse 4]
Your thoughts on these cast a jealous light
A concensus of hate to accompany

[Verse 5]
A vindictive acid taste
Flows from your chalice
Valued friendships tainted
Martyr of malice

[Verse 6]
Then the final straw
Violent intimidation
Your self acclaimed pacification
Brushed aside for self-gratification
Blatant ignorance
Martyr of malice

 

[Verse 1]
Looking from outside inwards
A view to dumbfound the most outspoken minds

[Chorus 1]
Silent screams from an unfit Earth
Battered and bruised with nowhere to hide

[Verse 2]
Disasters man made and natural
Gradually pushing to absolute imbalance
On the scales of survival
Soon to tip in favour of extinction

[Verse 3]
An unrelenting dioxin cloud
Propelled to dispel our oxygen
Slowly seizing up our lungs
And choking the ground we depend upon

[Chorus 1]
Silent screams from an unfit Earth
Battered and bruised with nowhere to hide

[Verse 4]
Transforming aquatic inhabitance
Overcome by cocktails of sludge and chemicals

[Verse 5]
Interfering with life on which so many rely
Then dumping our shit to economise

[Verse 6]
Wanton destruction
Environment in regression
All reverse into decline
Kiss this unfit goodbye
Goodbye!

[Chorus 2]
Silent screams from an unfit Earth
A future of provocation with nowhere to go

 

[Verse 1]
Forced exposure to create what is expected
Neglection is the price no-one wants to pay

[Verse 2]
Line in line, stereotypes perpetrated
Similarity of negativity

[Chorus]
The chains that bind us grow stronger

[Verse 3]
Break away from the pack of mindless dogs
Taste the scent, realise ambition

[Verse 4]
Life, a stagnant lair in which to lie
Taste the scent, realise ambition

[Chorus]
The chains that bind us grow stronger

[Verse 5]
A label to some
Habits preset
Faction alienation
Bias hold the key

 

[Verse 1]
You come to us and criticise
Without prior inspection
Judge us as a waste of time
An incorrect perception

[Verse 2]
Just a noise, your shallow view
An opinion I find misconstrued
There's probably more thought in what we do
Than a large part of what appeals to you

[Verse 3]
Why should we?
Why the need to justify?
Only in others' presence
Are you motivated to jeer and jibe
Everybody has the right to opinionise
But to us your pettiness
Is used to occupy your tiny minds

[Chorus]
Extremity retained
Never fall into your line

 

[Verse 1]
Search for purity
Leads to insecurity
Individuality
An incapability
Trapped within outside theories

[Verse 2]
Ideals adopted
Agreeable on basis
Yet to question
Aspects a cardinal sin
Should self expression
Mean social loss of face
Labelled unaware
Because you beg to differ

[Verse 3]
Hiding behind
A shroud of belief
Staunchly involved
Highly confused
Confidence in your firmly
Lodged thoughts
Yet take a back seat
While others speak for you

[Verse 4]
Should every single
Thinking moment
Be saturated
With political stance
Striving for perfection
Fear of group rejection

[Verse 5]
Better to be at mental ease
Than harbouring
Thoughts not mutually agreed

[Verse 6]
The spoken mind
And reasons why
Dictation by others
Be denied without fail
