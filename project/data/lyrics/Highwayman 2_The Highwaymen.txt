[Verse 1]
I'm gonna steal me a silver stallion
With not a mark upon his silky hide
Teach him he can trust me like a brother
One day we'll saddle up and ride

[Chorus]
And we're gonna ride, we're gonna ride
Ride like the one eyed jack of diamonds
With the devil close behind
We're gonna ride

[Verse 2]
I'm gonna find me a reckless woman
Razor blades and dice in her eyes
Just a touch of sadness in her fingers
Thunder and lightening in her thighs

[Chorus]
And we're gonna ride, we're gonna ride
Ride like the one eyed jack of diamonds
With the devil close behind
We're gonna ride

[Verse 3]
I'm gonna chase the sky forever
With the woman and the stallion and the wind
And the sun is gonna burn into a cinder
Before we ever pass this way again

[Chorus]
And we're gonna ride, we're gonna ride
Ride like the one eyed jack of diamonds
With the devil close behind
We're gonna ride

 

[Waylon Jennings]
The wind blows hard across the Texas plains
Makes some people go insane
While others quietly pray for rain
That's where we came from
Two boys playing in the burning sun
One with books, one with guns
Mama calls but just one comes
[Willie Nelson]
The other one runs

[All]
In a crystal sense of wrong and right
We were born and raised in black and white
One learned to pray, one loved to fight
We were born and raised in black and white
We were born and raised in black and white

[Kris Kristofferson]
Brother took to the gospel road
Spent his whole live saving souls
When he looked at me his blood ran cold
He didn't even try

[Waylon Jennings]
I had no dreams, I had no plans
But a gun felt good in my right hand
The warden asked how come you killed that man
I said I don't know why

[All]
Welcome home said the hot moonlight
We were born and raised in black and white
One lives to pray, one prays for life
We were born and raised in black and white
We were born and raised in black and white

[Waylon Jennings]
Someone handed me a cigarette
They offered me my last request
I asked my mortal soul be blessed
By someone close to me

He came to me with trembling hands
He swore he'd never understand
I said it's just what life had planned
It's destiny

[All]
Don't waste your tears on me tonight
We were born and raised in black and white
I chose the dark, you chased the light
We were born and raised in black and white
We were born and raised in black and white

[Willie Nelson]
The wind blows hard across the Texas plains
Makes some people go insane
[Waylon Jennings]
While others quietly pray for rain

 

Come out of the darkness
Don't hide in the night
Come out in the sunshine
And we'll be all right

Life's too long to worry
And it's too short to cry
And it's too deep to measure
It's two stories wide

There's your side and my side
Which side do you need?
Both sides make you lonely
And make your heart bleed

Life's too long to worry
And it's too short to cry
And it's too deep to measure
It's two stories wide

[Instrumental break.]

Life's too long to worry
And it's too short to cry
It's too deep to measure
But it's two stories wide

Life's too long to worry
It's too short to cry
And it's too deep to measure
And it's two stories wide

 

[Verse 1]
I am a shotgun rider
For the San Jacinto line
The desert is my brother
My skin is cracked and dry
I was riding on a folk coach
And everything was fine
Till we took a shorter road
To save some time
The bandits only fired once
They shot me in the chest
They may have wounded me but
They'll never get the best
Of better men
Cause I'll ride again

[Verse 2]
I am a river gambler
I make a living dealing cards
My clothes are smooth and honest
My heart is cold and hard
I was shuffling for some delta boys
On a boat for New Orleans
I was the greatest shark they'd ever seen
But the captain bumped a sandbar
And an ace fell from my sleeve
They threw me overboard
As I swore I didn't cheat
But I could swim
And I'll ride again

[Chorus]
We are heroes of the homeland, American remains
We live in many faces and answer many names
We will not be forgotten, we won't be left behind
Our memories live on in mortal minds
And poets pens
We'll ride again

[Verse 3]
I am a mid-west farmer
I make a living off the land
I ride a John Deere tractor
I'm a liberated man
But the rain it hasn't fallen
Since the middle of July
And if it don't come soon my crops will die
The bank man says he likes me
But there's nothing he can do
He tells me that he's coming
But the clouds are coming too
He ain't my friend
And I'll ride again

[Verse 4]
I am an American Indian
My tribe is Cherokee
My forefathers loved this land
They left it here for me
But the white man came with boats
And trains and dirty factories
An' poisoned my existence with his deeds
Nature is our mother
We are sucklings at her breast
And he who tries to beat her down
Will lose her to the rest
They'll never win
I'll ride again

[Chorus]

 

[Verse 1]
When his stolen gold has turned to rust
He rides off in a cloud of dust
Looking for a border he can cross
She'll stand by and watch him go
Wondering if he'll ever know
The hurt she's feeling now, and what they've lost

[Chorus]
Angels love bad men. That's how it's always been
They give their whole hearts when they fall
Angels love bad men. That's how it's always been
Love holds their hearts against the wall

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2]
When his corporate day comes to an end
He rides away in his Mercedes Benz
Soon he's lost beneath the neon sky
Outside of town, in their suburban home
She spends another night alone
Wonders what went wrong and wonders why

[Chorus]

 

[Verse]
Hey Babe, do you remember
Back in nineteen sixty-nine?
We gathered round the room
You sang yours and I sang mine

We took turns with the guitar
In the front and center seat
Shel and Kris and Dylan
And a couple off the street
Joni Mitchell cried on "Both Sides Now"

We sang songs that made a difference
And we can again somehow

Everybody knew that this was quite a special night
Graham Nash was nervous in the hot seat, in the light
Joe South was total magic and we all walked in his shoes
Orbison and Rabbitt cried and they rocked the country blues
Mickey Newbury's "San Francisco Mabel Joy"
We sang songs that made a difference

June was pregnant with my boy
Oh, I could make a living
Driving nails or driving trucks
Sleep beneath the bridge
Or in the streets, down on my luck

[Willie Nelson]
I'd stand the cold and hunger
If they'd let me hear the songs
Everybody write one
That us bums can sing along

[Kris Kristofferson]
Keep it from the heart and down to earth
Sing the songs that make a difference
Give us all our money's worth

[Chorus]
Hey, keep it from the heart and down to earth
Sing the songs that make a difference
Give us all our money's worth

 

Listen to my song
And if you want to sing along
It's about where I belong
Texas

Sometimes far into the night
And until the morning light
I pray with all my might
To be in Texas

It's where I want to be
The only place for me
Where my spirit can be free
Texas

It's where I want to be
The only place for me
Where my spirit can be free
Texas

Listen to my song
And if you want to sing along
It's about where I belong
Texas
