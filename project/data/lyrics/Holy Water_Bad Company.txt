In my life, there's been changes
But nothing seems to satisfy me the way you do, no
You make it easy, the way you please me
Everytime I'm close to you

All this temptation, I can't see wrong from right
It's a new sensation, you know I'm blinded by the light

(Feels like) I'm walking on holy water
Feels like I'm walking on sacred ground, baby
(Feels like) I'm walking on holy water, everytime (that) you come 'round

You were all I ever wanted
Never had a girl in my life 'til I met you, no no no
I got a certain feeling, you got my senses reeling
Whenever I get close to you

You're my salvation, I found you just in time
My one temptation, you know I can't believe you're mine

(Feels like) I'm walking on holy water
Feels like I'm walking on sacred ground, baby
(Feels like) I'm walking on holy water, everytime (that) you come 'round

Oh yeah, it's funny how it seems like yesterday
Lovin' of the first degree
One word was all I heard you say, ooh baby
It's funny what you've done to me
Just wanna see you run to me

Yeah, all this temptation, I can't see wrong from right
It's a new sensation, you know I'm blinded by the light

(Feels like) I'm walking on holy water
Feels like I'm walking on sacred ground, baby
(Feels like) I'm walking on holy water, everytime (that) you come 'round

 

I had your picture, I had it there on the wall
It's been a long time, I didn't notice it fall
Just goes to show you, things get strange, there's nothin', nothin' I can do
You got your own life, I got mine, I still got feelings for you

And I wonder what you're thinking, does it ever seem right
Don't you know there's something missing, we don't have to fight
If you call me tonight

I'll be with you in a heartbeat, just whisper my name
And I'll be with you in a heartbeat, no questions, no blame
And I'll be with you in a heartbeat, just whisper my, just whisper my name

I got no answers, sometimes I just wanna shout
Which way to turn now, can't seem to figure this out
I haven't seen you in oh so long, nothin', nothin' seems to fade
Tried to forget you, but you won't go, ooh the memories we made

And I tried so hard to fight it, but it keeps comin' through
Ooh you were all I ever wanted, I'm waiting for you, if you wanted me too

I'll be with you in a heartbeat, just whisper my name
And I'll be with you in a heartbeat, no questions, no blame
And I'll be with you in a heartbeat, just whisper my, just whisper my name

And I wonder what you're thinking, does it ever seem right
Don't you know there's something missing, we don't have to fight
If you call me tonight

I'll be with you in a heartbeat, just whisper my name
And I'll be with you in a heartbeat, no questions, no blame
And I'll be with you in a heartbeat, just whisper my, just whisper my name
