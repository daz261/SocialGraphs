A sea of twisted shapes
Seek salvage from this carnage
Frustration deep inside
Write in utmost rage
A tortuous embrace is embedded in their minds
As hands from above grasp
Emptiness they find

Paralysed from neck down
Like fluid drinks
Pressures increase on flesh
Excruciating pain

These mindless thoughtless fools
Corrupted in mind
Crying out for the death
Innocence they find
The silence looms before us
Free of trouble and strife
While bodies pile in hundreds
Free from the gift of Life

Drown in misery
Deadly Inner Sense
This place of doom
A sacred shrine
Eternal punishment for all time

The deadly inner sense

 

Kneel on the ground and pray to the Lord
But will he hear your prayers
Will he hear your call?
As you sit in the church
And the madman speaks
Listen with awe at the lies he'll preach

Only the mindless will listen and obey
World-wide wars are caused by this uproar

Pray to rest your conscience, for the sins you have done
Where is your God now as you're dying alone?
Brutal wounds cut deep
No miracles to heal
Watch your life now fade
He's not there to help you die

Raised upon repulsive lies
From the time we were born
Driven into heads holy laws
Cast into a circle of preaching vomit
All decent holy people
Their conscience free
Massive neurosis and impending doom
And the holy power will be silent

Only the mindless will listen and obey
World-wide wars are caused by this uproar

Pray to rest your conscience, for the sins you have done
Where is your God now as you're dying alone?
Brutal wounds cut deep
No miracles to heal
Watch your life now fade
He's not there to help you die

Raised upon repulsive lies
From the time we were born
Driven into heads holy laws

 

I lay in the darkest room
The door is locked at chains I grasp
The chill runs through my bones
I panic in grief
Oh please help me die

The walls close in on my existence

Unreal illusions re-appear
Darkness increases still
Frozen Illusion

I lay in the darkest room
As images appear once more
The chill runs through my bones
My body is stiff as my soul departs the earth
