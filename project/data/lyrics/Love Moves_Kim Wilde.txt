There was a lot to make up
For the time we'd had
Cos we'd been lonely far too long
Had enough of feeling sad
And no, it didn't take long
To right all the wrong
And hurt inside
And now I can't believe what's happening
Right before my eyes

Just look at the rain falling
Look at the thunder
Look at the storm in your hearts
Look at the waves crashing
Pulling us under
Helplessly lost in the dark

We could have lost so easily
And let it go
We had no reason to believe
That love was just about to grow
And we got given a chance
I'm so proud we didn't throw it away
Cos broken hearts lie on the pavement
You see them every day

Just look at the rain falling
Look at the thunder
Look at the thunder
Look at the storm in your hearts
Look at the waves crashing
Pulling us under
Helplessly lost in the dark
In the dark

Just look at the rain falling
Look at the thunder
Look at the storm in your hearts
Look at the waves crashing
Pulling us under
Helplessly lost in the dark

Look at the rain
Look at the thunder
Look at the storm
In our hearts
In our hearts

 

Let's think of the good things
Instead of all the bad
We mustn't give into
A world that's going mad
So hold on, we can survive
We've got to keep the spirit
Of destiny alive
Just say that we can if we try

Like the rivers need the mountains
Just like the flowers need the rain
Pleasure need the pain
However far away it seems
I'm dreaming for a world
In perfect harmony

And we've got to face it
There's nowhere left to hide
(but we need) a determination
To change the wrong to right
The future's a baby born
Looking for us for strength
To keep it from harm
You know we'll succeed if we try

Like the rivers need the mountains
Just like flowers need the rain
Pleasure need the pain
How ever far away it seems
I'm dreaming for a world
In perfect harmony

Don't let your dreams escape
The future's ours to shape

 

Do you remember when tears fell like rain
When hearts got broken again and again
The disillusionment after the pain
Seems everything stays the same

But time goes by and you've further to fall
You build your life like you're building a wall
Then it surrounds you, and though you may call
You're voice is so small

And all your expectations of how life should be
Have needed correction
There is no perfection but

Someday maybe you'll stop living
In a world of fantasy
Someday open up your mind and see
Live in a reality

Life's in your hands but you're closing your mind
Cos you're afraid of the mess you will find
You're scared that's love gonna leave you behind
That you're running out of time

And all your expectations of how life should be
Have needed correction
There is no perfection
But

Someday maybe you'll stop living
In a world of fantasy
One day open up your mind and see
Live in a reality
Someday maybe you'll stop looking
For a world of make believe
One day open up your eyes ans see
Make it a reality

Stop crying
Looking at life through bitter tears
And face your fears
To reveal the thruth inside
Just like a child

Someday maybe you'll stop living
In a world of fantasy
One day open up your mind and see
Live in a reality
Maybe you'll stop looking
For a world of make believe
Someday open up your eyes and see
Make it a reality

Someday...
Someday...

 

They say that love is a dangerous thing
And hits your heart like a revolution
And all the pain it can bring
Will only lead to confusion
But now that love has come into my life
We'll I've discovered a different meaning
And there's no danger at all
It's just a beautiful feeling

I konw it's wrong to keep it inside for so long
When we both could see it coming
It was just a matter of time

Time
Falling in love with you was just a matter of time
Falling in love with you

It seems so long ago we were just friends
Different people with different faces
Just getting on with our lives
Isn't it funny how fate is
But I know it's right the way that we're feeling tonight
Cos we both could feel it coming
It was just a matter of time

Time
Falling in love with you was just a matter of time
Baby, I knew with you it was just a matter of time

Something so good was worth waiting for
Now it's easy to say that I love you
When you're feeling it too
Cos we knew in our hearts
That is was just a matter of time
Falling in love with you
