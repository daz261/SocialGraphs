Cheese is the one thing that's indestructible
How much is your Blue Cross deductible?
Open your eyes to a wicked surprise
You'll lose your mind if you just step inside
They say even Bambi was corruptible
The flu's coming, yes are you susceptible?
If only traces of lead were detectable
Open your brain to a new kind of pain
Just step inside and we'll all go insane
Please put your thoughts inside a receptacle

You are not one of us
Your pipes are leaking
You are an ocelot
But what are you seeking?

Baboons, they say, are quite understanding
Ships without rudders aren't worth commanding
Open your skull to a world that is dull
You'll find it all when you shop at the mall
People like you are not worth reprimanding

I think you need some help
I think that you're way off course
Maybe you need a little breather
You should get down off that horse

Look up into the sky
Try to catch your racing thoughts
Before they burn up in the sun
Take a walk
Sit in your rocking chair and breathe...
Just breathe
And breathe
Just breathe
Welcome to your head
Trippin' on Wonder Bread
Welcome to your head!

Peer into the endless void
And see the endless light
Realize there is no time
There is only light

Feel the heat of the moment
Feel the heat of the now
Feel the heat of the beige sunshine
In the back of your mind, and breathe...
Just breathe
And breathe
Let's breathe

 

Dean: Hey there's a big airplane goin' by
Rodney: Get it! Go! Go!
Some Recording Guy: It's on the track
Rodney: Leave it! Get it on the track!
Joe: Get it! Get it! Catch it!
Dean: I got it :)

You've got a Methodist coloring book
And you color really well
But don't color outside the lines
Or God will send you to Hell
'Cause God hates war
And God hates crime
A' but he really hates people
Who color outside the lines

You've got a Methodist coloring book
Don't color outside the lines
'Cause if God doesn't strike you with lightning
He'll at least make you go blind
Good people get sent to the attic
Bad people will roast in the cellar
But there's a special kind a' Hell
For those who just won't learn to color

God is gracious, God is good
So let's color in his book
God wears cotton, God wears rayon
He can mend a broken crayon
God is honest, He don't take payola
Let's all thank him for our Crayolas!

You got a Methodist coloring book! (x3)
(ah..oh..oh) (x2)
You got a Methodist coloring book! (x3)
(oh..oh..oh.. (a very emotional performance))

You've got a Methodist coloring book
And you color really well
But don't color out side the lines
Or God will send you to Hell

Now, you talk about that Bohagus boy. You know him, Billy Bohagus? They
Found him last week out behind the barn (dramatic pause) with his math
Teacher, his Scout leader, and the local minister, and that boy had the
Nerve to say it was part of a biology project. We killed him; had no
Other choice

Part 3
-------------

I saw you naked, you were chasin' a pig
So I led the police to your house and showed 'em where to dig
You thought you could live in peace
But I saw you naked and I called the police

I saw you naked and I saw the terrible things that you did
I saw you naked and you know it made me sick

I saw you naked, you were campin' with scouts
I know they earned some merit badges when the lights went out
How could you touch those children?
I saw you naked, you were holdin' a trout

I saw you naked and I saw the terrible things that you did
I saw you naked and you know it made me sick

Don't you kids try this solo at home
That man is a trained professional

I saw you naked, you were up in a tree
Were you gonna jump on the paper boy? I hadda wait and see
Were you afraid of squirrels? Poison Ivy?
I saw you naked, you were singin' "Born Free"
"Born Free"

I saw you naked and I saw the terrible things that you did
I saw you naked and you know it made me sick
