[Verse 1]
Ain't no fun at the government hall
Slicked back injustice sits nicely next to smiles
Paranoia at the heels of too much greed
Obedience an art form while the sad bleed

[Chorus]
Success and love dictate while skin touches fashion
Consumerism beauty for cheap appeal
I don't wanna dance for people to watch
Smother my life in interest accounts

[Verse 2]
Outside life brings down genocide
And consumer self-hate leads to designer bullshit
Hate is art and we steal cars
Decaying flowers in the playground of the rich

[Chorus]
You can launch sweetly and say nice things
But I ain't ever on the way up
My only way is down on disease that tries to suffocate
The pure ideals that turn to hate

Strip it down
