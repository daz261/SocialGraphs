Uh-oh, uh-oh uh-oh uh-oh
Uh-oh, uh-oh (Here comes the Hammer!)
Uh-oh, uh-oh uh-oh uh-oh
Uh-oh, uh-oh (Here comes the Hammer!)

[MC Hammer]
Yes, this is a mission, that I'm on
Takin out the weak on the microphone
I'm hype -- so don't talk
About the hard hittin Hammer, when you can't even walk
On the STAGE -- after me
And if you do, yo, a catastrophe
Happens -- just like that
I rock 'em all from white to black
OH, OH, OH - BUST IT!

[Hook]

[Dance interlude]
Hoooo, hoooo, hoooo
Hoooo, hoooo, hoooo
Hoooo, hoooo, hoooo
Hoooo, hoooo, hoooo

[MC Hammer]
"Naw, NAW!" -- is what I said
When I came to see a show
I looked and it was dead, DEAD!! -- y'know!
Like a body in the ground, will your show ever grow?
Let me know -- if not
Then close yo' mouth because you sho' ain't hot
It needs WORK! -- like a car in a wreck
They call me Hammer, you gotta earn my respect
OH, OH, OH - Yeah!

BUST IT! - I don't hesitate -- or wait
Before the bell rings, I'm out the gate
And rollin, out for mine
Workin so hard for such a long time
In life, it's here and gone
So (PEDAL TO THE HAMMER) while I'm watchin the throne
Not a king, just feelin hype
You dance to the music while I'm on the mic
OH, OH, OH - Here we go!

BUST IT! - A minute or two, now I'm rollin
A whole new style that the people are holdin
ON -- TO
I move, I groove, I rap, you're through
You're so plain -- just plain
Your ego so big, that you missed the whole train
A-GAIN, my friend
The people wanted more, that's why the Hammer's in
OH, OH, OH - Yeah!

[Hook w/ dance interlude]

You came to get wit it and this is your night
YEAH! - Let 'em know
The cool, the hard, the fly (HOOOOOO!)

Hammer's in the speaker and you know the bass is bumpin
LOUD!! -- and low
It's about that time so here we go
OH, OH, OH - BUST IT!

Ah yeah, I'm glad I put this tape in
I'm just gon' cruise down the road
Look at the stars in the sky
And drift off into the sweet memories that I have
Of a love that my heart has been searching for
For so long, and I know somewhere
If I keep looking, that love I'll find
The picture grows clearer and clearer
From the back to the front of my mind
And like love, a love I know I'll have
The girl that I want, she'll be mine, she'll be fly, and it'll last

I see her face and I can't let go
She's in my dreams and my heart, so let me know
(Have you seen her?)
Have you seen her?
(Tell me have you seen her?)
I'm looking for that love
She's a thought and a vision in my memory
I haven't met her, but tell me where could she be
(Have you seen her?)
Have you seen her?
(Tell me have you seen her?)
I'm looking for that special love
(Love, oh love, love is a feeling that I need)
Love is a feeling that the Hammer definitely needs
(Please be mine)
Baby be mine
(I need your love to make it)
I need your love to make it
So why don't you be mine
The search is going on
From coast to coast
A women for the man, who's propping the most
(Have you seen her?)
Have you seen her?
(Tell me have you seen her?)
My heart is beating strong
This love cannot be wrong
I need her and I want her, so come on to my home
(Have you seen her?)
Have you seen her?
(Tell me have you seen her?)
I'm a keep looking
At the movies, in my car, on my stereo
At a game of Different World or the Cosby Show
(Have you seen her?)
Have you seen her?
(Tell me have you seen her?)
Yo Bill, tell me what's up
At the track, at the club, or out buying dub
If you've seen her, then I'll have her, cause I'm in love
(Have you seen her?)
Have you seen her?
(Tell me have you seen her?)
My heart is hurting so bad
(Love, oh love, love is a feeling that I need)
Love is a feeling that I know I need
(Please be mine)
Be mine baby
(I need your love to make it)
I need your love to make it
Why don't you be mine
(Baby, be mine)
Where could she be?
At the store around the corner
Or wondering at night
Or chilling with another brother holding the mic
(Have you seen her?)
Have you seen her?
(Tell me have you seen her?)
Hammer, you know I'm looking
Calling all my friends all around the place
Guy, Levert, or my homey Rob Base
(Have you seen her?)
Have you seen her?
(Tell me have you seen her?)
If you've peeped her out, tell me
Yo, veo on the phone
Ted, Dre, or Ed Lover
Fab Five, homeys won't you help a young brother
(Have you seen her?)
Have you seen her?
(Tell me have you seen her?)
I got a picture in my mind
The thought is so clear of the love I need here
Like D-B magic, and why don't you appear
(Have you seen her?)
Oh baby, why don't you appear
(Tell me have you seen her?)
I can see yo' face
I'm seeing her face, again and again
Come knocking at my door, and you know I'll let you in
(Have you seen her?)
Have you seen her?
(Tell me have you seen her?)
Oh, my sweet love
Searching 'round the world, what more can I say?
The girl is hard to see like an unseen VJ
(Have you seen her? Tell me have you seen her? Have you seen her?)

 

Ain't it funny that the way you feel, shows on your face
And no matter, how you try to hide it'll state your case
Now a frown will bring your sprits down to the ground
And never let you see, the good things all around
Everytime we seem to let our feelings flow
Our luck run out and the wind won't blow

But that can't make me sad, just can't make me
Whoa, 'cause I've been there before, don't wanna go no more
The world can't take me, won't let it drive me mad
Sadness bears no remedy for the problems in your life
While you run your race, keep a smilin' face
Help you set your pace

Wish upon a sunny day, it'll turn to rain
Use the sunshine in your heart to ease the pain
We wonder how your attitude is going down
Is it wakin' and shakin' and safe and sound'
Every time we seem to let our feelings flow
Our luck runs out and the wind won't blow

But that can't make me sad, that can't make me
Whoa, 'cause I've been there before, don't wanna go no more
The world can't take me, won't let it drive me mad
Sadness bears no remedy for the problems in your life
While you run your race, keep a smilin' face
Life is on your case

Yes it is, yeah
This world can't shake me, bad times can't make me sad
Whoa, 'cause I've been there before, don't wanna go no more
The world can't take me, won't let it drive me mad

You can't shake me the way I feel today
Come tomorrow I'll feel the same ol' way
Ain't it funny that the way you feel shows on your face?
Wake me! My heart is feelin' glad
I'll take you with me when you're feelin' bad
Use the sunshine in your heart

You can't shake me the way I feel today
Come tomorrow I'll feel the same ol' way
I start to wonder what's going down, gotta feel it, feel it
Wake me! My heart is feeling glad
I'll take you with me when you're feelin' bad

I start to wonder what's going down
In your life, is it safe and sound'
I start to wonder if your life's all right
Are you dealing with it everyday or does it cause you strife?
Yeah

 

Brothers and sisters
The pride is back

Black is black
I'm black and I'm proud
You can't take that
Don't want to
Say it loud
Black is black
Brothers and sisters
So we brought it back
