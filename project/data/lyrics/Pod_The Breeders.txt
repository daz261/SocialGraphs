[Intro]
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da

[Verse 1]
Ah-ah, hold my breath for three more year
Yeah, three years
On my own on Saturdays, ah-ah

[Refrain]
It's glorious
It's glorious

[Verse 2]
We were tired from the tea, ah-ah
Scrabbled and we slept
Through the window came the rain, ah-ah

[Refrain]
It's glorious
It's glorious
It's glorious
It's glorious
It's glorious
It's glorious

[Verse 3]
Being tired from the tea, ah-ah
Hold my breath for three more year
Yeah, three years
On my own on Saturdays, ah-ah

[Refrain]
It's glorious
It's glorious
It's glorious
It's glorious

 

[Verse 1]
She's not a girl who misses much
Do-do-do-do-do, oh, yeah
She's well acquainted with the touch of a velvet hand
Like a lizard on a window pane
The man in the crowd with the multicoloured mirrors
On his hobnail boots
Lying with his eyes, while his hands are busy
Working overtime
The soap impression of his wife
Which he ate and donated to the National Trust

[Verse 2]
I need a fix 'cause I'm going down
Down to the bits that I've left uptown
I need a fix 'cause I'm going down

[Pre-Chorus]
Mother Superior, jump the gun
Mother Superior, jump the gun
Mother Superior, jump the gun
Mother Superior, jump the gun
Mother Superior, jump the gun (Oh!)
Mother Superior, jump the gun

[Chorus]
Happiness is a warm gun
Happiness is a warm gun
Happiness is a warm gun
(Bang, bang, shoot, shoot)
Happiness is a warm gun
(Bang, bang, shoot, shoot)

[Spoken Outro: Britt Walford, Josephine Wiggs]
Josephine, do you think you are going bald?
No, you've asked me that before
And the answer was no then

 

[Verse 1]
It lives
In folds of red and steamy air
It lives
In misery

[Chorus]
Hellbound, hellbound
(Hellbound, hellbound)
Hellbound, hellbound
(Hellbound, hellbound)
Hellbound, hellbound
(Hellbound, hellbound)

Oh, oh we're falling
Falling down
Down, d-down, d-down

[Verse 2]
It lives
Despite the knives internal
It lives
Marry me

[Chorus]
Hellbound, hellbound
(Hellbound, hellbound)
Hellbound, hellbound
(Hellbound, hellbound)
Hellbound, hellbound
(Hellbound, hellbound)

Oh, oh we're falling
Falling down
Down, d-down, d-down
Down, d-down, d-down
Down, d-down, d-down

[Verse 3]
It lives
In misery

[Chorus]
Hellbound, hellbound
(Hellbound, hellbound)
Hellbound, hellbound
(Hellbound, hellbound)
Hellbound, hellbound
(Hellbound, hellbound)
Hellbound, hellbound
(Hellbound, hellbound)
Hellbound, hellbound
(Hellbound, hellbound)
Hellbound, hellbound
Hellbound, hellbound
Hellbound, hellbound
Hellbound, hellbound

 

[Verse 1]
Inside legs of corduroy I've been
Heard stories of bare velveteen
Twenty hours later, I fill the room
With bad sex and bad TV

[Refrain]
Go, go, go
Go, go, go

[Verse 2]
When I was a painter, I painted you well
Too bad I have to die
You brought the essentials, perversion appeal
And many lovers at one time

[Refrain]
Go, go, go
Go, go, go
On and on

[Verse 3]
Inside legs of corduroy I've been
Heard stories of bare velveteen
Twenty hours later, I fill the room
With bad sex and bad TV

[Refrain]
Go, go, go
Go, go, go

 

[Verse 1]
Four hours in the pod, one hour out
It grows and I sleep standing up
When Iris sleeps over
What a book she'll write

[Pre-Chorus]
Stay for the last time
Oh come on, nobody wants that
Sister, sister
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
We tried hour by hour
Hour by hour
Hour by hour

[Verse 2]
Four hours to daylight, four hours and then
Pour water on me 'til I live again
When Iris sleeps over
It'll be alright

[Pre-Chorus]
All last night
But come on, nobody wants that
Sister, sister
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
We tried hour by hour
Hour by hour
Hour by hour

 

[Verse 1]
Walking on these highways
We leave the land
And float inside the dark, black water

[Refrain]
Robin flies again
Robin flies again

[Verse 2]
She flew low over the highways
And I saw the wind
Blowing back her barbie doll hair

[Refrain]
Robin flies again
Robin flies again

[Verse 3]
And in a kitchen in Kentucky
She thinks she's Peter Pan
And in the bottom of a concrete basement

[Refrain]
Robin flies again
Robin flies again
