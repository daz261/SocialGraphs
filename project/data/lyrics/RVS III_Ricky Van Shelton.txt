Somewhere there should be
For all the world to see
A statue of a fool made of stone
The image of a man
Who let love slip through his hands
And then just let him stand there all alone

And there on his face
A gold tear should be placed
To honor the million tears he's cried
And the hurt in his eyes would show
So everyone would know
That concealed is a broken heart inside

So build me a statue and, Lord, build it high
So that all can see
Then inscribe "the world's greatest fool"
And name it after me
After me

 

Please, there's no need for any thank you's
For loving you so faithfully
From the moment that we met
Something in me said that you would do the same for me

When we walked down the aisle of the chapel
And I promised my love would always be
When I looked into your eyes
It was then I realized, that you would do the same for me

Together through the years of laughter and tears
I have kept that promise honestly
When temptation came along, I was able to be strong
Knowing you would do the same for me

If anyone should ask me why I will love you 'til I die
I'll say you would do the same for me
I'll just say you would do the same for me

 

Pretty woman, walking down the street
Pretty woman, the kind I'd like to meet
Pretty woman, I don't believe you
You're not the truth
No one could look as good as you
Mercy

Pretty woman, won't you pardon me
Pretty woman, I couldn't help but see
Pretty woman, that you look lovely as can be
Are you lonely just like me
Grrrrrrowl

Pretty woman, stop awhile
Pretty woman, talk awhile
Pretty woman, give your smile to me
Pretty woman, yeah, yeah, yeah
Pretty woman, look my way
Pretty woman, say you'll stay with me

Cause I need you, I'll treat you right
Come with me baby, be mine tonight

Pretty woman, don't walk on by
Pretty woman, don't make me cry
Pretty woman, don't walk away
Hey, okay

If that's the way it must be, okay
I guess I'll go on home, it's late
There'll be tomorrow night, but wait
What do I see
Is she walking back to me
Yeah, she's walking back to me
Oh, oh, pretty woman
