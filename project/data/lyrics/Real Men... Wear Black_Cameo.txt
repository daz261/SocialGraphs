Ow, ow, yeah

Baby, I like this feeling
You've got my heart still reeling
'Round and 'round you
You sexy thing you
You always know just what to do

Oh, I've had many girls before
I was a Don Juan, that's for sure
But I'm ready for the serious thing now
And I know you've got that thing for me

Baby
(Baby, I want your love, I need it)
Baby
(Baby, I want your love, I see it)
Baby
(Baby, I want your love, don't hide it)

There's nothing that could do
To work this body quite like you

Baby, I've been waiting such a long time
I want it now and you want it too
Baby, I've been waiting
Such a real long time now
I want it now and you want it too

Girl, I've been as patient as I can be
I get excuses and you hide from me
Baby, I won't let you know
Without your love, where can I go?

I'm not an easy quitter
(Oh, no)
It only makes me come and get it
With you, on a serious tip
I'm busting out, what you've done for me

Baby
(Baby, I want your love, I need it)
Baby
(Baby, I want your love, I see it)
Baby
(Baby, I want your love, don't hide it)

There's nothing that could do to work
This body quite like you

Baby, I've been waiting such a long time
I want it now and you want it too
Baby, I've been waiting
Such a real long time now

I want it now
(I want it now)
And you want it too
(Ow)

Baby, I want it now
I've been waiting such a long time
(Baby)
I want it now and you want it too

Baby, I want your love, I need it
Baby, I want your love, I see it
Baby, I want your love, don't hide it
There's nothing that could do to work
This body quite like you

Baby, I've been waiting such a long time
I want it now and you want it too
Baby, I've been waiting
Such a real long time now

I want it now
(I want it now)
And you want it too

I want it now and you want it too
