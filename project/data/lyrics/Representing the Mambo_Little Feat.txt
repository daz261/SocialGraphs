The siren song is strong sometimes... on this Texas radio
They sure do play it hard and fast while they sell it soft and low
A silky voice she spoke to me from down in San Antone
"It's ladies night in Italy, you gentlemen should know"

When I saw that neon sign, knew just where to go
Her shoulders soft so I pulled off, her headlights aglow
A bartender said to me, boy I want you to meet my sister
She's high-strung and a little young, but she's a real Texas twister
A real Texas twister

I said "How young is too young? How fast is too fast?
Well how high is too high? How high is too high?"
She said "How long is this ride?" Well how long can you last?
You're gonna find out mister, when you meet that Texas twister

Well in the light she looked all right when we stepped outside
I knew that it was meant to be when she begged me for a ride
That bartender said to me, boy take your money back
Before you're done you're gonna need it son --
You might have a heart attack

I seen the sights now, Paris, Rome, and I ain't sentimental
I still remember how she said "Is this a Continental?"
No babe it's just for flash and I paid cash, she hugged me up real tight
Lay back honey I'll drive you home 'round the world tonight

She knew where every roadhouse lies, clear down to the border
Long neck Lone Stars just her size, clearly made to order
Knew how to paint a cowboy town, long before I missed her
She picked me up; she put me down, she's a real Texas twister

I said "How young is too young? How fast is too fast?
Well how high is too high? How high is too high?"
She said "How long is this ride?" Well how long can you last?
You're gonna find out mister, when you meet that Texas twister

Well she's the kind of girl that you dream about
Got the big blue eyes that'll knock you out
Got a hand on your wallet, and a smil on her face
And a heavenly voice, that says let's go to my place

Well she knows what she wants... she's a woman in love
And she wants what she knows... she's a woman in love
A whole lotta money, and a passel of clothes
No one got to tell ya... she's a woman in love

She's about as hot as a smokin' gun
A Saturday night special, she packin' plenty of fun
She got me sweatin' bullets on a cold Winter night
I got one in the chamber with the safety off
You know I feel all right

Well she knows what she wants... she's a woman in love
And she wants what she knows... she's a woman in love
A diamond necklace and a string of pearls
No one got to tell ya... she's a woman in love

She's a hard workin' girl, spends her days on her feet
She got the pulse of the office, never skips a beat
But don't you know it's a shame, yeah it ain't fair
She works twice as hard as the boys upstairs
She put in more hours for half the wage
Ain't no wonder this girl's in a rage

Well she knows what she wants... she's a woman in love
And she wants what she knows... she's a woman in love
A whole lotta money, and a passel of clothes
No one got to tell ya... she's a woman in love

Well she knows what she wants... she's a woman in love
And she wants what she knows... she's a woman in love
A diamond necklace and a string of pearls
No one got to tell ya... she's a woman in love

If you walk in right off the street
You can take the load right off your feet
Mamma bring the menu to your seat
But the bill of fare be short and sweet
Won't find no etouffe'
Mamma never ever could cook that way
She's all ancien' regime
No nouvell cuisine

She cook gumbo
A mighty Rad Gumbo
It's the only way she can go
Down at the Club Rad Gumbo

Now the heads and shells stay in the stock
She stirs her roux and really rocks
One gallon shellfish stock or water
Man this gumbo is made to order
Two toes of garlic finely chopped
Man this party just can't be stopped
Mamma's pots are boiling, the band starts to blow
Piano keys flying like Fats Domino

She cook gumbo
A mighty Rad Gumbo
It's the only way she can go
Down at the Club Rad Gumbo

Oh no, no escargot, no cordon bleu
This ain't the place to go lookin' for beef stew
But if you like tender shrimp and rice
If ya think ya can stand the spice

She cook gumbo
A mighty Rad Gumbo

Now people comin' from miles around
To see what Mamma's puttin' down
Everybody knows her name
She in the seafood hall of fame
I gotta get that recipe
If it means the death of me
Get my spyboy to sneak a look
Into Mamma's book

She cook gumbo
A mighty Rad Gumbo
It's the only way she can go
Down at the Club Rad Gumbo

She cook gumbo
A mighty Rad Gumbo
It's the only way she can go
Down at the Club Rad Gumbo

Gettin' it while you can
Before the fascination goes
Down to the very last man
Where it stops nobody knows

Nothin to hold you back when the feelin's right
Hidin' from the day and waitin' for the night
It's just a pretty hard thing
To keep gettin' back up after being knocked down

Ain't no backin' down
Ain't no turnin' of the other cheek
The rules of the rest of the town
Ain't the same ones out here on the street
Lookin' for anything that'll make your emotions stir
Like walkin' the street with some tight-skirt sister
It's just a pretty hard thing
To keep gettin' back up after being knocked down

I'm caught in a crossfire
Of a hopeless disillusion
Nothin' but chain link and barbed wire
Defining the confusion

Ain't really enough to hold back the winter wind
Really don't know if it's keppin you out or it's keepin' me in
It's just a pretty hard thing
To keep gettin' back up after being knocked down
It's just a pretty hard thing, A pretty tough town
Ya keep gettin' back up after being knocked down
It's just a pretty hard thing, a pretty tough town
