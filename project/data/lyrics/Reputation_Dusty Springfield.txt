What is this strange elation?
Taking my train of thought to an unknown destination
And suddenly I don't know where I am
But like a tremor or a spark
Something's happening in my heart

I've been arrested by you
Take me in, oh, oh, oh
Finally captured by you, by you and by you
Take me in
I've been arrested by you
Take me in, oh, oh, oh
Finally captured by you, by you and by you
Take me in

You've broken my concentration
Saving me just in time from a desperate situation
And suddenly, I don't know who I am
But my dilemma's where to start
Something's happening in my heart

I've been arrested by you
Take me in, oh, oh, oh
Finally captured by you, by you and by you
Take me in
I've been arrested by you
Take me in, oh, oh, oh
Finally captured by you, by you and by you
Take me in

I've been arrested by you
Take me in, oh, oh, oh
Finally captured by you, by you and by you
Take me in
I've been arrested by you
Take me in, oh
Finally captured by you, oh, oh
Take me in
I've been captured, captured, captured, captured
Oh, baby
Oh, ho
Take me baby
Oh, oh, oh, oh

 

Loneliness can lock you up
Like prison walls around your heart
You waste away, you fall apart
The seconds tick away and the world is turning
So take me in your arms while the need is burning, baby

Time, time waits for no-one
Especially me, baby - don't know about you, oh
Time, time, time waits for no-one
So what about it - do you wanna run away with me?

Your tender words release my soul
You move so strong, you've got to know
Your eyes reveal that maybe we should try
The walls won't come down unless you open fire
We gotta make a move 'cause you can't deny it, baby

Time, time waits for no-one
Especially me, baby - don't know about you, oh
Time, time, time waits for no-one
So what about it - do you wanna run away, run away, run away?

You can run from me, but you can't run from yourself
You'd only lose what you really want to love
(It's a sad, sad story), it's always the same
If you don't take chances, there's nothing to gain
Run away, run away

The walls won't come down unless you open fire
We gotta make a move - can't deny it

Time, time waits for no-one, oh, oh
Especially me, baby - don't know about you, oh
Time, time, time waits for no-one
So what about it - do you wanna run away, run away, run away?

Take me in your arms
(Time time) waits for no-one, ooh
So what about it - do you wanna run away, run away, run away?
Time

 

[Verse 1]
Take your time and tell me
Where you lie
I realise
That we've been found out this time

[Verse 2]
We should stay together
If we can
But what you've planned
Means there's a difference between

[Chorus]
What you're gonna say
In private
You still want my love
We're in this together
And what you're gonna do
In public
Say you were never in love
That you can remember

[Verse 3]
So discreet
I never tried to meet
Your friends or interfere
I took a back seat between

[Chorus]
And what you gonna say
In private?
You still want my love
We're in this together
And what you're gonna do
In public
Say you were never in love
That you can remember

[Bridge]
What you gonna say, ay
When you run back to your wife?
I guess it's just the story of my life
What you gonna say?

[Verse 4]
So take your time
And tell me
Where did you learn
Oh, I may publicise
That there's a difference between

[Chorus]
What you're gonna say
In private?
You still want my love
We're in this together
And what you're gonna do
In public
Say you were never in love
That you can remember
Tell me what you gonna say
In private?, ooh, ooh, ooh
You still want my love
We're in this together
What you gonna say
What you gonna do
And what you're gonna do
In public
Say you were never in love
That you can remember

 

Hey boy, don't be shy
Waiting all alone
Think about what you can give
Some boys never learn
That's the way to live
And it's the secret
To getting it right

Living carefully, always filled with doubt
Scared to make a move too soon
Just once, take a chance
She will take one, too
'Cause that's the secret
To getting it right

It's not who loves you as how much do you love
And what's in your heart that shows what you're made of
You're made of love, hey, boy
It's all right
Someone understands
You don't have so far to go
Reach out for her hand
Then you'll really know
The secret to getting it right

You're made of love, hey, boy
It's all right
Someone understands
You don't have so far to go
Reach out for her hand
Then you'll really know
The secret to getting it right

Reach out, take her hand
Then you'll really know
You'll know that you're getting it right
Yes, you'll know that you're getting it right
