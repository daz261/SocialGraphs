[Intro]
Do you know what I'm singing?

[Verse 1]
Oh, yeah
Clean as a whistle
Smellin' like a rose
She got her dirty little finger
Bloodshot eyes are gone
You wanna tell me that I'm wrong

[Chorus]
Twice as hard
As it was the first time
I said goodbye
Twice as hard (One time, baby, two time)
First time, I said goodbye

[Post-Chorus]
Nobody ever wanna know
Love ain't funny
It's a crime in the wink of an eye

[Verse 2]
Oh, yeah
Your sister always singing
She plays the step child
A broken little memory
I was never kind
Are you the one to tell me I'm blind?

[Chorus]
Twice as hard
As it was the first time
I said goodbye
Twice as hard (Two time)
As it was the first time
I said goodbye

[Post-Chorus]
Nobody ever wanna know
Love ain't funny
It's a crime in the wink of an eye

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, bloodshot eyes are gone
And you think you're the one to tell me I'm wrong

[Chorus]
Twice as hard
As it was the first time
I said goodbye
Twice as hard
As it was the first time
I said goodbye
(Twice, baby) Twice as hard
As it was the first time
I said goodbye
Twice as hard
As it was the first time
Bye

[Outro]
So you did come to have a good time
This next selection is one off our album
And it is entitled could I, could I, could I, "Could I've Been So Blind"

 

Cheat the odds that made you
Brave to try to gamble at times
Well, I feel like dirty laundry
Sending sickness on down the line

Tell you why, 'cause I'm jealous, jealous again
Thought it time I let you in
Yeah, I'm jealous, jealous again
Got no time, baby

Always drunk on Sunday
Trying to feel like I'm at home
Smell the gasoline burning
Boys out feeling nervous and cold, oh yeah

I'm jealous, jealous again
Thought it time I let you in
Jealous, jealous again
Got no time, baby

Stop, understand me
I ain't afraid of losing face
Stop, understand me
I ain't afraid of ever losing faith in you

Never felt like smiling
Sugar wanna kill me yet, eh yeah
Find me loose lipped and laughing
Singing songs ain't got no regret, oh yeah

I'm jealous, jealous again
Thought it time I let you in
Jealous, yeah, I'm jealous again
Got no time, baby

Stop, understand me
I ain't afraid of losing face
Stop, understand me
I ain't afraid of ever losing faith in you

Don't you think I want to, don't you think I would
Don't you think I'd tell you baby, if I only could
Am I acting crazy? Am I just too proud?
Am I just plain lazy, am I, am I, am I, am I

Jealous, jealous again
Thought it time that I let you in
Jealous, jealous again
Got no time to let you in

Oh yeah, I'm jealous, jealous again
Got no time now to let you in
Jealous, yeah, jealous again
Got no time, baby, oh yeah

 

[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
Worried sick, my eyes are hurting
To rest, rest my head, I'll take a life
'Cause you know that outside, the girls are dancing
And when you're down, it don't ever, ever seem right

[Verse 2]
Feeling second fiddle to a dead man
I've had it up to my neck with some people's disregard
And like a beat dog, baby, that's walking right outside down Peachtree
No one ever wants to hear it, hear it when you're down

[Chorus]
Sister luck is screaming out
Somebody else's name
Sister luck, oh, got to scream out
Somebody else's name, oh, that's a shame

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
A flip of a coin
Might make a head turn
But there's no, there's no surprise, baby, who can sleep
But you held my hand right over a candle
Flame on it burnt me, I never did weep

[Chorus]
Sister luck is screaming out
Somebody else, ooh, somebody else's name
Sister luck, yeah, got to scream out
Oh, somebody, somebody else's name, imagine

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Sister luck, oh, got to scream out, baby
Somebody else, somebody, somebody else's name
Sister luck, oh, got to scream out
Oh, no, no, no
Somebody else's name and that's a shame

[Outro]
You wanna hear 'bout shame?
You wanna hear about shame, baby?
Babe, I wanna tell 'em, tell 'em 'bout
Thank you so much

 

Under the weather
I never got better
Wrapped up in my disease
Mile away, she want to count my day
Look a little older in the light

Under the weather
Feelin' very heavy
Never up for no air

Sea legs start to wigglin'
And sick I'm still feelin'
Just know I never cared

Don't you want to feel it
Don't you want to stare it cold

Don't you want to feel it
Don't you want to stare it cold

Never thought about it
And never no questions
Seein' where I've gone wrong

No kiss made it magic
'Cause that old girl has had it
Then it's time for me to run along

(Repeat Chorus 4 times)

(Repeat verse 1)

(Repeat Chorus 4 times)

 

[Intro]
Alright, alright, alright, alright
Oh, yeah

[Verse 1]
Chicago Green
Talkin' 'bout red Lebanese
A dirty room and a silver coke spoon
Give me my release, come on
Black Nepalese
It got you weak in your knees
Seeds and dust that you got bust on
You know it's hard to believe

[Chorus]
Thirty days in the hole
Thirty days in the hole
Thirty days in the hole
Thirty days in the hole

[Verse 2]
Newcastle Brown
I'm tellin' ya, it can sure smack you down
Take a greasy whore and a rollin' dance floor
Got your head spinnin' 'round
If you live on the road
Well, there's a nеw highway code
Take some urban noisе with some Durban poison
It's gonna lessen your load

[Chorus]
Thirty days in the hole
Thirty days in the hole
Thirty days in the hole
Thirty days

[Bridge]
Oh, how you doin' boy?
You're here for thirty days
G-g-g-g-get your long hair cuttin'
Cut out them ways

[Verse 3]
Black Nepalese
It got you weak in your knees
Take some seeds and dust that you got bust on
Know it's hard to believe
Newcastle Brown
Tellin' it can sure smack you down
Take a greasy whore and a rollin' dance floor
You know you're jailhouse-bound

[Outro]
Thirty days in the hole (Yeah, alright, alright)
Thirty days in the hole (Yeah)
Thirty days in the hole (No, that's what they're given ya)
Thirty days in the hole (Hey, yeah)
Thirty days in the hole (Thirty days, thirty days in the hole)
Thirty days in the hole (Yeah, that's what they give you)
Thirty days in the hole (Yeah, quite alright)
Thirty days in the hole (Yeah, thirty, thirty days)
Thirty days in the hole (Said that's what they're giving ya)
Thirty days in the hole (Yeah, yeah)
Thirty days in the hole (Ooh, what they give you)
Thirty days in the hole (Ah, yeah, baby)
Thirty days in the hole (Yeah, yeah, thirty days)

 

I was dreaming of the past
And my heart was beating fast
I began to lose control
Yes, I began to lose control

I didn't want to hurt you
Oh yes, I'm sorry, sorry I made you cry
Oh no, I didn't mean to hurt you
'Cause I'm just a jealous guy
Ooh, jealous guy

I was feeling so insecure, insecure
Yes, I thought you might not love me no, no more
I was shivering inside, yes I was
Ooh, I was shivering inside

I didn't want to hurt you, no no
Ow, I'm sorry that I made you cry, yes I was
I did not want to hurt you
'Cause I'm just a jealous guy
Oh yeah, jealous guy

Love you, baby
I love you, yes I do
Each and every day, each and every way, ooh

Oh yeah, I didn't mean to hurt you
I'm sorry that I made you cry, alright
I did not want to hurt you
I'm just a jealous guy
Ooh, jealous guy
Said I'm a jealous, alright, alright, alright

Don't wanna talk, don't wanna eat or sleep
Just wanna hang my head and run
These empty streets
That I once called my home

Jealous, oh yeah
Jealous, but I don't know why
Do you ever change your mind
Bring your lovin' on home to me

Because you, you send me
You, you thrill me
Honest you do, honest you do, honest you do
