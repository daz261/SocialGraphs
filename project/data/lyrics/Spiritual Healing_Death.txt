[Verse 1]
One mind divided into three
For every problem a personality

Each one trying to protect
For the crisis a person they'll select
With sorrow comes reassurance
With confusion there's ignorance

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Deny who they are
A fantasy gone too far

[Chorus]
Protecting the weak points of the mind
Defensive personalities
Violent one minute calm the next
Defensive personalities

[Verse 2]
Passed down from generations
Years of pain and complications

Darkness was a punishment
Memories time cannot mend
Brutalized from the day of birth
To reality they can't return

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Existing in a world
Of three lives inside of one

[Chorus]
Protecting the weak points of the mind
Defensive personalities
Violent one minute calm the next
Defensive personalities

 

[Verse 1]
Always locking the doors to your mind
Escaping the reality that surrounds you
Using faith as an excuse to kill
A sick way of life is now revealed

[Pre-Chorus 1]
All the prayers in the world can't help you now
A killer, a taker of life is what you are

Speak no more lies
It's your turn to die

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Preach the good word
Speak no more, prepare to burn
A justified torture?
From this may others learn

The life you took
A holy death, a grave mistake
No changing your mind
Your life you should pay

[Chorus]
Practice what you preach
Your loved one is now deceased
Knowledge is at our hands
Never to understand

[Post-Chorus]
Spiritual Healing

[Verse 2]
Blinded by the twisted ways you live
Kill for religion, will the lord forgive?
Idiocy has stricken your mind
A real life hell you will find

[Pre-Chorus 1]
All the prayers in the world can't help you now
A killer, a taker of life is what you are

Speak no more lies
It's your turn to die

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Preach the good word
Speak no more, prepare to burn
A justified torture?
From this may others learn

The life you took
A holy death, a grave mistake
No changing your mind
Your life you should pay

[Chorus]
Practice what you preach
Your loved one is now deceased
Knowledge is at our hands
Never to understand

 

[Verse 1]
Those who are a waste of life
Use up air that others could breathe
Human leeches all around
Superior is what they believe

[Pre-Chorus]
Fake is the word you represent
Your existence on earth I resent
At the cost of others you get by
Each word that you speak is a lie

[Chorus]
Low life - That's all you'll ever be
Lies in effect - That's what you like to see

[Post-Chorus]
Hiding behind material values
That help cover up your weakness
Never to change, always to look
For an easy way out of life

[Bridge]
A pathetic excuse for a human being

[Verse 2]
Nothing to back you up
Never giving second thought
Thinking you fool the world
Into seeing something you are not

[Pre-Chorus]
Fake is the word you represent
Your existence on earth I resent
At the cost of others you get by
Each word that you speak is a lie

[Chorus]
Low life - That's all you'll ever be
Lies in effect - That's what you like to see

 

[Verse 1]
Extending a life
With total resistance
To fatal disease
Future methods of science

[Pre-Chorus]
Replacing what is real
By using technology
Population control
Selecting those who will breed

A specific type of form
Chosen for the unborn
A mind without emotion
Progressive anatomy

[Chorus]
Genetic reconstruction
Evolution in production

[Verse 2]
Producing a race
Of human machines
A new age of existence
The world will see

[Pre-Chorus]
Replacing what is real
By using technology
Population control
Selecting those who will breed

A specific type of form
Chosen for the unborn
A mind without emotion
Progressive anatomy

[Chorus]
Genetic reconstruction
Evolution in production

 

[Verse 1]
Always locking the doors to your mind

[Verse 1]
Transforming your mind from the inside out
Overcoming fear that made you doubt
Observing what is stored in the subconscious
Trusting what you feel with your gut response

[Pre-Chorus]
See past the dark
And use your energy
Learn from these images
Thoughts that we call dreams

[Chorus]
This power lies within the mind
Gain wisdom through abilities
Change what's to come in future time
Avoiding pain and misery

[Bridge]
Look through the fake from what is real
Making decisions by what you feel
Live for the future and not the past
The weak of mind will never last

[Verse 2]
Perceiving visions that reoccur
Analyse your dreams to gain
A better perspective of your life
In control of your destiny with mind and soul

[Pre-Chorus]
See past the dark
And use your energy
Learn from these images
Thoughts that we call dreams

[Chorus]
This power lies within the mind
Gain wisdom through abilities
Change what's to come in future time
Avoiding pain and misery
