[Verse 1]
I woke up last night and I thought I was going to die (sick)
I woke up last night and I thought I was going to die (ooh, sick)
The doctor came a running and my family stood by (Well, say)

[Bridge 1]
He left three Bop Pills for ten, two and four
He left three Bop Pills for ten, two and four
Oh man, when they hit me, I landed in the middle of the floor (ah, sick)

[Chorus]
And I bopped and rocked and rolled like I never did before
And I bopped and rocked and rolled on every inch of that floor
Yeah, B-O-P, bop
Well, P-I-L-L-S
Bop pills

[Solo]

[Verse 2]
I went to see old doc and I couldn't get near his shack (oh loaded, man)
I went to see old doc and I couldn't get near his shack (yeah,sick)
They were crawlin' in the front door and bopping right on out the back (yeah, I'm telling you)

[Bridge 2]
I waited 8 long hours just to knock upon his door (yeah)
I waited 8 long hours just to knock upon his door
I came to pay my bills and brought money for a hundred more (ah, sick)

[Chorus]
And I bopped and rocked and rolled like I never did before
And I bopped and rocked and rolled on every inch of that floor
Yeah, B-O-P, bop
Well, P-I-L-L-S
Bop pills

 

[Intro]
You better ask my mama how to make a monster

[Verse 1]
I'm the creature from the black leather lagoon
I'm a beautiful monster from outer space, too
Learned how to shake my hips in the inner sanctum
Satan gave me tips and then I thanked him
I'm the creature from the black leather lagoon

[Chorus]
Yeah, black, black, black, black leather
Smash smash, black, black leather
Kill, kill, black, black leather
Crash, crash, black, black leather
I'm the creature from the black leather lagoon

[Verse 2]
I'm a chicken-fried, fire-eating son of a gun
Conceived by my devil daddy on a chicken run
Like a fireball flying down thunder road
Daddy made mama but she shoulda said no
I'm a rawhide monster they named Number One


[Chorus]
Yeah, black, black, black, black leather
Smash smash, black, black leather
Kill, kill, black, black leather
Crash, crash, black, black leather
I'm the creature from the black leather lagoon

[Solo]
Ah, ah
Yeah

[Verse 3]
I'm the creature from the black leather lagoon
I'm a genuine juvenile delinquent from the moon
I'm like a hundred billion hydrogen bombs
Mama wanted a goat, but I got mom's
I'm the creature from the black leather lagoon

[Chorus]
Yeah, black, black, black, black leather
Smash smash, black, black leather
Kill, kill, black, black leather
Crash, crash, black, black leather
I'm the creature from the black leather lagoon

[Chorus]
Yeah, black, black, black, black leather
Smash smash, black, black leather
Kill, kill, black, black leather
Crash, crash, black, black leather
I'm the creature from the black leather lagoon

[Outro]
Lagoon, ah

 

Well I been seein' red and singing the blues far back as I can tell
Til daisys gone from heaven and decorate the gates of hell
Now, you might believe the world is sweet and fine as sugar candy
But I myself believe in whatever comes in handy

Daisys up your butterfly
Daisys up your butterfly
Makes me up and wonder why
You got daisys up your butterfly

You're whistlin' past the graveyard, hopin' for the best
But a hum job after K-Mart just might wreck that party dress
Your poodle smokes, he'll probably choke and die in his own mink coat
Your rainbow's bringing rain that's gonna sink your damn love boat

Daisys up your butterfly
Daisys up your butterfly
Makes me up and wonder why
You got daisys up your butterfly

Well I been seein' red and singing the blues far back as I can tell
Til daisys came from heaven and decorate the gates of hell
Now, you might believe the world is sweet and fine as sugar candy
But I myself believe in whatever comes in handy

Daisys up your butterfly
Daisys up your butterfly
Makes me up and wonder why
You got daisys up your butterfly

Daisys up your butterfly
Maybe, maybe not
Could be daisys up your butterfly or a bad day at Black Rock

 

Well, no holes barred, watch your toes
Look out baby, everything goes

Ooooo
Everything goes
Well, goodness don't know
Everything goes

Yeah, you got your G-strings and gin and nylon hoes
Chicken pot pie, everything goes

Ooooo
Everything goes
Well, goodness don't know
Everything goes

Women swimmin' in chili down at smokey joe's
Hopped up hotheads, everything goes

Ooooo
Everything goes
Well, goodness don't know
Everything goes

Debbie had a donkey and two old crows
Said "look out baby, everything goes!"

Ooooo
Everything goes
Well, goodness don't know
Everything goes

Well, you can't get ahead by who you know
Kissy kissy, bang bang, everything goes

Ooooo
Everything goes
Well, goodness don't know
Everything goes

Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go
Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go
Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go
Let's go, let's go go go go, go man, go!
Well, goodness don't know
Everything goes

 

Hey, I'm on my way
On a journey outta this world
Hey, I'm on my way
On a journey outta this world
Swirling through the vortex to the center of a girl

Well, I've gotta rocket '88
Prone 269
Spinnin' around and down
Leavin' everything behind
Let go of the controls and
Slip outside my mind

Space begins to curve
Light begins to twist
Across a thigh of satin and
Through a veil of mist
There's a girl's netherworld
Lookin' for a kiss

So, hey, I'm on my way
On a journey outta this world
Hey, I'm on my way
On a journey outta this world
Swirling through the vortex to the center of a girl

I'm glidin' through this friction
Like some science fiction thrill
Gettin' off in these dimensions
Where time itself stands still
Flowin' through a whirlpool
To a she-feast wrapped in silk

Hey, I'm on my way
On a journey outta this world
Hey, I'm on my way
On a journey outta this world
Swirling through the vortex to the center of a girl

Hey, I'm on my way
On a journey outta this world
Hey, I'm on my way
On a journey outta this world
Swirling through the vortex to the center of a girl

Hey, I'm on my way
Hey, I'm on my way
Hey, I'm on my way
Hey, I'm on my way

Hey, I'm on my way

Hey, I'm on my way

 

Fatima had a fetish for a wiggle in her scoot
From her big tall heels on her big bad boots
She said saddle up a buzz buzz
Saddle up a buzz buzz
Saddle up a buzz buzz
Saddle up a buzz buzz

Tarzan drove a stingray on a fiberglass jungle
Swung from high tension wires and yelled down at the humble
Hey, saddle up a buzz buzz
Saddle up a buzz buzz
Saddle up a buzz buzz
Saddle up a buzz buzz buzz buzz

Rabid Rat Fink caught an eighty foot wave
Hit the bonsai pipeline and rode it straight to the grave
Screamin' saddle up a buzz buzz
Saddle up a buzz buzz
Saddle up a buzz buzz
Saddle up a buzz buzz

Callin' all KNIF's on a collision course
Don't let it bug you if you ain't got no horse
Whoa! Saddle up a buzz buzz
Saddle up a buzz buzz
Saddle up a buzz buzz
Saddle up a buzz buzz

Buzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
Rock it right
Buzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
Rock it right
Buzzzzzzzzzzzzzz

Saddle up a buzz buzz
Saddle up a buzz buzz
Saddle up a buzz buzz
Saddle up a buzz buzz

 

[Verse 1]
Well, I'm strolling along in the city park
Met that baby standing in the dark
Took that loving baby by the hand
I let her know that I'm her loving man
I let her know that I'm her loving man

[Chorus 1]
That love rubbed off on me
That baby wouldn't let me be
That baby took me by the hand
That baby shook, shook the man
That baby jumped right on me
That love rubbed off on me
Hey, hey

[Verse 2]
I'm a hot-rod fiend for fancy cars
Drive-in movies and her caviar
Big sport coats and a diamond rings
I'm going down to that little thing
I'm going down to that little ol' thing

[Chorus 2]
That stuff rubbed off on me
That baby wouldn't let me be
That lover wouldn't let me go
That woman hollered, "No, no, no"
That baby was the one I crave
That baby followed to my grave
Hey, hey, well

[Verse 3]
Hey, I'm the happiest man and I'm so in love
Well, I even take off my clothes
I like to get and I like to give
I like to love her and I love to live
I give her loving and I love to live

[Chorus 3]
That stuff rubbed off on me
That baby wouldn't let me be
That woman wouldn't let me go
That baby hollered "No, no, no"
That baby took, took my hand
That lover took me from this land
That lover took a hold on me
Ooh, oh let me be
Now, oh, baby take me by the hand
Oh, from this land
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh baby, baby
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

 

I'm like a ring tailed monkey, a-hangin’ from a bamboo tree
I'm like a native in the jungle, as restless as I can be
And if I hear you stalkin' through the grass
I wanna get a message to you fast
I’m gonna pick up a log and a-beat out my love for you

I'm like an apeman Tarzan swingin' from a long great vine
And I'm a-lookin' for you, so that I can make you mine
I would climb on a tree, so good and high
Then let out with that Tarzan cry
Then I pick up a log and a-beat out my love for you

Well, now that I'm in the jungle, I'll do as the natives do
I'll do things their way and act like it’s nothing new
And if I see you sittin’ in a cool glade
I'm gonna make the loudest sound ever made
’Cause I'm gonna pick up a log and a-beat out my love for you

Well, I'm gonna pick up a log and a-beat out my love for you
Yeah, beat out my love for you
Oh, yeah-yeah-yeah, honey you know
I'm gonna beat out my love for you

 

[Verse 1:]
The warden threw a party in the county jail
The prison band was there and they began to wail
The band was jumping and the joint began to swing
You should've heard those knocked out jailbirds sing

[Chorus:]
Let's rock, everybody, let's rock
Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancing to the Jailhouse Rock

[Verse 2:]
Spider Murphy played the tenor saxophone
Little Joe was blowing on the slide trombone
The drummer boy from Illinois went crash, boom, bang
The whole rhythm section was the Purple Gang

[Chorus:]
Let's rock, everybody, let's rock
Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancing to the Jailhouse Rock

[Verse 3:]
Number forty-seven said to number three
"You're the cutest jailbird I ever did see
I sure would be delighted with your company"
She said "come on and do the Jailhouse Rock with me"

[Chorus:]
Let's rock, everybody, let's rock
Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancing to the Jailhouse Rock

[Verse 4:]
The sad sack was a sitting on a block of stone
Way over in the corner weeping all alone
The warden said, "Hey, buddy, don't you be no square
If you can't find a partner use a wooden chair"

[Chorus:]
Let's rock, everybody, let's rock
Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancing to the Jailhouse Rock

[Verse 5:]
Shifty Henry said to Bugs, "For Heaven's sake
No one's looking, now's our chance to make a break"
Bugsy turned to Shifty and he said, "Nix nix
I want to stick around a while and get my kicks."

[Chorus:]
Let's rock, everybody, let's rock
Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancing to the Jailhouse Rock

[Outro]
Dancing to the Jailhouse Rock
Dancing to the Jailhouse Rock
Dancing to the Jailhouse Rock
Dancing to the Jailhouse Rock

 

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
It's just another red hot night back at the go go lounge
Her spiked heels sank into that penetration sound
Cootchie-cootchie-coo, feels so good it's killing me
Help [?] ... the police for the ... [?]

[Chorus]
She's going to
Jackyard backoff

From the perfume fields of France

Just about half of me ... [?] take like this
Hey ... [?] baby ... [?] a little kiss

[Chorus]

[Chorus]
Back off now

She's going to
