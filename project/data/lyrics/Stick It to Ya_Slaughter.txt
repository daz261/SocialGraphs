Wanna take her to the movies
She don't like no show
But she likes to see how far
Your credit card can go

Gonna push it to the limit
All the way to the top
Oh, don't say that word
'Cause you know she just can't stop

'Cause she's goin' shoppin' on you
Shoppin' on you

It's Mastercard or Visa
Or American Express
She knows all of your limits
And which stores are the best
In Beverly Hills, oh yes

She's drivin' in your sportscar
Bought her tickets to Paris, France
She's gamblin' in Las Vegas
She's got to take the chance
On your cash, babe

She ain't got not bills at home
And as a matter of fact
She ain't got no house to own
She's driving in that big black limousine
And she acts just like a fashion beauty queen
Say hello to Miss Universe
Thank you very much

She wants more, more, more
She wants more, more, more

She took your very last dollar
With a calculatin' grin
Hey dude, I feel so sorry for you
'Cause I know where you've been
It's kind of hurts right here, doesn't it? Ow

She ain't got not bills at home
And as a matter of fact
She ain't got no house to own
She's driving in that big black limousine
And she acts just like a fashion beauty queen
Say hello to Miss USA fellas

She wants more, more, more
She wants more, more, more
Oh yeah, whoo

[guitar solo]

She ain't got not bills at home
And as a matter of fact
She ain't got no house to own
She's driving in that big black limousine
And she acts just like a fashion beauty queen

"Thank you, thank you very, very much
You have just won $200,000 for shopping anywhere in the United States
Such as Los Angeles, New York, Chicago, Dallas, Wichita, West Palm Beach, Honolulu, and don't forget all those Pennsylvania-type places, if you know what I mean..."

"Hey, my wallet!"
"Oh, no!"

She wants more, more, more
She wants more, more, more
She wants more, more, more
She wants more, more, more

Huhh!
"Oh, the bitch done ripped you off, too?"[?]
