You don't have to tell me what you're still looking for
Two arms to hold you and a voice to say "That's alright, you can spend the night"
Well, come around

'Cos I've been there and these are the notes from the overground
The World Saxophone Quartet, the smell of violets
And a passing friend won't let you down

Listen to the rhythm of the rain falling
Say you're gonna change your foolish ways
Make a promise, break a promise in the same day
It goes the same way, anyway
So you pray for silence and its sadness and its violence
To be washed away
One day

I understand that state you've reached of being unreachable
Somewhere out there where only the music plays
Loneliness and being alone don't always mean the same
Who needs the movie? You can see the music anyway

A Sketch For Winter, a Burgundy and sanctuary can make me stay
When I feel that way
And if my words don't say the things that they were meant to say
And if confusion comes and carries all my words away
And if you still don't understand, I wanna hold your hand
And look at it this way...

Someone singing's better than the war they're winning
Winging its way, your way or my way, any day, anyway
Stray

The sun dying on a dusty room
Tv lying to me through the gloom
Even remote control can't change this mood
Get outta london while the getting's good
Get outta london while I know I could
Get outta london

Train's come just ride and believe
The engine running's all the music I need
I've got a fear of the past and a hunger to feed
Get outta london and you shall be free
Get outta london and it's guaranteed
Get outta london

I walked the avenue of dumb signs
Meant nothing and it felt fine

Then I remembered what was really mine
A silver shiver running down my spine

Down where the streets are pave with sick schemes
The river's running like a snake through a dream
The politicians gaze across it's slime
I need another way to waste my time
Get outta london, get outta london

I saw the spectre of charity
And he didn't seem brotherly
Popping up what should be blown away
A brotherhood of man in disarray
I got hit by the dreamers disease
Where your big ideas
Don't make connection with your buckling knees
And saw the greed and agreed that it sucked
But they said, "don't laugh at money cos it's bad luck"
Get outta london, get outta london

 

Words and music by roddy frame

Over my head, over my head
And I can't break free from these chains
Over my head go the things that we said

And I long to be above pain

When your heart is broken
Mine's in two
And I'm over my head in blue
Over the love of you

 

Words and music by roddy frame

I look around me and what do I see?
Sadness surrounds me, alone as can be
With too much time and too much distance
These chains that bind me
They won't set me free
I look behind me and coming for me
Is my best friend, she's my resistance

Chorus:
So if you find yourself alone and so unkind
And if you've asked yourself, over and over
And even if your heartbeats hurt like goodbyes
Try, try, try
Open your mind, spend some time
With the gentle kind

I was torn between the darkness and the light
Lost to all belief that it could turn out right
But my quiet friend turned me round
Made me see again
Took my hand, said nothing much
No lesson learned, just a gentle touch
And I am coming round
I am coming round again

Chorus

Cos' in a hard world, with fastness and an eye on the money
I heard a soft voice, saying "never worry, hold on honey"
When my world was gone, a whisper kind of eased my mind
And I am holdin' on
To the gentle kind

All the madness in the mirror
The tremblin' and the tears
It takes a long time comin' out
It's comin' out of here
I've been wandering your london town
And it's wearin' out my shoes
It's a long road comin' down
Comin' down with the blues

But when you hold me and really make love to me
I know that love is true forgiveness
Time on my mind is time spent with you
But it's time that I can't find
With the notting hill blues

Lovers pass me on the gate

Like distant cousings, removed
Holding hands, it seems like an act of fate
And I'm almost moved
But love has left me standing still
With no directions and no clues
No speech to let my feelings loose
A celebration of the blues

But when you hold me and really make love to me
I know that love is true forgiveness
Out on the road I was down with the crew
Now I'm all alone, on the run
With the notting hill blues

And it's a lonely, lonely time
Sadness preys upon my mind
A telephone and a bottle of booze
But who do you call? when your tongue tied
Up all night

 

Words and music by roddy frame

Awake
In winter's crystal hours
And give to what gets you in the end
For the sake of a love that just devours
And smiles and takes
And lays you down again

Run free
The moon is always female
Straight to what's still and will not bend

Don't wait for the sunshine to surround you
Consume and fake
And let you down again

Cos' life is short
And you better get smart
To the people who know nothing
And surround you

Stand straight
In what kills you and confounds you
And break it's chains
And still believe
