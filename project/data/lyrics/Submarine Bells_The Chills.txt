Each evening the sun sets in five billion places
Seen by ten billion eyes set in five billion faces
Then they close in a daze and wait for the dawning
But the daylight and sunrise are brighter in our eyes
Where night cannot devour golden solar power

Once we were damned, now I guess we are angels
For we passed through the dark and eluded the dangers
Then awoke with a start to startling changes
All the tension is ended, the sentence suspended
And darkness now sparkles and gleams

And it all seems larger than life to me
I find it rather hard to believe

And so I stand and the sound goes straight through my body
I'm so bloated up, happy, I can throw things around me
And I'm growing in stages and have been for ages
Just singing and floating and free

Oh (Dum dum, da de da da)
Dum de dum dum, dum de dum dum
It's a heavenly pop hit if anyone wants it
Oh (Dum dum, da de da da)
Dum de dum dum, dum de dum dum
It's a heavenly pop hit
It's something that we're humming as we

Swoop low on trees or we sweep under carpets
We can dive into suns, though it's not recommended
We can hover silent and listen closely

It all seems larger than life to me
I find it hard to believe

So where was our home, well, our home was in tears
For its fruit had gone bad, they'd been that way for years
Yet their lives are elastic, they should be fantastic
They should be expanding

Oh (Dum dum, da de da da)
Dum de dum dum, dum de dum dum
It's a heavenly pop hit if anyone wants it
Oh (Dum dum, da de da da)
Dum de dum dum, dum de dum dum
It's a heavenly pop hit for anybody
Oh, for those that still want it

 

You don't need to repeat it, repeat it
I hared it the first time time time

Well, you won't stop by
And tell me what the trouble is
I couldn't care less, ha ha, but my double does
And he told me we're both superseded
So why not drop by, burst my bubble for me

So simple to be cynical
Respond to things with ease
Once an attitudes selected
Then behavior is a breeze

They think they've got it covered
But they've got it all wrong
Hard people make hard times far worse
Not the reverse

It's the contemporary trap

They want to tell you where it's at
When the past is thought irrelevant
Our destiny's black

For they've limited themselves
To an urbanite perspective
And the build-up, rear-down
Press-gang acid attack

Familiarity breeds contempt
And suppresses attempts

Familiarity breeds contempt

Sour seeds grown into stifling creepers
Bitterness feeds on a drive alive
And now my heart bleeds
Familiarity breeds contempt
And a row of resentments

Familiarity breeds contempt
And I'm not exempt

 

Snow alights as dark sea grows
Then far below lies softly glowing
Snow turns slowly into water
I know deep down hidden in you submarine bells chime
Gold and groaning, sunlit toning, submerged sound sublime
So the colder, deeper tolling
Reaches dissolution
You wish a vicious whirlpool go swirling round and round
I can watch in wonder as your gaze shifts past my shoulder
Just a glimpsed abyss that flashes at me
I know deep down hidden in you submarine bells chime
Gold and groaning, sunlit toining, submerged sound sublime
Since the weakest currents bruise it
Someday I may lose this
Immersed in words sand miss you
Kiss foaming waves goodbye
I slice the surface here beside you
Lungs filled liquid yell I love you
Sound moves further underwater
Deep and dark my submarine bells groan in greens and grey
Mine would chime a thousand times
To make you feel okay
K-k-k okahy
