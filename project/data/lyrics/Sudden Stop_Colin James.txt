(Intro)
Well I got stones in my passway
And my road seems dark at night
I got stones in my pathway
And my road seems dark at night
I got pains in my heart
And they've taken my appetite

When I first saw you I heard the angels sing
I thought of Adam and Eve and that love thing
Oh, I was blinded by the light and I just couldn't see
Papa hidin' up in your apple tree
I really hope you're satisfied
I just came back to say goodbye

Girl I found your little black book
You know I opened it up to get a second look
(I had to get a second, second look)
I saw my best friend's name there on the page
Five gold stars beside his name
I really hope you're satisfied
I just came back to say goodbye

(CHORUS)
I just came back to say goodbye
(I just came back) Goodbye baby
I just came back to say goodbye
(I just came back) Goodbye baby

I felt real bad thought I'd give you a call
I didn't look up your number I just looked on the wall
You know your best friend said you'd gone for the night
Goin' downtown with your jeans on tight
I really hope you're satisfied
I just came back to say goodbye

(CHORUS)
(Repeat to Fade)

 

Well I want you to love me
Well I want you to love me
Well I want you to love me

Whoa yeah
Whoa yeah
Whoa baby
You know what pleases me
You know what pleases me

Well I want you to kiss me
Well I want you to kiss me
Well I want you to kiss me

Whoa yeah
Whoa yeah
Whoa baby
You know what pleases me
You know what pleases me

Early in the morning
Any time at night
Well I can feel your tender lips
Making me feel alright

Keep on loving me girl
Ahow how how
Keep on loving me baby
Whoa yeah
Whoa yeah
Whoa baby
You know what pleases me

SOLO

Early in the morning
Sny time at night
Well I can feel your tender lips
Making me feel alright

Keep on loving me girl
Ahow how how
Keep on loving me baby
Whoa yah
Whoa yah
Whoa baby
You know what pleases me
