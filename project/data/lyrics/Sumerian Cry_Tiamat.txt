He comes at night when the moon is worshipped
A living evil on golden wings
He comes to take me to the abandoned land
The land where darkness is ablazed
A leap in the dark, a step into the forgotten
Through the gates of the betrayal breeze
I know that the time has come for me
...My soul is given to the shadows

(pre.ch.:)
He comes to bring your soul to where it belongs
He will give you the dark and black

(ch.:)
A ghastly scream from an inhuman shape
And your body is layed to rest
A giant evil inside your soul
Will take you to the malicious paradise

(repeat ch.)

I glorify my gloomy fate
As I reach the point of sins
I glorify the land of the dark
The place where I am one
I deny the faith of christ
'cause I have seen the truth
The truth is evil, dark and black
And the evil is for all of us

(pre.ch.)

(ch.)

(repeat ch.)

 

In the fields of death at an hour of destruction the wind blew cold
A vast field of tombstones and cenotaphs all moisture-stained
As I walked across the field I noticed a human circle formation
Standing at the edge of a yet uncovered grave deep in mourn

(ch.:)
Buried and forgotten
In the dark and cold
In the moisty ground
Burial at night

Funeral

In the name of the father, the son and the antichrist
Ashes to ashes and dust to dust to reign in death
From the innermost depths of the open sepulcher
I heard a human cry for life and freedom

(ch.)

"I was mortal but I am fiend, I was merciless
My teeth shatter as I speak to you
Yet it's not with the chilliness of the night
But this hideousness is insufferable"

(ch.)

That deep, hollow, inhuman voice echoed
Echoed down from the pits of the uncovered grave
The former human voice was now transformed
The former human voice is now the voice of the fiend

(ch.)

(bridge:)
Behold the vast formations of a funeral in the dark
Behold with fear the signs after a nocturnal funeral

(repeat bridg)

 

Born on a gloomy night
Raised the evil way
A son of an unnamed
Born by freak

Molten books, ancient scripts
Dreadful tales of evil ways
Interpred the child
Cleanse the world

When the stars are right
They will rise from the sea
Creatures from out of time
Creatures out of mind

Sacrifice to the lord
Light fires upon the hills
Scream the words, the key
Prepare the funeral

(pre.ch.:)
Sacrifice yourself to the master
Sacrifice your soul to the great
Scream out the words, scream the key
The demolition prophecies are true

(ch.:)
Behold
The funeral
Be evil
Evilized
See that
The world is lost
It's evil
Evilized

Behold the master
Migrate to the surface
Wave goodbye to your soul
And to your mind

Mind-blasting terror
Extreme mass manipulation
Will start up the mayhem
As evil returns

Rancid bodies dismembered
Rigid facial expressions
All covered in blood
Cascades of brains

Reed deep into the books
The mayhemic tales of terror
Horrifying evil visions
Behold the return

(pre.ch.)

(ch.)

 

A witch haunted fullmoon is on the rise
Tortured by fate and by sorcery
Rising in the crimson red sky
A warning of what evil to come

Behold the dawn
As it is the last
Bow down to
The sign

The sign for the evil arise
Arise
To the axis in the sky
Full moon
Tremble with fear infore it
Evil
In the sign of the pentagram

Reborn in the heat from the flames
Babtized in blood and in fire
Raised to bring darkness to the day
Between dusk and dawn

Perish in the sign
Unknown from behind
A funeral for man
A shadow in time

Behold the flames torture their souls
Whisper in woods the sign of the pentagram
