Devil's driving down the track
Helens wheels they won't turn back
Engine racing down a one way street
Speeds chasing that red line heat
Into the blackness into the night
Out of the tunnel into the light
Red for danger that's just for show
Climb aboard come as you go

Hard to steer when the devil's driving
Helens wheels and the brakes won't hold
Hard to steer when the devil's driving
Helens wheels and the brakes won't hold

Too smart to come she just arrived
Only gave her one but she's using five
Minutes of time in the usual place
If I was strapped in you could sit on my place
The doors were locked the windows sealed
Hitting me with the jack was the devil's deal
Blue light flashing as the lipstick smudge
Diving for cover in a tunnel of glove

Hard to steer when the devil's driving
Helens wheels and the brakes won't hold
Hard to steer when the devil's driving
Helens wheels and the brakes won't hold

Something's driving me, I don't know where
Something down in my cellar somewhere
No one waiting for me down the line
No one waiting for me this time, check it out

Hard to steer when the devil's driving
Hell on wheels and the brakes won't hold
Hard to steer when the devil's driving
Hell on wheels and the brakes won't hold

Knuckle down stick shift take it slow
Easy come means easy go
Lay off the gas make it last
'Cos under my hood she's blowing fast
Into the blackness into the night
Out of the tunnel into the light
Red for danger, just for show
Climb aboard come as you go

Hard to steer when the devil's driving
Helens wheels and the brakes won't hold
Hard to steer when the devil's driving
Helens wheels and the brakes won't hold

Hard to steer, that's it
Hard to steer, oh
Hard to steer, when the devil's driving, come on
Hard to steer, you know it's hard to steer
Hard to steer, when the devil's driving

 

Living in the city can be a cold and lonely place to be
Living in the shadows where there is no sun there in no breeze
Drinking stale water, having to pay for the privilege
Talk about your freedom, I'll take you where I think it is

Gypsy Road is the highway that I run to
Gypsy Road, welcome to your dreams
Gypsy Road is the highway that I run to
Gypsy Road, oh gypsy road

Living by my own rules, a rebel yell and a rebel creed
Keep your life simple, try not to take what you don't need
Think about freedom, dream a little every day
Suddenly you'll find yourself there, follow me, walk this way

Gypsy Road is the highway that I run to
Gypsy Road, welcome to your dreams
Gypsy Road is the highway that I run to
Gypsy Road, oh gypsy road
Gypsy road
All right

Gypsy Road is the highway that I run to
Gypsy Road, welcome to your dreams
Gypsy Road is the highway that I run to
Gypsy Road, welcome to your dreams
Gypsy Road is the highway that I run to
Gypsy Road, welcome to your dreams
Gypsy Road is the highway that I run to
Gypsy Road, welcome to your dreams

I'll find my dreams
You find yours too

 

She fixed me in the corner with that beautiful brown eye
She says, I'd like to meet you
I was so surprised
Well what can I do for you?
What can you do for me?
We made for the exit, had to wait and see
I hope I'm not wasting your precious time
I know you're not wasting mine
We came together over coffee with milk
She never stopped 'till every drop was spilt

She was a Zulu Lulu
Broke my back and my heart at the same time, honey, well
Just a Zulu Lulu
I had to move on, when I came back she'd gone, gone, gone

She dropped to her knees, I guess she had religion
She lived with her mother, had been a good girl twice
When I asked her to comment on her present position
She said she liked to take a lay preacher's advice
I ain't looking for sympathy
But prayers for the wicked are kinda nice
She said, I don't like to preach to the converted
I said, you can be a good girl more than twice, like this

She was a Zulu Lulu
Broke my back and my heart at the same time, it was nice
Just a Zulu Lulu
I had to move on, when I came back she'd gone, gone, gone
Gone, gone, gone, gone away somewhere

I ain't looking for sympathy, oh no
But prayers for the wicked are always nice
She looked me up and down and said
Assegai for me
I began to see God she said, wait and see babe
Wait and see babe, wait and see babe
Wait, wait, oh, gonna'

She was a Zulu Lulu
Broke my back and my heart at the same time, it was nice
She was a Zulu Lulu
Had to move on, when I came back she'd gone, gone

She was a Zulu Lulu
She broke my back and my heart at the same time, honey, well
Just a Zulu Lulu
Had to move on, when I came back she'd gone, gone, gone
Gone, gone, gone

 

I've watched the open line, I'd swing the sun up in the sky
I threw down the screens and opened up the door
The sun came streaming in and it shone out through your eyes
As you laughed and threw your gospel on the floor, cry

Hey, spirit of joy
Oh, you make this fool feel so wise
Hey, spirit of joy
Feels so good, you came into my life

But your mind is where your mouth is and I'll tell the truth today
I see you're the one that I've been waiting for
You've not been 'round this way already, so now my time has come
And now I see just what I'm looking for, cry

Hey, spirit of joy
Well, you make this fool feel so wise
Hey, spirit of joy
Feels so good since you came into my life

Hey, spirit of joy
Feel the daylight break into a day
Hey, spirit of joy
Love

Hey, spirit of joy
Love
Hey, spirit of joy
Love

Hey, spirit of joy
Love's comin', come on
Hey, spirit of joy
Feel it comin', yeah, yeah

Hey, spirit of joy

 

Cold sunlight falling on me
Cold sunlight falling on me
I am a lonely man
Sorrow is my friend
Fall asleep as the dawn comes up
A ray of hope again

Hold the crystal vision for a second
Let it pass
Hold the crystal vision for a moment
Make it last

Summer so quickly gone
Darkness be my friend
Nothing lasts forever
But the certainty of change

I am a lonely man
Sorrow is my friend
Nothing lasts forever
But the certainty of change
Nothing last forever
But the certainty of change
