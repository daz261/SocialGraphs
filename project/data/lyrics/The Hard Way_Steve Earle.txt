[Verse 1]
I woke up this morning
And I took a look around at all that I got
These days I've been looking in the mirror
And wondering if that's me looking back or not
I'm still the apple of my mama's eye
I'm my daddy's worst fears realized
Here of late all this real estate
Don't seem all that real to me sometimes

[Chorus]
I'm back out on that road again
Turn this beast into the wind
There are those that break and bend
I'm the other kind, I'm the other kind

[Verse 2]
Now my old buddy, what's his name?
Says, "Man, what the hell are you thinking about?
Fool, you got two of everything
But you hang your head just like you was down and out"
And I'm damn sure not suffering from a lack of love
There's plenty more where that came from
Ah, but leave it up to me to say something wrong
And hurt someone before I'm done

[Chorus]
I'm back out on that road again
Turn this beast into the wind
There are those that break and bend
I'm the other kind

Back out on that road again
Turn this beast into the wind
There are those that break and bend
I'm the other kind, I'm the other kind

[Verse 3]
You see it used to be I was really free
I didn't need no gasoline to run
Before you could say, "Jack Kerouac"
You'd turn your back and I'd be gone
Yeah but nowadays I got me two good wheels
And I seek refuge in aluminum and steel
Aw, it takes me out there for just a little while
And the years fall away with every mile

[Chorus]
I'm back out on that road again
Turn this beast into the wind
There are those that break and bend
I'm the other kind

Back out on that road again
Turn this beast into the wind
There are those that break and those that bend
I'm the other kind, I'm the other kind
I'm the other kind, I'm the other kind

 

No curtains on my window
Outside the sun is sinking low
I feel you letting go
I will promise you anything

Wind whispering in your ear
I'll tell you what you want to hear
If you'll only let me near
I will promise you anything

Well, I don't have to prove my intentions are golden
I don't have to tell you where we're going
Feel something wild, baby, out there blowing
If you follow me

Run with me, if you dare
Hold on, I'm gonna take you there
Solemn as a prayer
I will promise you anything

Well, I don't have to prove my intentions are golden
I don't have to tell you where we're going
Feel something wild, baby, out there blowing
If you follow me

No curtains on my window
Outside the moon is hanging low
True colors start to show
I will promise you anything

I'll promise you anything
I'll promise you anything
I will promise you anything
I will promise you anything

 

My name is Billy Austin
I'm twenty-nine years old
I was born in Oklahoma
Quarter Cherokee, I'm told
Don't remember Oklahoma
It's been so long since I left home
Seems like I've always been in prison
Like I've always been alone

Didn't mean to hurt nobody
Never thought I'd cross that line
I held up a filling station
Like I'd done a hundred times
The kid done like I told him
And he lay face down on the floor
Guess I'll never know what made me
Turn and walk back through that door

The shot rang out like thunder
My ears rang like a bell
No one came running
So I called the cops myself
Took their time to get there
And I guess I could've run
I knew I should be feeling something
But I never shed tear one

I didn't even make the papers
Because I only killed one man
But my trial was over quickly
And then the long hard way began
The court appointed lawyer
Couldn't look me in the eye
He just stood up and closed his briefcase
When they sentenced me to die

And now my waiting's over
As the final hour drags by
I ain't about to tell you
That I don't deserve to die
There's twenty-seven men here
Mostly black and brown and poor
Most of them are guilty
But who are you to say for sure?

So when the preacher comes to get me
And they shave off all my hair
Could you take that long walk with me
Knowing Hell is waiting there?
Could you pull that switch yourself, sir
With a sure and steady hand?
Could you still tell yourself, sir
That you're better than I am?

My name is Billy Austin
I'm twenty-nine years old
I was born in Oklahoma
Quarter Cherokee, I'm told

 

Oh, you who hail from Ontario
Know the tale of the Donnelly's, oh
Died at the hands of a mob that night
Every child and man by the oil torch light
Jim Donnelly was no angel sure
But they burned his barn, broke down the door
Well, the children cried while they killed old Jim
Then they killed his wife, then they turned on them
No judge, no jury, no hangman
No justice in Ontario

A hundred years or more have turned
And you always hear how much we've learned
Well, a man lay dead in a Port Hope bar
And the blood ran red on a hardwood floor
And the big men ran through the nearest door
Only one man knew what had happened for sure
Well, one and all wore the outlaws brand
And the big bikes roared through the Great Northland
When you live on the edge of the law
You know justice in Ontario

The blue smoke still hung in the air
No one spoke when the cops got there
Well, the local constable made the call
"Send us Corporal Terry Hall"
They all sang a different tune
When Corporal Hall walked in the room
With his picture book and a list of names
One by one the witnesses came
And they told him what he wanted to know
Justice in Ontario

The provincial cops searched far and wide
And the outlaws ran, but they could not hide
And they brought 'em in, every single one
Save the man who actually fired the gun
It was down in London, they were tried
And the guilty man stood free outside
When he took the stand to pay his debt
The judge was blind and the jury deaf
In Kingston Town, they're locked up still
When the sun goes down and the air is chill
You could swear you heard Jim Donnelly's ghost cry
"Justice in Ontario"

Justice in Ontario
Justice in Ontario
Justice in Ontario
Justice in Ontario

 

[Verse]
He was standing on the corner
A hundred dollar bill in his hand
Said, "I could feed a lot of these people with this
But that ain't the business at hand"
Ain't but one reason for a white boy
To be over on this side of town
He gave that money to the man
And he bought a little mercy for now

[Chorus]
Have mercy on me
Have mercy on me
I'm a sinner Lord, can't you see?
Have mercy on me

[Verse]
Old Joe don't know how it got started
I guess it was the fire in her eyes
He loved his wife and children
And he wasn't into telling all these lies
But she gave herself so freely
In that room at the top of the stairs
He'd go to her in hopes
He'd find a little mercy there

[Chorus]
Have mercy on me
Have mercy on me
I'm a sinner Lord, can't you see?
Have mercy on me

[Bridge]
Tears were made to fall
Hearts made to break
Sometimes it feels like they just want to know
How much you can take

[Verse]
She was all alone that evening
What was she thinking about?
Her mind was made up
And I guess it was the only way out
There's a pistol in a pawn shop window
Made of cold, blue steel
She took it home to find out
How warm a little mercy could feel

[Chorus]
Have mercy on me
Have mercy on me
I'm a sinner Lord, can't you see?
Have mercy on me

[Chorus]
Have mercy on me
Have mercy on me
I'm a sinner Lord, can't you see?
Have mercy on me

[Outro]
God knows that mercy ain't free
Have mercy on me

 

[Verse 1]
It's late at night
You're all alone
Pale moonlight
Cold as snow
Heart beats fast
Time moves slow
Strangers glance
Does he know?

[Chorus]
Where you going to run to?
Where you going to hide?
Where you going to run to?
Where you going to hide?
Where you going to run to?
Where you going to hide
When the people find out
That you lied?

Where you going to run to?
Where you going to hide?
Where you going to run to?
Where you going to hide?
Where you going to run to?
Where you going to hide
When the people find out
That you lied?

[Verse 2]
They took you in
Made you well
I told you things
They never tell
To pay the debt
You made 'em fools
That's what you get
They trusted you

[Chorus]
Where you going to run to?
Where you going to hide?
Where you going to run to?
Where you going to hide?
Where you going to run to?
Where you going to hide
When the people find out
That you lied?

Where you going to run to?
Where you going to hide?
Where you going to run to?
Where you going to hide?
Where you going to run to?
Where you going to hide
When the people find out
That you lied?

[Verse 3]
When they run to the temple
And find that the treasure's gone
Do you think it's going to be a cross
They're going to nail you on?

[Chorus]
Where you going to run to?
Where you going to hide?
Where you going to run to?
Where you going to hide?
Where you going to run to?
Where you going to hide
When the people find out
That you lied?

Where you going to run to?
Where you going to hide?
Where you going to run to?
Where you going to hide?
Where you going to run to?
Where you going to hide
When the people find out
That you lied?

Where you going to run to?
Where you going to hide?
Where you going to run to?
Where you going to hide?
Where you going to run to?
Where you going to hide
When the people find out
That you lied?

 

[Verse]
I'm just a regular guy
Never get rich, but I always get by
I got me a wife and a couple of kids
I done pretty much like my daddy did
He always did the best that he could
Took care of Mama and us pretty good
He never got rich, but he never did try
He was just a regular guy

[Chorus]
Well, the world goes around and I can't stop it
So I sit back and watch the sun go down
If it comes back up, then this day's a good one
You know I wouldn't be that surprised
I'm just a regular guy
Never be rich, but I'll always get by
Never get rich, never be dry
I'm just a regular guy

[Verse]
I'm just a regular guy
And I'll work until the day that I die
I'm too young to quit, too old to hire
These days a man can't afford to retire
Didn't vote for nobody last time
'Cause they wasn't worth a trickle down dime
But one man's promise is another man's lie
And I'm just a regular guy

[Chorus]
Well, the world goes around and I can't stop it
So I sit back and watch the sun go down
If it comes back up, then this day's a good one
You know I wouldn't be that surprised
I'm just a regular guy
Never be rich, but I'll always get by
Never get rich, never be dry
I'm just a regular guy

[Outro]
I'm just a regular guy
I'm just a regular guy
Never got rich, never get dry
I'm just a regular guy

I'm just a regular guy
I'm just a regular guy
Never got rich, never get dry
I'm just a regular guy

I'm just a regular guy
I'm just a regular guy
Never got rich, never get dry
I'm just a regular guy

 

I was born in the city
I was born in the city
I was born in the city
I was raised up right around here

Daddy's down in the workhouse
Daddy's down in the workhouse
Daddy's down in the workhouse
Mama say there ain't no way he's coming back here

Went to school with some rich kids
Went to school with some rich kids
Went to school with some rich kids
Bussed me half way across town

They call us white trash and no count
They call us white trash and no count
They call us white trash and no count
Say there wasn't no use in me staying round

I'm going down to the corner
I'm going down to the corner
I'm going down to the corner
Don't you wait up for me to come in

Nothing happens till midnight
Nothing ever happens till midnight
Nothing happens till midnight
When the boys get restless about then

Sometimes I feel like I'm drowning
Sometimes I feel like I'm drowning
Sometimes I feel like I'm drowning
And I don't know what I'm going to do

I got a razor in my pocket
I got a razor in my pocket
I got a razor in my pocket
And I got a pistol hid down by the school

Lord, get me out of West Nashville
Lord, get me out of West Nashville
Lord, get me out of West Nashville
Lord, get me out of West Nashville
