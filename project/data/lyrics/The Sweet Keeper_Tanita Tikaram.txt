[Verse 1]
I might be politic
Or I might just grab your hand
I'm not selfish with my story
I just want something
Understand?

Oh, the world is not for grieving
It's not grieving for my cry
And I hate this growl inside, yes
I hate this growl inside

And you better believe it
When I tell you
That it's all growing
Until you learn to trust

[Verse 2]
Well, this wash it wasn't easy
No, this wash just doesn't dream
It just makes the whole thing cluttered, yes
And when you've seen the sights
It's best to scream

I'm not stolen from the soulless
I'm just driven to the white
So, you really ought to catch me now
You really ought to join the fight

And if I tell you
All my secrets
That you ever wanted to hear
It's:

[Chorus]
Once and not speak
Once and not speak
Once and not speak

[Verse 3]
No one wants to play this
Well, no one likes the dark
And we just checked in
For higher love
Well, that's another
You like sparks

Well, I'll fly across the evening
Least, I'll smile across the hall to you
But it better not [?]
It better just be wall-to-wall
And if I tell ya all my secrets
That you ever wanted to hear
It's

[Chorus]
Once and not speak
Once and not speak
Once and not speak

[Bridge]
I'm the tired recluse, yes
Tired of this courtyard
Every grateful day's [?] line

[Verse 4]
Well, the crafty were just leaving
They've forgotten how to talk
And that slither through the evening
Was just another kind of walk with me

Well, I'll tell you what you wanted
Least, I'll stunt you with my grace
And I know it's all so easy
But I just want to find your face
And if I tell you all my secrets
That you ever wanted to hear
It's:

[Chorus]
Once and not speak
Once and not speak
Once and not speak

 

[Verse 1]
You know it's alright
Just to take me home
To your serious house
With your serious tones

You're a serious man
With a serious smile
But the summer is hot
And I might surprise you

[Verse 2]
In a very short while
We'll have left them behind
With their faces quite pained
As they try to remind themselves

Oh, it's really so wrong
It's really so out
And it's really not cool
To take a young girl about

And I know the young man
With a century's face
A philosopher king
He will try to amaze

With examples of love
And examples of hate
And to see them explode
We will just have to—

[Chorus]
It's a simple love story
It grows better all the time
You can tell me all about it
But first I'll tell you about mine

[Verse 3]
You know it's alright
To be trustful; have tact
But the problem's complex
When you keep holding back

We could talk for an hour
We could talk for a day
But the people we know
Will still have their say

Talk of such virtuous women
Talk of such noble men
But if I'm on the level
I have met none of them

Oh, I've met troubled people
With deep and dark thoughts
Who have hallowed my name
And sworn I will get caught

But why waste real feeling
And why waste our time
To let the earth bow
To no virtue of—

[Chorus]
It's a simple love story
It grows better all the time
You can tell me all about it
But first I'll tell you about mine

[Verse 4]
You know it's alright
Just to make mistakes
But to tail it with hurt
Is the gravest make

We all create lives
Which we don't understand
But to point the accused
Is a job for no man

And we curse our own longing
And curse our own ways
I won't be satisfied
With my soul that's—

[Chorus]
It's a simple love story
It grows better all the time
You can tell me all about it
Now I've told you about mine

 

[Verse 1]
When the voice says
You should not stumble
You should not frighten
Or feel so ashamed
'Cause all the chores are light
And all the psalms are wiped

When you smash it
You make it easy
For when you want to
Stand alone

My friends are praying
For a good soft reason
For a good soft reason
To make them laugh again

[Verse 2]
I'll make you laugh if you want to
I'll make you smile at the footsteps
I'll make you laugh at the winter
And bring you back down to land

But if you stay on the wrong side
And if you laugh at the sunlight
I'm not asking for comfort
I'm just after the same

I'm just after the same

[Verse 3]
If you winced then
Why the man won't be coming
If you waste us
It's what we earned

And if you call soulless
About the beginnings
I'll call for easiness
Come back to the world

Come back in the open
Stand now by the root's life
Come out to show us
You'll be back home again

[Verse 4]
Now I'm not superstitious
About being so alarming
About moving with the changes
About holding your hand

Now I believe when they told me
It was all down to fever
It's all down to the harm that's
The harm that's in your hands

Harm in your hands
Harm in your hands

[Verse 5]
Now, I'm not saying that I want you
It's like taking your chances
It's like hoping for a straight line
When I'm falling into space

I'm just talking about the licence
That I'd like you to give me
That I'd like you to give me if
We all come out
Come in

Come on, dance
Come on, dance

[Verse 6]
I'm toting my whole life
And I'm toting the good side
And I hope you believe it
When I say I'll see you through

There's nobody will ache so much
There's nobody will ache so much
Ache so much for you

[Break]

[Verse 7]
I'll make you laugh if you want to
I'll make you smile at the footsteps
I'll make you laugh at the winter
And bring you back down to land

But if you stay on the wrong side
And if you laugh at the sunlight
I'm not asking for comfort
I'm just after the same

[Verse 8]
I'm not superstitious
About being so alarming
About moving with the changes
About holding your hand

Now I believe when they told me
It was all down to fever
It's all down to the harm that's
The harm that's in your hands

It's the harm in your hands
Harm in your hands
