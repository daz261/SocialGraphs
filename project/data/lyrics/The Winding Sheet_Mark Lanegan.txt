I feel your blood run cold
And it's a rainy Sunday morning
I count the million miles I'm driftin'
From here to hell today

Behind their windows people stare
Can't recognize the kindness there
Just prayers for drownin' ships at sea
None for me and you

It'll take a hard rain to wash your taste away
Still I wish there was a reason left to stay

I'm drunk half-blind
And it's an ugly Sunday morning
The wind arrives with the clouds
Refusing to break apart like me

Why if all the world's stopped turnin'
How can all this rain keep fallin'?
Washin' me a million miles away
From you

Why if I'm so alone now
Is it getting hard to say goodbye now?
Goodbye now

 

See through the eyes of a child and it won't be real
Eyes neither hateful or cruel no lies conceal
Eyes that wander, eyes that strayed
While the shame in your heart remains

Cryin' were the eyes of a child in pain tonight
Tears that I bled on you from the heart of an angel of fear tonight
We can wander, we could stray
But the shame remains

See through the eyes of a child and it won't be real
I have loved your eyes neither hateful or cruel no lies conceal
We could wander, we could stray
But the shame has remained, has remained
It has remained

 

I see they're comin'
Just tell me it ain't true
How lonely sorrow
And I fall back to you
One time or another
Like I want
She is alone
And I don't walk that tall

Memories amounting to nothin' I can't keep
Just as soon forgotten
Hate is all that her tears ever show
Saying sing well come on, black cat sing
Hate is gone, drippin' lies from the tongue
Demanding my all, well I don't walk that tall

I see they're comin'
Just tell me it ain't true
Head down in sorrow
And I stumble back to you
One time or another
You might find
Hate is all that her tears ever show
Sayin' sing well come on, black cat sing
I don't walk that tall
I don't walk that tall

 

My girl, my girl, don't lie to me
Tell me where did you sleep last night?
In the pines, in the pines
Where the sun never shines
I would shiver the whole night through

Her husband was a hardworking man
Till a mile and a half from here
His head was found in a driving wheel
And his body never was found

My girl, my girl, don't lie to me
Tell me where did you sleep last night?
In the pines, in the pines
Where the sun never shines
I would shiver the whole night through

My girl, my girl, where will you go?
I'm goin' where the cold winds blow
In the pines, in the pines
Where the sun don't ever shine
I would shiver the whole night through

My girl, my girl, don't lie to me
Tell me where did you sleep last night?
In the pines, in the pines
Where the sun never shines
I would shiver the whole night through

My girl, my girl, don't lie to me
Tell me where did you sleep last night?
In the pines, in the pines
Where the sun never shines
I would shiver the whole night through

 

Love you little girl
Better than I love my
Better than I love myself
Want you and me
Forever, ever and ever
Just so far from home
Just so far from home

Love you little girl
Better than I love my
Better than I love myself
Want you and me
Forever, ever and ever
Just so far from home
Just so far from home
Love you little girl (4x's)
