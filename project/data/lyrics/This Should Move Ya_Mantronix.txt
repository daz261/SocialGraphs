[Verse 1: Wondress]
Every time I close my eyes
I can clearly see the image of your smile
Shine through my darkest dreams
I never thought that I'd find myself this close, this close
To you, my dear, tell me what it means
I can feel your sweet caress wash away all the loneliness
That I once felt inside my heart
Boy, if you could read my mind I'm sure that you would find
What you've been searching for, what you've been searching for

[Pre-Chorus: Wondress]
Free me from despair (Free me), there's so much to share
If you surrender to me
Whisper in my ears words I long to hear
Woo ooh-ooh-ooh ooh-ooh-ooh ooh ooh

[Chorus: Wondress]
(Gotta find a way to get into your heart)
Boy, I got to have your love
(Gotta find a way to get into your heart)
You know, you know, you know I need your love
(Gotta find a way to get into your heart)
Boy, I got to have your love
(Gotta find a way to get into your heart, ha-ha-heart)
You know, you know, you know I need your love, ooh

[Verse 2: Wondress]
You're like an angel in disguise
I feel like I'm in heaven when you walk my way
You're such a mystery (Such a mystery)
The butterflies I feel inside must be (must be), must be (must be)
A sign of love, no one can disagree
My desire for your love is like a new horizon
Only lovers see like you and I, I
Sacred love will be the start to sacred nights, our hearts
I'll love you 'til my dying day, until my dying day

[Pre-Chorus: Wondress]
Free me from despair (Free me), there's so much to share
If you surrender to me (To me, to me, to me)
Whisper in my ears words I long to hear
Oh oh whoa whoa oh

[Chorus: Wondress]
(Gotta find a way to get into your heart)
Boy, I got to have your love
(Gotta find a way to get into your heart)
You know, you know, you know I need your love
(Gotta find a way to get into your heart)
Boy, I got to have your love
(Gotta find a way to get into your heart, ha-ha-heart)
You know, you know, you know I need your love
(Gotta find a way to get into your heart)
Boy, I got to have your love
(Gotta find a way to get into your heart)
You know, you know I need your love
(Gotta find a way to get into your heart)
Boy, I got to have your love
(Gotta find a way to get into your heart, ha-ha-heart)
You know, you know, you know I need your love
Free me (Gotta find a way to get into your heart) from despair
I want your love, got to have your love
Whisper (Gotta find a way to get into your heart) in my ears
Got to find a way to get into your heart
Tell me (Gotta find a way to get into your heart) that you are mine
Boy, I've got to have your love
(Gotta find a way to get into your heart, ha-ha-heart)
Free me from despair, yeah
(Gotta find a way to get into your heart)
There's so much to share
(Gotta find a way to get into your heart)
Whisper in my ear
(Gotta find a way to get into your heart)
