Friday (what you say?) Friday
Gettin' by, by the skin of my teeth
Out of phase - can't remember what happened last week
Stirrin' it up right down to the bone
A 100 miles and hour in a dead end zone
My life gonna live it - like I want to
Jump in, Hey what you got to lose
Come on baby ain't you heard the news?

I'm up to no good
No Good
I'm up to no good

Midnight, flyin' high with the double dose crew
Green light - paint he town till it's black 'n blue
Somethin' more than candy on the tip of my tongue
If you hand around the hive girl
You're bound to get stung
Hold on, we ain't stoppin' when the clock says no
Who cares, it don't matter anyway
Come on baby, let's put the night away

I'm up to no good
No Good
I'm up to no good
Se-Seven days seven nights baby
Wanna see just how far we can go
Ju-jump back watch out baby
I't s heatin' up and about to blow
I said ew ew ew get ready now
Ew ew there's a drty work to be done
City lights - up tight - do it up - do it in
Red eyed flyin' high - get it up and make it stick
Who cares it don't matter anyway
Come on baby let's put the night away

No Good oh - I'm up to
(No Good yeah up to no good yeah)
I'm up to (up to no good)
No good I'm up to no good
I said Thursday Friday here I come
Make it stick
Come on baby (No good) No good
Ew ew there's a dirty work to be done
Come on baby don't stop
Here I come rock the clock
(no good) Yeah!
Midnight flyin' high come on baby
Don't be shy
Hittin' with a double dose
Kickin' round from coast to coast

 

If I could leave today
You know I'd fly away so high
There was a time I thought
That every battle fought was mine

I used to think I, I could change the world
And never feel the pain
Oh, until I had to face
Arrows and chains
Arrows and chains
Heaven in flames
Arrows and chains

Used to line 'em up shot for shot
When I'd start you know I'd never stop
Be the first to take it
Always used to know where I belong
Always used to come on so strong
Now sometimes I fake it

I used to think I, I could change the world
And never feel the pain
Oh, until I had to face
Arrows and chains
Arrows and chains
Heaven in flames
Arrows and chains

Even an arrow can miss its mark
And every chain can be broken
But if I ain't winnin'
I ain't gonna lay down and die
I used to think I, I could change the world

 

Hit rock bottom
On a deep six dive
Like a fish outta water
Just trying to stay alive
Gun totin' blue boys
Out on the take
Settin' you up
Like fattenin' frogs for snakes

I said hey hey what do you say
It's gonna be alright
Hey hey what do you know
Hey hey do you say
It's gonna be alright
It's gonna be alright

Juke Joint Jimmie
Thought he couldn't be beat
Cruisin' round town
Like he was king of the street
Sirens Screamin'
The night came undone
Till some one dropped Jimmie
With his own gun

You can't get blood
From a stone
You can't borrow timne
That's already blown
Livin's so easy
When you're livin' a lie
But you can't swim the river
When the river runs dry
The river runs dry, hey

Just lookin' round here
Is makin' me sick
This town is tired and broken
And too late to fix
It's all comin down
Brick by brick

 

Woke up in Boston
First town I was lost in
Remember Edie
She stood right by me
And so I called her
Time hadn't stalled her at all
Don't you know we laughed the whole way
High and low
Next thing we were in L.A
-Never let it go

Met up with Pedro
Way up in Frisco
We drank all day
In the all-night cafe
It felt so right
So good to know nothing's changed
The bad new about Edie
Almost stopped the show
You know I'll miss her always
- Never let it go

Shot up and knocked down
Kicked up and turned round
Lost in a tailspin
Trapped in a no win
Sometimes life leaves you
Crashed down with no where to go
Just keep on believeing
Don't ever - forever and ever and ever
Don't ever let it go

It's all still out there
Out in the night air
Don't ever mind it
Lose it you find it
Just keep moving
It's all a heartbeat away
I'll see sweet Edie someday
That I know
Love always finds its own way
- Never let it go
