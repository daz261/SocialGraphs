[Intro]

[Verse 1: Paul Heaton]
Why don't you sing, 'I need you baby'?
Cause it rhymes with crazy and it rhymes with maybe
It rhymes with lady and much, much more
And it doesn't rhyme with the F word

Well, Simon le Bon stayed round my house before
And he was sick on the plants and he was sick on the floor
And he wouldn't go home until he'd sung his song
With a backing harmony from Paul Young

[Chorus: Briana Corrigan & Heaton]
Shall we dance again?
In our special way
With our trousers round
Our knees, our knees

[Verse 2: Heaton]
Why don't your videos have dancing girls?
With hips that curve and lips that curl
Legs are where that heartbeat starts
It's low in neckline and high in charts

It's the partially clothed for the partially sighted
Behind over matter keeps the crowds delighted
We want Rambo in a ra-ra skirt
Nastassia Kinski in a Brazilian shirt

[Chorus: Briana Corrigan & Heaton]
Shall we dance again?
In our special way
With our trousers round
Our knees, our knees

[Instrumental]

[Chorus: Briana Corrigan & Heaton]
Shall we dance again?
In our special way
With our trousers round
Our knees, our knees

[Chorus: Briana Corrigan & Heaton]
Shall we dance again?
In our special way
With our trousers round
Our knees, our knees

[Outro]
My knees, my knees
Oh, my knees, my knees

 

[Hook: Briana Corrigan]
You know your problem?
You keep it all in
You know your problem?
You keep it all in

[Verse 1: Paul Heaton]
That's right
The conversation we had last night
When all I wanted to do was knife you in the heart
I kept it all in

[Hook: Corrigan]
You know your problem?
You keep it all in
You know your problem?
You keep it all in

[Verse 2: Heaton]
Midnight
A husband getting ready to fight
A daughter sleeps alone with the light turned on, she hears
But keeps it all in

[Chorus 1: Corrigan, Dave Hemingway, & Heaton]
Just like that murder in '73
Just like that robbery in '62
With all these things that have happened to me
I kept them all in

So why do you keep on telling me now?

[Refrain: Corrigan, Hemingway, & Heaton]
Ah, ah
Ah, ah

[Hook: Hemingway]
You know your problem?
You keep it all in
You know your problem?
You keep it all in

[Verse 3: Heaton]
That's sweet
That conversation we had last week
When you gagged and bound me up to my seat--you're right, I do
I keep it all in

[Chorus 2: Corrigan, Hemingway, & Heaton]
Just like that murder in '73
Just like that robbery in '62
With all these things that have happened to me
I kept them all in

[Outro: Hemingway & Heaton]
I kept it all in
(Ba, ba-da-ba-da ba)
I kept it all in
(Ba, ba-da-ba-da ba)

I kept it all in
(Ba, ba-da-ba-da ba)
I kept it all in
(Ba, ba-da-ba-da ba)

I kept it all in, now, now, now, people
(Ba, ba-da-ba-da ba)
I kept it all in, ah
(Ba, ba-da-ba-da ba)

I kept it all in, now, now, now people
(Ba, ba-da-ba-da ba)
I kept it all in, alright
(Ba, ba-da-ba-da ba)

 

[Intro]

[Verse 1: Dave Hemingway]
I wasn't sure if it was Marx or Hitler
That was in this year
I hadn't been to Brighton for a while
So it wasn't too clear

So imagine my surprise
When I opened my eyes
To find it was the liberals who
Were hip to sloganeer

[Pre-Chorus: Hemingway & Paul Heaton]
I'm out tonight and can't decide
Between Soviet hip or British pride
I'm out tonight and can't decide
Between Soviet hip or British pride

[Instrumental]

[Chorus 2: Hemingway, Hemingway & Heaton]
So help me out
So help me out
So Blackpool, help me out; so Scarborough, pull me through
So help me out

[Verse 2: Hemingway, Hemingway & Heaton]
They wore enamel badges of
David Steel on their sleeves
And nuclear power, no thanks
Not sure and yes please

And their faces were two fold
And their teeth they were gold
And they wore their pinstripe suits
With a rip at the knee

[Pre-Chorus: Hemingway & Heaton]
I'm out tonight and can't decide
Between Soviet hip or British pride
I'm out tonight and can't decide
Between Soviet hip or British pride

[Instrumental]

[Chorus 2: Hemingway, Hemingway & Heaton]
So help me out
So help me out
So Blackpool, help me out; so Scarborough, help me out
So help me out

[Outro: Hemingway & Heaton]
Out
