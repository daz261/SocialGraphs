Hot tribal night
Underneath florescent skies
Bonfires rage strange
Wild waving shouting Picasso faces

In the guise of a lioness
The wind kisses her burning dress
You can feel her animal eyes
You can hear them cry
"Be the jewel around my neck
Never a tear on my burning dress"

Lying, paralyzed
A brave prey who lays dying
And is surrounded by angry spirits
Hunters, guns, drums, and elephants

Why is this night quiet?
Filled with trees filled with eyes
As she prowls around my feet
She throws back her head dress and cries
"Now you will be mine
Be my young lion"

Why is this night quiet?
Why the trees filled with eyes?
As she prowls around my feet
She throws back her head dress and cries
"Be my young lion"

 

I need to feel your heartbeat
So close, it feels like mine
All mine
I remember the feeling
My hands in your hair
I remember the feeling
Of the rhythm we made
I need to land sometime
Right next to you
And feel your heartbeat
Right next to me

 

Wouldn't it be great
To see the African plains
Before they lay them to waste
And only the bones remain?
Wouldn't it be poetry
To shoot holes in the poachers we see
With an elephant gun?

Men in helicopters fly
Shooting rhinos from out of the sky
Why do we always assume
The planet is ours to ruin?

What a legacy we're leaving behind
What a legacy

Wouldn't it be something
For the men killing dolphin
To be caught up by their necks
In their greedy fishing nets?
Wouldn't it be irony
If the tuna fish canneries
Were to fall into the sea?

The dolphins and the whales still left alive
Cry to the stars in the deep blue night:
"There's nowhere to hide
The people on earth will not be denied"

What a legacy we're leaving behind
What a legacy

Wouldn't it be odd
If there really was a God
And he looked down on earth
And saw what we've done to Her?
Wouldn't it be just
If He pulled the plug on us
And took away the sun?

Men in helicopters fly
Shooting rhinos from out of the sky
Why do we always assume
The planet is ours to ruin?

The dolphins and the whales still left alive
Cry to the stars in the deep blue night:
"There's nowhere to hide
The people on earth will not be denied"

What a legacy we're leaving behind
What a legacy we're leaving behind

 

Someday when I'm flying far away
Somewhere over Germany
Someday when you least expect
I'll be singing in your hair

Once upon a time in a different era
When great fat Cadillacs roamed the earth

Oh, it's a small world on a two-inch t.v
Yes, it's a small world on a two-inch t.v. screen
Small world

Someday when I'm lost in a dream
Out my window in the clouds
Someday you'll be doing your gardening
Hear me singing out loud

Once upon a time in a different age
Of drive-in movies and luxury trains

Oh, it's a small world on a two-inch t.v
Yes, it's a small world on a two-inch t.v. screen
Small world

Big doors opening
Big doors are opening wide
Glass of red wine
Wine...

 

"Hello, honey, I hope I didn't wake you up
But I had to hear your voice
I'm standing in another phone booth
Somewhere on the moon

I'm alright, I guess, except for all the stuff I miss
The things we used to do
I never knew I could be this blue

It's so quiet here
Like the stars are sayin'
"shh, be quiet"

So, how are the kids?
Did I miss his birthday again?
Aw, no...could you tell him I'm sorry
Sometimes my mind gets blurry
And I lose all sense of time

Time moves slowly
Like the curve of the earth

Aw, honey, I wish I really could
Reach out and touch you...but that's not real
Like the moon is blue...like this lonely view
From a sad phone...out here on the moon

And it feels like one long lonely night
You know what I mean
That's why I called"

 

Gunman, my sort of star, we put you there
You're all of us now, you're all over town
On wrappers and cans, you're bigger than life
You're braver than dad
You're a gunman, holding your own
You're a gunman, never alone

Gunman, leader of packs, shadow of death
Killer in chic, never betrayed, friend of our kids
You're a gunman, holding your own
You're a gunman, never alone

Gunman, trader in arms
The kids on the streets are buying your charms

Gunman, my sort of star
We're bleeding for you, we put you there
What would you give, you're all of us now
We're burning for you
You're all over town, gunman
You're on wrappers and cans
You're bigger than life and we're dying for you
And you're braver than dad, gunman
You're woman are dogs
But they're braver than you

We're bleeding for you
What would you give?
We're burning for you, gunman

We invented you
Now we've got to live with you
You're more solid than a rock
A rock of cocaine or crack or ice or death
Like a rock of death
Like a gravestone
Gunman
