[Verse 1, Lars Frederiksen]
Took the 60 bus
Out of downtown Campbell
Ben Zanotto, he was on there
He was waitin' for me
All the punk rockers
And the moon stompers
Are out on the corners where
They're sparing for change

[Refrain]
I started thinkin'
You know I started drinkin'
You know I don't remember too much of that day
Somethin' struck me funny when we ran out of money
Where do you go now when you're only 15?

[Pre-Chorus]
With the music execution and the talk of revolution
It bleeds in me and it goes...

[Chorus]
Give 'em the boot the roots the radicals
Give 'em the boot you know I'm a radical
Give 'em the boot the roots the reggae on my stereo

[Verse 2, Tim Armstrong]
The radio was playin' Desmond Dekker was singin'
On the 43 bus as we climb up the hill
Nothin' incoming but the reggae drummin'
And we all come from unloving homes
(I said) "Why even bother" and I pick up the bottle
Mr. bus driver please let these people on
Rude girl Carol was a mini-skirt girl
My blurry vision saw nothin' wrong

[Pre-Chorus]
With the music execution and the talk of revolution
It bleeds in me and it goes...

[Chorus]
Give 'em the boot the roots the radicals
Give 'em the boot you know I'm a radical
Give 'em the boot the roots the reggae on my stereo
