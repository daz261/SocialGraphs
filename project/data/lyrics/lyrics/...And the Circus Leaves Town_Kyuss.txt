[Verse 1]
One inch man, lonely soul
Two inch man (Two inch man), gimme more
Five steps and back, get him back
Three steps enough, get him up

[Chorus]
Always so lonely, lonely, lonely
Always so lonely, lonely, lonely

[Verse 2]
One inch man, lonely soul
Two inch man, gimme more

[Chorus]
Always so lonely, lonely, lonely
One inch man, he's so lonely, oh, he's breathing

[Bridge]
Damn my thoughts for you, do you really wanna fuck me?
Love my time for you, do you really wanna hold me?
Had my time for you, do you really wanna hold me?
Love my time for you, do you really wanna?

[Chorus]
Always so lonely, one inch man, he's breathin'
Always so lonely, lonely, lonely
One inch man, he's so lonely, oh!
