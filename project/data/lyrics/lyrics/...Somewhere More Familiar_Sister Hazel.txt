[Verse 1]
Finally I figured out
But it took a long long time
And now there's a turnabout
Maybe cause I'm trying

[Pre-Chorus]
There's been times, (I'm so confused)
All my roads (They lead to you)
I just can't turn and walk away...

[Chorus]
It's hard to say
What it is I see in you
Wonder if I'll always
Be with you
But words can't say
And I can't do
Enough to prove
It's all for you

[Verse 2]
I thought I'd seen it all
Cause it's been a long long time
Oh but then we'll trip and fall
Wondering if I'm blind

[Pre-Chorus]
There's been times, (I'm so confused)
All my roads (They lead to you)
I just can't turn and walk away...

[Chorus]
It's hard to say
What it is I see in you
Wonder if I'll always
Be with you
But words can't say
And I can't do
Enough to prove
It's all for you

[Verse 3]
Rain comes pouring down (Pouring down)
Falling from blue skies (Falling from blue skies)
Words without a sound
Coming from your eyes

[Verse 4]
Finally I figured out
But it took a long long time
And now there's a turnabout
Maybe cause I'm trying

[Pre-Chorus]
There's been times, (I'm so confused)
All my roads (They lead to you)
I just can't turn and walk away...

[Chorus]
It's hard to say
What it is I see in you
Wonder if I'll always
Be with you
But words can't say
And I can't do
Enough to prove
It's all for you
It's hard to say
What it is I see in you
Wonder if I'll always
Be with you
But words can't say
And I can't do
Enough to prove
It's all for you
