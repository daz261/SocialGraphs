Boys had better beware
You could seem to color your hair
Or on a wig, you already spent
All the dough to cover your rent

But not so cool, man if you care
For all the other boys caught in your bleach-job hair
And girls better beware
Boys, you better, you better, yeah

Boys had better beware
You could seem a wasted affair
And like a bitch, you already spent
All the dough you promised your friends

But not so cool, man if you care
For all the other boys caught in your bleach-job hair
And girls better beware
Boys, you better, you better, yeah

Aaaaaaaaaaah
Boys said
She had
Like, Gods hands
Amen

Oh man, its not fair
To all the other boys caught in your bleach-job hair
And girls better beware
Boys, you better, you better
