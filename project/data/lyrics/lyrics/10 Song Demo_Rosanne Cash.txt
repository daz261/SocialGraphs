If I were a man, I'd be so sweet
I'd give me everything I need
I'd be so glad to go this deep
If I were a man

If I were the moon, I'd hang so low
I'd bring sweet love to all below
I wouldn't change and hurt you so
If I were the moon

Well, it goes on and on forever
And there's just no way to know
I can change just like the weather
I'm as solid as a stone

If I were the wind, I'd blow and shout
I'd clean our souls and bodies out
I'd shake the memories from this house
If I were the wind

If I were God, I guess I'd know
I guess my friends would tell me so
It would be a heavy line to tow
If I were God

Well, it goes on and on forever
And there's just no way to know
I can change just like the weather
I'm as solid as a stone

Well, it goes on and on forever
And there's just no way to know
I can change just like the weather
I'm as solid as a stone

If I were a man, I'd be so sweet
I'd give me everything I need
I'd be so glad to go this deep
I'd change the way the whole world thinks
If I were a man
If I were a man

 

That was the summer that followed the spring
The sad anniversary of a thousand old things
I was letting them go

The words of Collette and a strange new perfume
The drenching my senses and filling the room
The heat from my body is a light in our eyes
First, a surrender and then we could fly
We were letting it go

We're blinded to the beauty in our own lives
But hours taken all I could get
For five or six hours in the month of July
The summer I read Collette

The time was aligned and we learned how to crawl
The bones were a prison and memory of all
If it weren't for the past, I'd feel nothing at all
And now I'm letting it go

It's more than survival, the lesson I've learned
For I've found salvation was quite a surprise
That was the summer that followed the spring
A new way of feeling a million more things

We're blinded by the beauty in our own lives
The hours taken all that I could get
For five or six hours in the month of July
The summer I read Collette

I found Paris a hundred years late
Call it sleeping in ??
My ear to the stone, I can hear her sing
??

I sold my silver to get myself there
To a room with a candle up three flights of stairs
That was the summer I let it all go
Fulfilling my body with my heart and soul

We're blinded to the beauty in our own lives
I was taking all I could get
For five or six hours in the month of July
The summer I read Collette
