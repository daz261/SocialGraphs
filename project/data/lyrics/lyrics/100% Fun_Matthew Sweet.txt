Look at you you're just as blind
Trying to grab your little piece of mind
And you want to hold it near
But you know you can't keep it
Say a little should suffice
But more than a little of you is so nice
And you give me what I want

Not when I need it (not when I need it)
Not when I need it (not when I need it)
Well I find it all the time
But Not when I need it

No two days are quite the same
I look at me life I really can't complain
And you come so easily

Not when I need it (not when I need it)
Not when I need it (not when I need it)
Well I find it all the time
Not when I need it

The feeling's getting out of hand
But I can't have you on demand
I can hang onto a dream
But I can't hold it

Late at night I'm filled with fear
That I can't take for granted that you'll
Always be near
And it makes me hate myself

To think I can't see it (not when I need it)
Not when I need it (not when I need it)
Well I find it all the time
Not when I need it (not when I need it)
Well I find it all the time
Not when I need it
