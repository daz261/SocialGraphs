River throat is calling
River throat is screaming
See this body, it cannot breathe
From this shit that you've given me
Taste my waters, take in disease
Watch, my lover, you rape me

And river throat
Says, All right
We'll cover up
Yeah, watch my waters rise

Now the land is angry
And the sky is closing, it's true
See this body, it's not my own
Tainted sores and human bones
Watch my lover, locked in soil
And now you rape me

And river throat
Says, All right
We'll cover up
Watch my waters rise, yeah

River throat
River throat
River throat
River throat
He says to me
He screams, yeah
Watch!
Ooh, yeah

See the water, see the stones
Float like flowers, bob, and glow
Power plants, they break loud makers
Into war, and yet we made them
River throat, calling
River throat, screaming

And river throat
Says, All right
We covered up
And river throat
Says, All right
We covered up
Watch my waters rise
Rise!
Rise!

 

You are the one with fingertip tongue
Scratching words on bone (bone)
You are the one with razor eyes
Cutting away at what I hide
You are the lead rain
That falls, hot and boiling
Working its way to bone (bone)
Wherever you are, I feel you
With me or not at all, yeah

Words cling like blades of ivy
Wrapping around my brain (brain)
You are the one with gun tongue
Blasting away at what I hide
You are the one
A writer of sorts
Slip off your weapons and ride
You are the one
The writer of songs
Certain surrender

Words on bone (bone)
Words on the bone (bone)
Words on bone (bone)
Words on the bone

Death wishes it could have me
Waits until you're gone (gone)
It, too, knows your words
And waits until you're gone (gone)
You are the lead rain
That falls, hot and boiling
Working its way to bone
Wherever you are, I feel you
With me or not at all

Words on a bone (bone)
Words on the bone (bone)
Words on a bone (bone)
Words on the bone, yeah

(Certain surrender)
Words on a bone
