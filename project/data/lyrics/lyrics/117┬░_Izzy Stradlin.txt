Well, long distance information, give me Memphis, Tennessee
Help me find a party that tried to get in touch with me
Did not leave a number, but I know who placed the call
'Cause my uncle took the message, and he wrote it on the wall

Yeah, help me, Information, get in touch with my Marie
She's the only one who'd call me here from Memphis, Tennessee
Her home is on the southside, high upon a ridge
Just a half a mile from the Mississippi Bridge

Oh, help me, Information, more than that I cannot add
Only that I miss her and all the fun we had
Marie was torn apart because her mom did not agree
Tore apart our happy home in Memphis, Tennessee

Oh, last time I saw Marie, she's wavin' me goodbye
With hurry home drops on her cheek trickle from her eye
Marie is only six years old, Information, please
Try to put me through to her in Memphis, Tennessee
