[Verse 1]
Well you look fantastic in your cast-off casket
At least the thing still runs
This 9 to 5 bullshit don't let you forget
Whose suicide you're on
I'm the one you trust
And the world owes you nothing
You really, really want it that bad
You gotta come get it
It's your life, go live it
'Round the corner, give it some gas

[Chorus]
If you want it that bad
Be a world class fad
Remember leave a trail of crumbs
If you want it that bad
You're a world class fad
Remember where you started from
Don't be sad
You're a world class fad

[Verse 2]
You wax poetic about things pathetic
As long as you look so cute
Believe these hills are starting to roll
Believe these stars are starting to shoot

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
And the pressures gonna build yeah
Higher and higher
Something's gotta move here
Ain't knocking on wood
You're foxin' the cove? Oh yeah

Don't be sad you're a world class fad

[Verse 3]
Well you look fantastic in your cast-off casket
At least the thing still flies
I believe this road is starting to wind
And where we're going, starting to hide

[Chorus]
