Whatever did happen to your soul?
I heard you sold it
To some old boy who lived uptown
Who could afford it
So what's gonna happen to you now?
Therapy... The pharmacy

Crazy
That's what you'd like to believe
But it ain't easy
When yer goin' crazy
Over the rainbow

"I think your story's jive," she said
There ain't nuthin' wrong with me
If I use it to get me some sympathy
Some ecstasy
A memory... I wanna remember me

Crazy about ya
Crazy without ya
Crazy
Over you

 

Uptown again
Nobody home
Feelin' surrounded
Should never left me on my own
Remember nothing, hypnotize
They say the eyes they never lie
Your eyes have failed you dear, deny
Deny, deny I know you'll try

Baby, untie me now
I'm ready to get down
Get down and move around
Baby, you cry too much
I'm tired of the sound
Yer such a baby

Uptown again
Throw me a bone
Feelin' surrounded
I've never done so well alone
