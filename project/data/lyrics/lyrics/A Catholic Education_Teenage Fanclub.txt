You wanna turn your back on everything
You wanna turn your back on everyone
Well I try

You wanna turn your back on everything
You wanna turn your back on everyone
Well I try

 

You never talk about it
If it's too involved
You don't wanna know
Let it go
Let it go

And in the morning sun
Everything is fine
And it's alright
Till you open your eyes
Open your eyes

You're thinking about yourself
Thinking about your health
Thinking about your wealth
The church is nothing
It's just nothing

You never talk about it
If it's too involved
You don't wanna know
Let it go
Let it go

And in the morning sun
Everything is fine
And it's alright
Till you open your eyes
Open your eyes

 

[Verse]
When I touched your skin
I feel I'll end up in deep with you
I'm not sure everything is fine
You're in my heart
But it's the feeling that it fell apart
Think of me, but don't believe that I was wrong

[Chorus]
When I switched off my feelings is when I lost control
Couldn't say what I was needing, something I didn't know

[Verse]
I woke up in bed
Felt sweat running down my head
And I remembered something you had said
You said, "Don't dream too long
'Cause when you wake up everybody's gone"
Find someone else to sing another song

[Chorus]
When I switched off my feelings is when I lost control
Couldn't say what I was needing, something I didn't know

[Chorus]
When I switched off my feelings is when I lost control
Couldn't say what I was needing, something I didn't know

 

[Instrumental]

 

You wanna turn your back on everything
You wanna turn your back on everyone
Well I try

You wanna turn your back on everything
You wanna turn your back on everyone
Well I try

 

Here begins eternal light
I guess if everyone listens
There's no one left to fight

In your heart, someone's there
I'm sixty-years old
With nothing left to say

What does it really prove
When you went away?
Seems the message is
Gotta serve the sun

Now you don't know
When to listen
Or just let it go

But then I don't suppose
That I should watch you walk a straight road
Then you'll never know

But then I don't suppose
That I should watch you walk a straight road
Then you'll never know

What does it really prove
When you went away?
Seems the message is
Gotta serve the sun
