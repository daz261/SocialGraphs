Can't seem to find no way out of here
But maybe I'm not even trying
Every day one thing becomes so clear
There is no point in denying

That I'm lost in your love
I'm so lost in your love

It's been this way such a long, long time
Oh, ever since I can remember
From that sweet moment when you were mine
On that cold night in November

I've been lost in your love
I'm lost in your love
I'm so lost in your love
So lost in your love

Can't seem to find no way out of here
But maybe I'm not even trying
Every day one thing becomes so clear
There is no point in denying

That I'm lost in your love
So lost in your love
I'm so lost in your love
I'm so lost in your love

I'm lost
I'm lost
I'm lost
I'm lost

I'm so lost
I'm so lost
I'm lost
I'm so lost inside your love
Inside your love
Inside your love
