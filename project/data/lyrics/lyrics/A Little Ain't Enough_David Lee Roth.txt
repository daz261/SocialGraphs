Smoked a cigarette and I know I've had enough
Mash whiskey in another paper cup
Didn't know it, babe, but your cup was running over
Never time to do it right, but it's time to do it over

And I lay awake
Big dreamers never sleep, no they don't
Time to play the cards
Read them and weep, oh

Well I, I always heard they say
That the truth will set you free
Woman with the way you do
Well how can I believe?

A smoking mountain got to blow
I'm the living proof
Well, right now I think it's time
To tell the truth, baby

(Time to tell the truth)
Yeah, you got to try
Stop lying baby
(Time to tell the truth)

Doing time behind these bedroom walls
Blink of an eye another shooting star falls, yeah
Tried to tell you babe, but you don't want to hear me
Take one good look, these are tears of fury

Went and let it show
A big catastrophe, yeah yeah
Now I don't wanna know
Your social activities, anymore anymore

If the world loves a bad guy
Well, then, how about the doubt
I was first one to get in, baby
I'm the last one out

Profess to love me, babe
Then what can I tell?
All you do is use me babe
You're lying to yourself

I think it's time
(Time to tell the truth)
Time to tell the truth, now now
Stop lying baby
(Time to tell the truth)
Time to tell the truth now, all right

Mama please
Ah baby please

If the world rogue loves a bad guy
Well then, how about the doubt?
Well, I was first one to get in
Now I'm the last one out

Smoking mountain got to blow
I'm the living proof
And now I know it's time
Yes it is

Try
(Time to tell the truth)
Yeah, got to try, try
Yeah, tell the truth now
(Time to tell the truth)
Stop lying baby
Uh uh, uh uh

(Time to tell the truth)
Woah, woah, tell the truth now
(Time to tell the truth)
Yeah, stop lying

Ah, tell the truth baby
(Time to tell the truth)
