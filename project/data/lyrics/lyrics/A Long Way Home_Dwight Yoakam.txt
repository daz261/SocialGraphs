I said "But I feel the same"
She said "well let me explain, baby how things can change"
I said "but that doesn't show, how a love that could grow
Would become so estranged"
She said "well baby things change"

She said "Na na na na na na na, now baby dont try
To figure this out or ask questions 'bout why
Forever's a promise no love can survive
And trust with hearts, just don't apply"
She said "Cause baby things change"

Na na na na na na na, so baby I quit tryin
To figure things out about all your hearts lyin'
Forever's a promise we couldn't survive
Yeah, I may be slow, but I ain't blind

She said "I still love you so"
I said "I don't care to know"
She said "You once cried my name"
I said "Well baby things change
Let's don't go placin' no blame
Cause you know things can change"

Cause you know things can change"
Na na na na na na, na na na na na na
