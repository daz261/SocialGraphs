Make believe we've landed
On a desert island
Bathe me in the waters
Warm in the moonlight
Taste me with your kisses
Find my secret places
Touch me till I tremble
Free my wings for flying
And catch me when I'm falling
Keep your arms around me
Like there's no tomorrow
Let me know you love me
On our little island
Not a soul can see us
Show me how to love you
Teach me how to please you
Lay your dreams beside me
Only stars will listen
To our cries and whispers
You were made to love me
And I was made to love you
Keep your arms around me
Lose yourself inside me
Make it last forever

I can see the island
Shining in the distance
Now we're getting closer
Keep your arms around me
Oh now we're almost there
Oooooh…

On our little island
Not a soul can hear us
Silently exchanging
Fantasies and feelings
Endlessly exploring
Learning one another
Till the morning finds us
You were made to love me
And I was made to love you
Keep your arms around me
Lose yourself completely
Make it last forever

I can see the island
Shining there before us
Now we're getting closer
Just keep your arms around me
Come my love, we're there…
