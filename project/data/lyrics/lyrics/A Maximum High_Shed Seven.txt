[Verse 1]
I never said never ever
You took the words right out of my mouth
Is the sea your sunshine? (Have we been told?)
The sea is your lifeline, you're a cold girl
You took the words right out of my mouth

[Chorus]
Time and time and time again
I look to me my only friend
Time and time and time again
Are you here for my pleasure
Or are you going for gold?
Are you going for gold?

[Verse 2]
I never said never ever
You took the shine right out of my smile
Is the moon your nighttime? (Have you been sold?)
The moon is your lifeline, you're a cold girl
You took the shine right out of my smile

[Chorus]
While my mind is blind again
I look to me my only friend
Time and time and time again
Are you here for my pleasure
Or are you going for gold?
Are you going for gold?
Time and time and time again
I look to me my only friend
Time and time and time again
Are you going for gold?

[Outro]
Are you going for gold?
Are you going for gold?
