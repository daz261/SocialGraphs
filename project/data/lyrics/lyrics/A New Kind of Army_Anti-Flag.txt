A-N-A-R-C-H-Y!

He says that for the punk rock scene he'd give his fucking life
But he only ever paid to see a show once, maybe twice
Instead, he stands outside the hall and panhandles for beer
Then sneaks inside the hall to deface the bathroom mirror

A-N-A-R-C-H-Y
His name is Captain Anarchy but only in his mind
A-N-A-R-C-H-Y
So punk that he's a poser and he'll be one till he dies

You never saw an anarchist with such perfect hair
Or so many ten dollar spikes or so much punk rock gear
He said he used his welfare checks to buy his boots and plaids
In reality it was all paid for by his mommy and his dad

A-N-A-R-C-H-Y
His name is Captain Anarchy but only in his mind
A-N-A-R-C-H-Y
He's anarchy incarnate but only in his...

You know he just can't see
OI! OI! OI! OI!
It's up to you and me
OI! OI! OI! OI!
I don't want to be
OI! OI! OI! OI!
Fighting, let's strive for some unity

A-N-A-R-C-H-Y
His name is Captain Anarchy but only in his mind
A-N-A-R-C-H-Y
So punk that he's a poser and he'll be one till he dies
