[Verse 1]
We're lookin' money and she's super clean
The fins are flying, sculpted silver gleam
Where is she going with a punk like this?
I like the looks it gets, I like the way it hits

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know that she'll be down
Wherever we go

[Chorus]
Down for a ride
Ready to drive all night
Ready to drive all night
With no place in mind

[Verse 2]
Tank's full or empty, I can never tell
Fucked up my g-whites parking parallel
Get in the middle and get in from my side
I like the shape of it, I like the way it fits

[Pre-Chorus]
And she never lets me down
Whenever we go

[Chorus]
Down for a ride
Ready to drive all night
Ready to drive all night
She likes when we go
Down for a ride
Ready to drive all night
Ready to drive all night
With no place in mind

[Bridge]
It always takes me to a place that I belong
Another time, another place that I belong
It always takes me to a place that I belong
Another time, another place that I belong

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know that she'll be down
Wherever we go

[Chorus]
Down for a ride
Ready to drive all night
Ready to drive all night
She likes when we go
Down for a ride
Ready to drive all night
Ready to drive all night
With no place in mind
