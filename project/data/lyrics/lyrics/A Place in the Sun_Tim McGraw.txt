[Verse 1]
Backseat of her daddy's car
I was trying not to go too far
Kept thinking about the words the preacher man said
Lightning flashed across the sky
I saw love in a young girl's eyes
And that's a look you never forget

[Chorus]
Seventeen only comes once in a lifetime
Don't it just fly by wild and free
Going any way the wind blew, baby
Seventeen, living on crazy dreams
Rock and roll and faded blue jeans
And standing on the edge of everything
Seventeen

[Verse 2]
Legs hanging off the Bayou Bridge
Feeding fish potato chips
And talking about the mysteries of the universe
Yeah, the world was somewhere else
We had the summer all to ourselves
And the stars went off like fireworks

[Chorus]
Seventeen only comes once in a lifetime
Don't it just fly by wild and free
Going any way the wind blew, baby
Seventeen, living on crazy dreams
Rock and roll and faded blue jeans
And standing on the edge of everything
Seventeen

Seventeen only comes once in a lifetime
Don't it just fly by wild and free
Going any way the wind blew, baby
Seventeen, living on crazy dreams
Rock and roll and faded blue jeans
And standing on the edge of everything
Seventeen
