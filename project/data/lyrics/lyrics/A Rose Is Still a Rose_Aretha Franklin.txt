[Verse 1]
Something is wrong, baby
Is the feeling gone, baby?
Maybe I need to refresh your mind
Think about the love we shared
Think back to the time we cared
Maybe you can find a reason to be here

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I'm the one who loved you, mmm
I'm the one who made it right
I'm the one who was there for you
On those cold and lonely nights
I'm the one who held you up
When the world came down on you
And I'm the one who's in love with you
And whose love never stops

[Chorus]
In case you forgot
I give love, ooh, and my love is so good
In case you forgot
I was there when you fell 'cause I care
In case you forgot
I left you satisfied all those nights
In case you forgot
I give love and my love never stops, oh...

[Verse 2]
Where did mine go? (Where did it go)
I never shoulda really let you know
You're about to make a big mistake
Now where do you think you find a love at all like mine?
Maybe all you're gonna find is heartache

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I'm the one who loved you
And I'm the one who made it right
I'm the one who was there for you
On those cold, cold and lonely nights
I'm the one who held you up
When the world came down on you
And I am the one who was there for you
And whose love never stops

[Chorus]
In case you forgot
I give love, Ooh, and my love is so good
In case you forgot
I was there when you fell 'cause I care
In case you forgot
I left you satisfied all those nights
In case you forgot
I give love and my love never stops

[Bridge]
Where will you go to find someone to love you like I do?
You can play anything, baby, 'cause you know that it's true
Sometimes a love like mine comes just once in your life
So you better, better take it, baby, and hold on tight

[Chorus]
In case you forgot
I give love, and my love is so good
In case you forgot
I was there when you fell 'cause I care
In case you forgot
I left you satisfied all those nights
In case you forgot
I give love and my love never stops

[Outro]
In case you forgot
In case you forgot
Remember me, hey, remember me, baby
In case you forgot
I was there when you fell 'cause I care
In case you forgot
I left you satisfied all those nights
In case you forgot
I give love and my love never stops
