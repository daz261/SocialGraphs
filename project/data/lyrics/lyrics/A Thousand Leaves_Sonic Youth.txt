Sunday comes alone again
A perfect day for a quiet friend
And you
You will set it free

I see new morning 'round your face
Everybody says it's another phase
And now
Now its come to me

See the magic in your eyes
I see it come as no surprise
And you
You turn your eyes away
Yeah you
You turn it all away

I guess its true its never too late
Still I don't know what to do today
Oh why
Can't I set you free?
Will you
Do the same for me?

Sunday comes and Sunday goes
Sunday always seems to move so slow
To me
Here she comes again

A perfect ending to a perfect day
A perfect ending what can I say
To you
Lonely Sunday friend
With you
Sunday never ends
