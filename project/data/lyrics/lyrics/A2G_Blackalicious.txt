[Intro]
We getting' ready, to start the set

[Verse 1: Gift of Gab]
It's clockwork, got work
Put it in like doctors with awkwardness
Mopped your whole flock and walked toward ya
Scattered all up on the chalkboard
Socrates self is thoughtless
From farmers to Metropolis
I get these process all twisted
Form mental visual optics
My job description rock wiz
Clock ticks, I'm toxic giving oxygen to the thoughtless
Intoxicant knocking the planet off its axis
Like oxes [?]
Boxing compin' up out though
Peepin it loose
Seeped in to you
Begin in to the outro...
MC is what I be about though
The freshest with or without though
I can outflow any little doubt your little mouth throw out so
Take it out though, so I'm a gardener
I'm a chef eatin' all you carnivores
I'm an ancient Zen master philosophic thought
Comin' like the Art of War
Handyman with lyrical hardware
And my house ain't made a ginger
But it's made of an array of pages that'll slay ya like a ninja
Unemployed, no, I got work
And my job description: a rap technician
From sunup to sundown
And it's clockwork

[Hook]
Do you understand?
Every beat he make
Which sucker DJ's persist to take
You understand?
Lyrics that I write
When put to his music sound out of sight
You understand?
Master of scratch
And if the needle was to slip it's the needle he'll catch
You understand?
The way he rock
Which is 24-oh-7 around the clock

[Verse 2: Gift of Gab]
Grabbin' the mic and unravelin' with
The force of a javelin hit
Travelin Gift of Gab and I'm it
MCs are havin a fit
A man and a myth with a hat of magical tricks
Stored in my cabina-net
Jammin' and rippin' the average listener
Cramming in it like a sandwich
A bit at a time
This critical rhyming individual shine your pitiful kind
It's little so little that I will belittle your mind
Nigero tearin' yo ego and spiritual flows
Divine imperial
Signed and delivered, so take time rewind and give it all
Your undivided attention
Divide is in division
Subtraction and addition
See I'm like a mathematician
Egyptologist wisdom
Hip-hop holy man submerging you all in my baptism
Security guard of the rap prison
Slap rhythms into newborns
And birth rap ism into blunts from sacks hittin'
Get 'em off and make fat dividends
Now that's livin'
See I got work
And my job description: a rap technician
From sunup to sundown
And it's clockwork

[Hook]
Do you understand?
Every beat he make
Which sucker DJ's persist to take
You understand?
Lyrics that I write
When put to his music sound out of sight
You understand?
Master of scratch
And if the needle was to slip it's the needle he'll catch
You understand?
The way he rock
Which is 24-oh-7 around the clock

[Verse 3: Gift of Gab]
Do I have to give up my signature?
To get ya to figure out
I'm walking the path that Allah had planted
Or Jah, whoever you give your shout to
If your doubts
Rip you out your physical, watch your spiritual drift up out
Floatin' up on your way to infinity, kiss the clouds
Just about
When you get to the point where the alien ships are out
Tell 'em I sent you to help ya and give ya directions
Wherever you're going so that you don't miss the route
See, I send you traveling far
Unadulterated cleverness
And you'll never catch a flaw
I'm a hip-hop astrologist
And my raps a shooting star
I'm a bartender all into your mental
Sittin' at the bar ventures, force injure
More injure pretenders the inventor of plenty other dozens
Your loving buzzin' at your door like Jehovah witnesses in the fall
If I was your landlord you wouldn't need to pay the rent at all
Just give me applause whenever I floss, that'll be the only cost
See my occupation: a rap technician
From sunup to sundown
And it's clockwork and it don't stop

[Hook]
Do you understand?
Every beat he make
Which sucker DJ's persist to take
You understand?
Lyrics that I write
When put to his music sound out of sight
You understand?
Master of scratch
And if the needle was to slip it's the needle he'll catch
You understand?
The way he rock
Which is 24-oh-7 around the clock

 

[Chorus]
Homeboys take time and elevate your mind
We came to rock the spot, rock the spot
Homegirls inside just let your nature rise
We came to rock the spot, rock the spot

[Verse 1: Gift of Gab]
Now Gabby got the verbal
That'll get your little wifey out her girdle
In a session with me lightn' up a little herbal
Turtle shell
School individuals that listen to me
Word it well
Given to the rapper who is livin' through
Be heard and held in a high esteem
I get you drunker than your bourbon, ale, liquor, malt
My assault, learned it well
Turn the tables of time with my perception
Building staples of rhyme hear my reflections
"On a little" life I'm livin' in a universe with no beginning to it
So it ain't an ending and at times I get to diggin' into infinite subliminably spirited
A nigga with a gift and send it riveted from any
An indigenous stork has just touched ground
Rappers' organizations get shut down
Not that I don't wanna see my brothers succeed
But rap is like a sport, I dominate, so follow my lead
I be the G-I-F-T, test me hefty, left's be gettin' swung
Cruise like a jet ski
Up in yo apartment and plop on your couch y'all
Undisputed heavyweight lyrical southpaw

[Chorus]
Homeboys take time to elevate your mind
We came to rock the spot, rock the spot
Homegirls inside just let your nature rise
We came to rock the spot, rock the spot

[Verse 2: Gift of Gab]
It's like a lime to a lemon, fat rhymes, I assemble them
At times when I'm driven they shine, you remember
When divine forces within refine men and women
And I rhyme for a livin', not just for the scrilla
Man that isn't what it's all about, really now, valid clout
Bougie MCs I have arguments and fallin' outs with
About what it's all about, ain't about foamin' out the mouth
Like a walkin' tall can of Guinness Stout
Mad dog will shine when the battle cries soundin'
Ding-ding, hit 'em like bing-bing
Eat 'em like Peking duck with no seasoning, bee sting
With yo girl dressed in a G-string, she's swingin'
My way shorty and it sure looks good
I'm cookin up a batch of dopeness like a good cook should
I be the jack of trades, rappers pray
That I don't decapitate, half of they cashless asses
At an irate rate
Grade-A, top-choice lyricism
Hey, hit me with that shell shocked rhythm
One time for the funky rhymes I say
Two times for the beat and for my DJ
It don't stop

[Chorus]
Homeboys take time and elevate your mind
We came to rock the spot, rock the spot
Homegirls inside just let your nature rise
We came to rock the spot, rock the spot

[Verse 3: Gift of Gab]
I say we drop it on a (one) we drop it on a (two)
We comin' out (fresh), and we do it (for you)
You know the deal with Blackalicious, we don't play
(From New York, New York) to (streets of LA) to (Puerto Rico [?])
You know we leave the party wreckin' a disaster
For the new "millie", rain like a shower
Let it seep in your pores (can you feel it, the power)
Oh lord that's (funky)
Rock ya from the top and to the bottom (from the bottom to the top)
('Cause I grabbbed the mic) with the intent to get ill
A natural that you know who is (skilled in the field)
So slide to the side and (take it light)
And (throw your hands in the air) all night
(Party people in the place) I make 'em suffer
To the fallen MCs I'd be the (quicker picker upper)
(You're lackin' the vernacular) I'm rapping the spectacular
Attackin' wack amateurs and back stabbing salamanders
Creeping while I'm peeping on 'em (all of the time)
Before I used to hit the meetings it was (Thunderbird wine)
(Used to drink the Ole) now I drink Calistoga
Sober and I'm older, but the world is still gettin' colder (hold up)
The Gift of Gab don't stop (the way I feel now, I just got to rock)

[Chorus]
Homeboys take time and elevate your mind
We came to rock the spot, rock the spot
Homegirls inside just let your nature rise
We came to rock the spot, rock the spot
