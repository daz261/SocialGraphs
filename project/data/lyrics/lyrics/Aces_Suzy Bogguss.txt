My old friend said to me
That ain't being what I'm supposed to be
Well I don't know, could be true
I know I wasn't always there for you

And now you're ready to walk out
You're ready to run
Talk to me, can't you see
I would never wanna do what it seems I've done
You can't deal me the aces and think I wouldn't play
Don't let this be the reason you would walk away

The things you think I should do
I've never understood that part of you
You know I've tried to be a friend
But you feel undermined and hurt again
Now, don't let it convince you
Please don't take it to heart
Compromise and realize
You can never really run everything you start

You can't deal me the aces and think I wouldn't play
Don't let this be the reason you would walk away

And I guess I said I couldn't see
How things could turn out like they've come to be
And if I lied, and if I knew
I was only trying to think of you

And now you're ready to walk out
You're ready to run
Talk to me, can't you see
I would never wanna do what it seems I've done
You can't deal me the aces and think I wouldn't play
Don't let this be the reason you would walk away
Don't let this be the reason you would walk away

 

There's a young man that I know whose age is twenty-one
Comes from down in southern Colorado
Just out of the service, he's lookin' for his fun
Someday soon, goin' with him someday soon

My parents can not stand him 'cause he rides the rodeo
My father says that he will leave me cryin'
I would follow him right down the roughest road I know
Someday soon, goin' with him someday soon

But when he comes to call
My pa ain't got a good word to say
Guess it's 'cause he's
Just as wild in his younger days

So blow, you old Blue Northern, blow my love to me
He's ridin' in tonight from California
He loves his damned old rodeo as much as he loves me
Someday soon, goin' with him someday soon

When he comes to call
My pa ain't got a word to say
Guess it's 'cause he's
Just as wild in his younger days

So blow, you old blue northern, blow my love to me
He's ridin' in tonight from California
He loves his damned old rodeo as much as he loves me
Someday soon, goin' with him someday soon

Someday soon, goin' with him someday soon...
