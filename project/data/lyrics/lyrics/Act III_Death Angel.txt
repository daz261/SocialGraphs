Affectation was an early sign
Of a twisted mind
All virtues had faded away
Apprehension made her cold
But warm she was inside
The child within her died
And left her with a heart of stone

Surface anger was a thin disguise
Yet at night she cries
Behold the pain in her eyes
Degradation was a grind
Her true self left behind
Compassion you will find
Hidden by a veil of deception

And so the story goes
That's the way she chose to live her life
And anybody knows
The way it feels when you hurt inside
She's running from herself
The game of life in which she played

Looking back upon the early years
There was room for tears
But she chose to push them away
Condemnation was a vice
She chose to roll the dice
And so she paid the price
Misery was her only friend

Inner feelings were a neutral zone
Though she tried to condone
In a world she faced so alone
Her salvation came too late
And on that day she died
No one even cried
Forgot about the veil of deception

And so the story goes
That's the way she chose to live her life
And anybody knows
The way it feels when your hurt inside
She's running from herself
The game of life in which she played

 

Within the depths of darkness
Amidst the delusive fog
There waits a path to nowhere
Forthright be stepped upon
Walking through the heinous forest
The panic and rush of fright
She feels them coming nearer
Hereon will lead the rite

Shadows overwhelm her soul
Exceeding anxiety
Their shadows overtake her thoughts
Thick in obscurity

Organize to control
The power compels your soul
Organize to control
Speak the incantation
Follow the ordination
Enter the Organization

Convene outside the temple
Hear the responsive roar
The prayers of deprivation
Foretell what lies in store
Running from the grave believers
Try to evade the chase
They see she's growing weary
And now it is too late

Organize to control
The power compels your soul
Organize to control
Fall to your knees and crawl
Organize to control
The power compels your soul
Organize to control
Speak the incantation
Follow the ordination
Enter the Organization

 

Blurs of beauty have passed me by
Scenes have flashed inside my mind
Remembered places in memory alive
Forever moving onward

An endless space within you are
Black hopeless hole feelings are sparse
Seems your goal is gone devotion wanders far
Take a look back on your past

Happiness a feeling
So far surreal
Joy just a reflection
Of the fear you still feel

An aimless search through latent realms
The warmth is lost cold beings dead
Affection fatal love bonded to a bed
Release your inner self

Time is sacred until it ends
Never to stop so cleanse your head
Relax in peace I'll be happily content
Waiting to fulfil your fate

Happiness a feeling
So far surreal
Joy just a reflection
Of the fear you still feel
Joy just a reflection
Of the fear that you still feel

The conclusion
Provoke the end don't wait
Resolution
Do it now rearrange
Discontinue
And make...the change

 

I need someone to live for
Something to die for
Because this crazy life
Is getting to me
Don't want to play the part
Of a man with a broken heart
Somebody help me find a way
To release the aggression inside

It's so cold in this lonely room
Sitting around thinking of you
And I'm alone just talking to myself
Trying to find the answer but to no avail

Never moving
Never changing

Blank stares at the blank walls
Drill a deep hole in my empty soul

Never moving
Never changing

Life is just a game they say
And what if I don't want to play no more
Such a high price to pay
Come inside or get away from that door

We've got to make a change
We got to rearrange
Because this stagnant life
Is getting to me
Like a river must flow
It's time to let myself go
Nobody made me choose the life
I chose to live anyway

Forever moving
Forever changing

Blank stares at the blank walls
Drill a deep hole in my empty soul

Forever moving
Forever changing

 

Black covers the mass
The mist it's so dense
It's soothing to breathe
I reach out my hand
Into the sights
Yet I grasp nothing

All seems different to me
What I've seen before

Yearn for the feel
The warmth that's inside
A childish grin
I joyfully scream
To deafened ears
It's time to begin

All seems different to me
What I've seen before
Can't help but notice
Hidden feelings I had stored

You stare at me
As if I am strange
My eyes open wide
I feel the beauty
Of all around
Then run through the tides

Come into my place
There is great pleasure
In what you will find
I throw away hate
That's how you tell
X is on my mind

 

I'm not sure what's going on
Can't seem to cope I've gone beyond
Sense to me is obsolete
Can find a strength in a brief retreat
Sights and sounds they start to blur
These circumstances do occur
There's no hope I'm going down
Won't be long until I kiss the ground

I'm falling out
There's no lasting

Rock a bye baby
In your deep thoughts
When the night wind blows
It's time to rock
A life with no breaks
The child will fall
Down will come baby
No one cares at all

I'm not sure just what to do
Not up to me not up to you
Always been a different breed
Something like unplanted seed
Sorry but I just can't cope
It's not my fault but there's no hope
I shall not cry I will not weep
Just drift into eternal sleep
