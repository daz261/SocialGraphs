[Verse 1]

He knows he's leaving, not much time left
Holding on to his very last breath
I saw him last week, nervous and uptight
Losing sleep, stays up all night
Wishin he woulda used his mind and not rushed
To push in the bush but took his time
To get to know the girl he slapped skins with
Shared needles with
Wish he could go back, change the direction
But now he's got the infection
I spoke to him, gave him inspired words
I'm sure he's heard
Live by the sword, die by the sword
What's left, pray to the oh Lord
You can deny but the truth will unfold
Because the eyes are the soul

Eyes are the soul..
Eyes are the soul..

[Verse 2]

I look into his eyes, but he's so high
From the crack, he thinks that he can fly
He has problems he doesn't like solving
Takes one hit, and thinks the world stops revolving
19, his eyes full of tears
He hasn't smiled at least for a year
His mom is gone cause he was high one night
Robbed and killed her, because of the crack pipe
He's wanted by the law
Because he's robbed at least three grocery stores
He's lost, all control
Take a look, eyes are the soul

Eyes are the soul..
Eyes are the soul..
Eyes are the soul..

[Verse 3]

I look into her eyes, she's so young
But I know, where she's comin from
I've watched her grow, little girl down the street
White shirts and skirts with pleats
She cried, fear in her voice
Not knowing, she had a choice
Oh so sad, oh so lonely
If she knew that she's not the only
One in school that didn't use the caution
Facin, raisin a baby or abortion
Her mother said she had to leave
Who wants to be where a baby is not received
No ultimatum, she's goin to the G.Y.N
To put it to an end
She's learned a lesson I suppose
I can tell, eyes are the soul

Eyes are the soul..
Eyes are the soul..
Eyes are the soul..

 

Within the depths, of this infinite community
Emerges Lyte

[MC Lyte]
One by one they fall in the darkness
I'm glad, that I could take part in this
And I'm hoping, that you just might
Get together and Search 4 the Lyte
Finding the Lyte means happiness
It's the best and nothing less
So I'm waiting, at the end of a tunnel
Where happiness comes in bundles
But it takes time, to get to the Lyte
To get in the Lyte, to be with the Lyte
And I'm hoping, that you just might
Get together and Search 4 the Lyte

How you get there is this question
Honesty is my suggestion
But first you must be awakened
If you say you are, you're faking
One who has seen the Lyte doesn't have to proof
That they've been moved
They just let it be, let it rest
For that is the mental test
Within this, there's so much happiness
Sort of like lasting moments of bliss
Everyone wants to be so happy
Let me explain my theory:
Some type of grief you MUST experience
In order to appreciate happiness
Cause if you are always satisfied
Life will just pass by, you would've never tried
To get to the Lyte, to get in the Lyte
To be with the Lyte, to go see the Lyte
And I'm hoping, that you just might
Get together and Search 4 the Lyte

If you are not ready the Lyte can be BLIND-ING
And not worth finding
So for this you must prepare:
Stay awake, wake up, stay aware!
There are SO, many distractions
Those that see the Lyte, just a fraction
Those that don't, remain blinded
The Lyte is there, they can't find it
One by one they fall in the darkness
And it's sad, to take part in this
But I'm hoping, that you just might
Get together and Search 4 the Lyte

Now finding the Lyte is what's so difficult
And you can bet, that the results are
Splenderous, wonderful, yeah
What wouldn't you do?
Cause once you've seen the Lyte, been with the Lyte
Got to the Lyte, got in the Lyte
I know that you just might
Never ever wanna leave the Lyte
