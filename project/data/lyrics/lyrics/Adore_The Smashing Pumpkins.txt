[Verse 1]
It’s you that I adore
You’ll always be my whore
You’ll be the mother to my child
And a child to my heart

[Refrain]
We must never be apart
We must never be apart

[Chorus]
Lovely girl, you’re the beauty in my world
Without you, there aren’t reasons left to find

[Verse 2]
And I’ll pull your crooked teeth
You’ll be perfect, just like me
You’ll be a lover in my bed
And a gun to my head

[Refrain]
We must never be apart
We must never be apart

[Chorus]
Lovely girl, you're the murder in my world
Dressing coffins for the souls I've left to die
Drinking mercury to the mystery
Of all that you should ever leave behind
In time

[Bridge]
In you, I see dirty
In you, I count stars
In you, I feel so pretty
In you, I taste god
In you, I feel so hungry
In you, I crash cars

[Refrain]
We must never be apart

[Chorus]
Drinking mercury
To the mystery of all that you should ever seek to find
Lovely girl, you’re the murder in my world
Dressing coffins for the souls I’ve left behind
In time

[Refrain]
We must never be apart

[Verse 3]
And you’ll always be my whore
'Cause you’re the one that I adore
And I’ll pull your crooked teeth
You’ll be perfect, just like me

In you, I feel so dirty
In you, I crash cars
In you, I feel so pretty
In you, I taste god

[Refrain]
We must never be apart

 

[Intro]
Perfect
Perfect

[Verse 1]
I know we’re just like old friends
We just can’t pretend
That lovers make amends

[Verse 2]
We are reasons so unreal
We can’t help but feel
That something has been lost

[Pre-Chorus]
But please, you know you’re just like me
Next time, I promise we’ll be

[Chorus]
Perfect
Perfect
Perfect strangers down the line
Lovers out of time
Memories unwind

[Post-Chorus]
So far, I still know who you are
But now, I wonder who I was

[Verse 3]
Angel, you know it’s not the end
We’ll always be good friends
The letters have been sent on

[Pre-Chorus]
So please, you always were so free
You’ll see, I promise we’ll be

[Chorus]
Perfect
Perfect strangers when we meet
Strangers on the street
Lovers while we sleep

[Outro]
Perfect
You know this has to be
We always were so free
We promised that we’d be
Perfect
Perfect
Perfect
Perfect
