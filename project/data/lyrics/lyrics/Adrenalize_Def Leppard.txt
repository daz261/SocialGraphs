[Verse 1]
Hey boys, Miss Magic is back
No Hollywood waste or tinsel trash
A street kid, she's no stray cat
Heaven on legs, she's feline flash
Takes a good woman to play a good man
And no one plays like Heaven can

[Chorus 1]
She said, "Leave your name at the sound of the tone
Call you right back when I get home"

[Chorus 2]
Better watch out when we're all alone
Heaven is a girl I know so well
She makes me feel good when I feel like Hell
Heaven is a girl that I've got to have
And she makes me feel better when I'm feeling bad

[Verse 2]
Hey guys, Miss Magic is mine
No silicone smile, she's a vintage wine
Bombshell blonde, red lipstick on
Aqualine fine, she's a real wild one

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]
Better watch out when we're all alone
Heaven is a girl I know so well
She makes me feel good when I feel like Hell
Heaven is a girl that I've got to have
And she makes me feel better when I'm feeling bad
Heaven is a girl that makes dreams come true
Oh, no one does it good like Heaven do, no

[Verse 3]
She got the rhythm to drive me crazy
She got the rhythm of love
She said, "Leave your name at the sound of the tone"
The lights are out but there's somebody home

[Chorus 2]
Better watch out when we're all alone
Heaven is a girl I know so well
And she makes me feel good when I feel like Hell
Heaven is a girl that I've got to have
And she makes me feel better when I'm feeling bad
Heaven is a girl that makes dreams come true
Oh, no one does it good like Heaven do, yeah
Heaven is a girl that I've got to have

[Outro]
She makes me feel good when I feel like Hell
Heaven is a girl she makes dreams come true
And no one does it good like Heaven do, that voodoo that you do

[Bridge]
Give me some rock n' roll
Little bit of rock n' roll
It's got to be rock n' roll
Little bit of rock n' roll

[Verse 3]
A little bit of love goes a long, long way
Got to get it on if you really want to get her
Never ever wait it's a little to late

Oh, you love her like a man
She's going to feel a lot better
And that's a fact
