[Verse 1]
Hey
If we can't find our way out of these problems
Then maybe we dont need this
Standing face to face
Enemies at war we build defenses
And secret hiding places

[Chorus]
I might need you to hold me tonight
I might need you to say it's alright
I might need you to make the first stand
'Cos tonight I'm finding it hard to be your man

Hold me tonight
Say it's alright

[Verse 2]
Hey
More than angry words I hate this silence
It's getting so loud
Well I wanna scream
Bitterness has silenced these emotions
It's getting hard to breathe
So tell me isn't happiness
Worth more than a gold diamond ring?
I'm willing to do anything
To calm the storm in my heart
I've never been the praying kind
But lately I've been down upon my knees
Not looking for a miracle
Just a reason to believe

[Chorus]
I might need you to hold me tonight
I might need you to say it's alright
I might need you to make the first stand
Because tonight I'm finding it hard to be your man

[Verse 3]
Do you remember not long ago?
When we used to live for the night time
Cherish each moment
Now we don't live we exist
We just run through our lives
So alone
That's why you've got to hold me

[Bridge]
Hey
If we can't find our way out of these problems
Then maybe we don't need this
Standing face to face
Enemies at war we build defenses
And secret hiding places

[Chorus]
I might need you to hold me tonight
I might need you to say it's alright
I might need you to make the first stand
Because tonight I'm finding it hard to be your man
