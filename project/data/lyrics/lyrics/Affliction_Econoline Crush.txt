Nothing.. 16x
You say you're gonna kick it today..
Crawl out from all your dirty walls and make your escape..
Today you're going to face the rage, the cage, the prison you're in..
Verse-
Hypocrisies and lies I am, terrified inside I am..
Ooooh, I can feel nothing..
Dependent on my acts of sin and swimming in this decadence..
Ooooh, I can feel nothing..

No you'll never let me escape, I am your prisoner..
Something's gotta take me away, I am a prisoner..
Verse-
Hypocrisies and lies I am, terrified inside I am..
Ooooh, I can feel nothing..
Dependent on my acts of sin and swimming in this decadence..
Ooooh, I can feel nothing..

You take it for another day..
All the contradictions.. the indifference in me..
Today I'm gonna face the rage, the cage, the prison I'm in..
Verse 2x

I can feel nothing.. 4x
Nothing..
