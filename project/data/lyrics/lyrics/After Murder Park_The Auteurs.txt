In a basement flat lying undercover
In a head full of heights were a couple of lovers
And I'll buy you some energy I'll buy you a beer
Hotfoot it downtown
If you move I'll shoot

Land lovers
Terrified of the land
They are loved by the land
They are limited by the land
They are
Shunned by the land

I believe that some of the brothers
Have been mixing it with land lovers

Well I heard your old man was a radio ham
Picking up signals from unoccupied land
Government intelligence isn't what it was
Put a bullet in his brain
When he picked up a doodle bug lovers

Yeah
Terrified of the land
They are loved by the land
They are limited by the land
They are
Shunned by the land

Medicine men
Undercover
Espionage viva land lovers

Parasite to the state
Ãœber alles, super hate
Bad moon, bad moon, lie the body in state

And they cut off your legs
And they cut off your arms
And they make you a target
For american bombers

Land lovers
Terrified of the land
They are loved by the land
They are limited by the land
They are
Shunned by the land

I believe that some of the brothers
Have been mixing it with land lovers
