When it's time to leave this place
I'll follow what comes easy
Elude the human race
Discover what still feeds me

And if my interest is
Waning, I can't fake it
Your captive audience
Escaped for soul renovation

I know I might be wrong
But I'm sick of pretending
I've listened to you too long
And nothing's ever mended

You can stretch the truth
And patience wears you so thin
It's just as easy to see through
Your high self opinion

And I know I might be wrong
But I'm sick of pretending
I've listened to you too long
And nothing's ever mended

And I know I might be wrong
But I'm sick of pretending
I've listened to you too long
And nothing's ever mended

And I know I might be wrong
But I'm sick of pretending
I've listened to you too long
And nothing's ever mended
Nothing's ever mended
Nothing's ever mended

 

I'm not so good realizing
Who I can or cannot trust
It's best to keep what matters vague
With harmless lies I can adjust

I get a "d" for disappointment
Now there's nothing to regret
Everybody's good for something
At least you know what you won't get

I let you down again
What's another harmless lie between friends?
Now you can be disappointed
I thought I gave you just exactly what you wanted

I let you down again
What's another harmless lie between friends?
Now you can't be disappointed
I thought I gave you just exactly what you wanted

I let you down again
What's another harmless lie between friends?
Now you can't be disappointed
I thought I gave you just exactly what you wanted
