Lascivious
It's all that I can think of
As I drag my feet searching like Diogenes
Dangerous
The adjective of the decade
And of your alluring intricacies

Yes, I see your green-screen mentality
And I feel the sting of its consequence
And I know I shouldn't but it's too much too ignore
An emotion I deplore

Every time I look at you, I just want to do it
I can clench my fist right through it
But I just want to get off

Rectilinear
The direction we've been heading
Never realizing we are on a runaway machine
Angular
The momentum that does turn us one step further on our ladder
One more turn toward the east

I realize your green-screen mentality
And I know it is shared by many more
I know it is quite impossible but I am damned to find a way
To revolve the other way

Every time I scrutinize I just say, "Screw it!"
On a ride down a blind conduit
And I just want to get off

 

[Verse 1]
Flying through a dark prismatic tunnel on a carousel
The earth is turning and you know it very well
Your mind is reeling like ten helicopters wheeling
And you're gonna hit the ceiling like a mallet on a bell

[Chorus 1]
Hey, Blenderhead, they're starting to ask questions
Your transgressions are a danger flashing sign
Challenge conventions and radiate your splendor
And feel those flywheels churn your blender head, yeah

[Verse 2]
Tally up the gleaming tender ventured on a wishing well
Each shining trinket has a story it can tell
Your moments pining like those tales all intertwining
Can become the rusted lining of a deep neglected shell

[Chorus 2]
Hey, Blenderhead, you ask so many questions
Your confusion's a life-affirming sign
Break from tradition and carry on with valor
And feel those flywheels churn your blender head, yeah
