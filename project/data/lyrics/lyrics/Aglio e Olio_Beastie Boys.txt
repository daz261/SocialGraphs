And I thought it was known
All good in the zone
Something you don't have to tell me
Something you don't have to sell me

I'm feeling so, I'm feeling so
I'm feeling so, I'm feeling so

Believe in me, believe in me
Believe in me, believe in me

And what wasn't said
I wasn't lying
What do I have to do
It's not lack of trying

What I don't know, what I don't know
What I don't know, what I don't know

Believe in me, believe in me
Believe in me, believe in me
