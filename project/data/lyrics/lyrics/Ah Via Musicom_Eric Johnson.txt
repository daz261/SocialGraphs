Close my eyes, see your reflection
In my life, you always are
Now I know, my true direction
'Cause I see, your shining star

Call out my name
When you do, I will let you know
Now my attention's on you
I was down on the ground
But I don't need to think about it
Nothing can keep me from you

Been so long, to get the reception
Of your smile, I keep in view
And all your love, and your sweet affection
Makes me feel, so close to you

Call out my name
When you do, I will let you know
Now my attention's on you
I was down on the ground
But I don't need to think about it
Nothing can keep me from you

Just call out my name
When you do, I will let you know
Now my attention's on you
I was down on the ground
But I don't need to think about it
Nothing can keep me from you

Say nothing can keep me from you
If you could just, give me one more try
'Cause I'm down on my knees
And I hope, there's no hang about it
Nothing should keep me from you
I'm gonna get to you
Ooh-ooh
Yeah!
