I've been walking these mean streets
Hard concrete beneath my feet
Ain't found a friendly face among the crowd
The city's like a Christmas tree
A light for every dreamer's dream
But it seems mine has finally burned out

Long black train take me home
I've worn out my welcome here it's time to go
I have to face the music this just ain't where I belong
Long black train take me home

I should've known I was mistaken
When I thought that I'd be making
A name for myself in Babylon
Though I've tried to do my best
The suit and ties are not impressed
So with what's left of my pride I'll carry on

Long black train take me home
I've worn out my welcome here it's time to go
I have to face the music this just ain't where I belong
Long black train take me home

I'm gonna trade my guitar for a ticket
Then climb aboard and ride you down the track
I know I'm licked but it's hard to admit it
Maybe some day you can bring me back

Long black train take me home
I've worn out my welcome here it's time to go
I have to face the music this just ain't where I belong
Long black train take me home

Long black train take me home

 

Are you going to Alabama
Where the trees grow tall and green?
I'd like to see the Gulf of Mexico
If you're going won't you take me?

Are you going to Alabama
Where the skies shine bright and blue?
I'd like to see the old Tombigbee
If you're going I'm going with you

Are you going to Alabama
Where the folks say how do you do?
I'd like to see those big ol' cotton fields
If you're going I'm going too

I'm ready to run, baby
Through the sweet southern pines
Lie down in a bed of Camellia
And watch the sun shine

If you're going to Alabama
I could use a change of view
But if you're going to California
That's alright, any place will do

Well I guess I just wanna go with you
