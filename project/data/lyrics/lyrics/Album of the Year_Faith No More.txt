[Verse 1]
It's over today
The heat is gone
Time is gone
F for fake
I feel no wrong
Hide no wrong
I love this place
The lights....
Under this face
So dry....

[Bridge]
Only way to change
Give yourself away
Don't be ashamed
Next in line; close one eye
Just walk by

[Verse 2]
In these days
I'm breathing stone, crying stone
I'll win this race
I'll leave alone, arrive alone
Love this place
The lights...
Under this face
So dry...

[Outro]
Stripped to the bone
I did no wrong
Truth is my name
Give yourself away
F for fake
F for fake
F for fake
F for fake
Give yourself away
Give yourself away
Give yourself away
