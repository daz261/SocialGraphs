How do you sleep at night
'Cause I lie awake and burn inside
When I think of all the shit you've done
When I think of all the times
I've tried to understand your motives
But they are not justified
You're only thinking of yourself
But your choices, they affect all our lives

How does it feel to always think you're right
You're never wrong, it's not your fault
Well, who's gonna take the blame tonight
I'm lost again on I-10 but it feels like home to me
I don't know where I'm going, but I know where I want to be...

And that's away from you
I'm not your commodity
