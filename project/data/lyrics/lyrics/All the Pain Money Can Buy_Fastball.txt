Once I had it all planned out
My dirty fingers moved about
To make a mess of everything around me

I don't claim to know my way
I still run in circles every day
Running around half blind
Life can be unkind

But it's better than it was
It's better than it was
It's better than it was
I complain very little becuase
It's better than it was

I get to remembering
We had a lot more money then
To make a mess of everything around us

Now the money comes and goes
A bit faster than my confidence grows
Everybody knows
There ain't nothing new about money woes

It's better than it was
It's better than it was
It's better than we ever could have wished it to before
It was bad awhile ago, better this I know
It's better than it was

But it's better than it was
It's better than it was
It's better than it was
I complain very little becuase
It's better than it was
It's better than it was
Better than it was...
