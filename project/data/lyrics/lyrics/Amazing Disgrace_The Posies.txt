When I told you what you wanted to know
You said, "Take me to Ontario"
When I showed you what you wanted to see
You said, "The flower that you planted in me has gone dry," yeah
Big birds flying overhead, who gives a shit?
Big birds flying overhead, who gives a shit?

When I showed you what I wanted to build
And all the enemies would never be killed
There'll be a saint living under the stairs
So we'll be free of material cares
Black paint on the walls in summer, it's cool, yeah, it's cool
Black paint on the walls in summer, it's cool, yeah, it's cool

I wanna go, I wanna go -- to Ontario
I wanna go, I wanna go -- to Ontario

When I told you what I wanted to know
You said "Take me to Ontario"
When I asked you, "Why Ontario?"
You said, "It sounds good on the radio" -- go!

I wanna go, I wanna go -- to Ontario
I wanna go, I wanna go -- to Ontario
Black birds flying overhead, waiting for somebody to die
Black birds flying overhead, waiting for somebody to die

 

I remember giving up the gory details
And it left me tongue-tied (such an elementary sickness)
Now I don't want to think and I don't want to feel
I wasn't aware that this was part of the deal
When I put my finger on a greater expectation
But just my luck, I lack the patience of a statesman
And all of my language will fail to convey
That I'm terribly twisted around what I say
And the message I threw away

I don't have it now
I don't have it now
I don't have it now
I don't have it now

So I keep hiding and it only grows to hurt me
But time is wasting and I'm watching it desert me
I'm digging a hole and I'm making it deep
And I'm starting to question the hours that I keep
And the answer that I put to sleep

I don't have it now
I don't have it now
I don't have it now
I don't have it now

And so I'm writing with the hope that someone's reading
For all to likely runs the risk of me repeating
But I don't have the guts to prevent the decay
And I'm terribly twisted around what I say
And the courage that I threw away

I don't have it now
I don't have it now
I don't have it now
I don't have it now
