Rape, D.U.I., assault and battery
These are the things that'll bring you to me
Murder and theft and all of the above
You can bet your life I know what you're thinkin' of

I've taken you and I'll take your friends
Don't you worry we'll all meet in the end
'Cause life's a bitch and then you die
Trust me, baby, 'cause I don't lie

I'm the goddamn devil
This job pleases me
I'm the goddamn devil
And I do it for free

I know the story about your life
If you killed your brother or you beat your wife
And I'm here to punish you
You can't fool me 'cause I ain't no fool

The time has come to say goodbye
The end is here for those who cheat, steal and lie
There will be torture and there will be pain
'Cause this is hell, baby, die in the flames

I'm the goddamn devil
This job pleases me
I'm the goddamn devil
Satan, if you please

I'm the goddamn devil
This job pleases me
I'm the goddamn devil
And I do it for free

I don't care about you, don't care about your life
Don't care about your children or about your wife
I'm here to do my job so if you've broke the law
You're checkin' in with me and you can never leave

There's one way out if you dare
We'll make a deal, you'll grow your hair
As Satan's child, you'll start a band
And spread the word across the land

I'm the goddamn devil
I'm the goddamn devil
I'm the goddamn devil
I'm the goddamn devil

I'm the goddamn devil
This job pleases me
I'm the goddamn devil
Satan, if you please

I'm the goddamn devil
Better believe in me, only me
I'm the goddamn devil

Sweet suntan
