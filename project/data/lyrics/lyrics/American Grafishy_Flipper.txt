Once it starts you never see them
Once it starts there goes your freedom
Now you're standin' by the front door
You want it back and even more

It was once written that those
Who give the truth
Become the slaves of the receivers

Once it starts you can't believe it
Once it starts you cannot see it
Stripped of all but left with your senses
All tangled up in a useless adventure

It was once written that those
Who give the truth
Become the slaves of the receivers

Once it starts you never see them
Once it starts you cannot believe them
You've torn my heart right from my chest
It's time to give that subject to a rest

It was once written that those
Who give the truth
Become the slaves of the receivers

Once it starts you cannot forgive them
Once it starts you don't want to live then
All we needed was a little trusting love
We'll stand proud and rise above

It was once written that those
Who give the truth
Become the slaves of the receivers
