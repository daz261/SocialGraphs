[Intro]
(Whoa-oh! Whoa-oh-oh-oh!
Whoa-oh)
Go!

[Verse 1]
Inside a Wall Street mind a psycho lurks
Lines of cocaine cut in hell
Obsessive hands gently grab your neck
Compulsively you die
I hate people!

[Chorus 1]
(Whoa-oh! Whoa-oh-oh-oh!
Whoa-oh) Struggling to breathe, go!

[Verse 2]
The sweet asphyxiation and dismemberment
Sex puts me in the mood to make you die
Obsessive hands gently grab your neck
Look into sick eyes
I hate people!

[Chorus 1]
(Whoa-oh! Whoa-oh-oh-oh!
Whoa-oh) Struggling to breathe, go!

[Chorus 2]
A machine of penalty (Go!)
The sweet insanity (Go!)
Fade to black tranquility (Go!)
You're lookin' through the eyes of a Psycho! (Whoa-oh!)
An American Psycho (Whoa-oh!)
An American Psycho (Whoa-oh!)
An American Psycho!

[Post-Chorus]
Psycho

[Verse 3]
Inside a Wall Street mind a psycho lurks
Lines of cocaine cut in hell
Obsessive hands gently grab your neck
Compulsively you die
I hate people!

[Chorus 1]
(Whoa-oh! Whoa-oh-oh-oh!
Whoa-oh!) Struggling to breathe, go!

[Chorus 2]
A machine of penalty (Go!)
The sweet insanity (Go!)
Fade to black tranquility (Go!)
You're lookin' through the eyes of a Psycho! (Whoa-oh!)
An American Psycho (Whoa-oh!)
An American Psycho (Whoa-oh!)
An American Psycho!

[Post-Chorus]
Psycho!
Psycho!
Psycho!
Psycho!

 

[Verse 1]
Traded in my Bible for a little black cat
The time of armageddon's here
Some call me the son of the morning
God knows I'm the angel of light
I drink my water from a wolf's footprint
My soul's redemptive work of Christ
God knows I'm the angel of light

[Chorus]
Speak of the Devil, Speak of the Devil, Devil

[Verse 2]
Believers be on guard
Be strong and take a stand
The time of armageddon's here
Some call me the son of the morning

[Chorus]
Speak of the Devil, Speak of the Devil
Speak of the Devil, Speak of the Devil, Speak of the Devil
Speak of the Devil, Speak of the Devil, Speak of the Devil
Devil
Devil
