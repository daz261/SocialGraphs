Well, a fascinating sensation
No I can't even feel it
I just had to let you know
I can't conceal it

I was recently considering
Taking the pain with the pleasure
Just to find my way to the bottom of this
I'll have to dig forever, and it's no small measure

Lift up your veil of tears

Don't be disappointed, child
If your prayers go unanswered
We are not responsible
For these sad circumstances

Secret agents and freedom fighters
On those impossible missions
Better put your toys and games away
Maybe take the kids out fishing for a family treasure

In your early years
Behind your veil of tears

So frustrated
Get up anyway
So complicated
Changes every day

So the darkness fades
And the light, will come shining through

I heard the eyes that look to a better world
Always hide beneath the veil of tears
And you hide no more

Lift up your veil of tears
Hide no more
Behind your veil of tears

Now the executioner must be executed
No I think we'll set him free instead, watch him run

And you hide no more

(Veil of tears)

Lift up your veil of tears

(Veil of tears)

You hide no more

(Veil of tears)
