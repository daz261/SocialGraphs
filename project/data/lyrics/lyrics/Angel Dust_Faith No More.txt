[Verse 1]
Go on and wring my neck
Like when a rag gets wet
A little discipline
For my pet genius
My head is like lettuce
Go on, dig your thumbs in
I cannot stop givin'
I'm thirty-something

[Pre-Chorus]
Sense of security
Like pockets jingling
Midlife crisis
Suck ingenuity
Down, through the family tree

[Chorus]
You're perfect yes, it's true
But without me, you're only you (You're only you)
Your menstruating heart
It ain't bleeding enough for two

It's a midlife crisis
It's a midlife crisis

[Verse 2]
What an inheritance
The salt and the kleenex
Morbid self attention
Bending my pinky back
A little discipline
A donor by habit
A little discipline
Rent an opinion

[Pre-Chorus]
Sense of security
Holding blunt instrument
Midlife crisis
I'm a perfectionist
And perfect is a skinned knee

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
It's a midlife crisis
It's a midlife crisis

[Chorus]
