Early in the morning
Sometimes late at night
Sometimes I get the feeling that everything's alright

Early in the evening
Sometimes in the day
Sometimes I get the feeling everything's okay

Because everything
Cuts against the tide
When you're by my side

Play me a song
That everybody knows
And I bet you it belongs to Acuff-Rose

Children in the playground
Folks in the home
Anybody anywhere who's ever been alone

Because everything
Cuts against the tide
When I hear that sound

 

I've been searching
And you've been gone
Been looking for the shortest path
To the one that you're on

And I've already seen
All I want to see
Come on, let's take the long cut
I think that's what we need

When we were younger
We were strong
We felt a lot better
The things that we'd done

Now if it's to be
And if you still believe
Come on, let's take the long cut
I think that's what we need

If you want to take the long cut
We'll get there eventually

I've been searching
And you've been gone
Been looking for the shortest path
To the one you're on

Now if it's to be
And if you still believe
Come on let's take the long cut
I think that's what we need

We've been in a deep rut
And it's been killing me
If you want to take the long cut
We'll get there eventually
