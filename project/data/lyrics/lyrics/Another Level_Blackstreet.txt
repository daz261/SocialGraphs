[Intro]
Yeah
You know what?
I like the playettes
No diggity, no doubt, uh
Play on, playette
Play on, playette
Yo, Dre, drop the verse

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
It's going down, fade to Blackstreet
The homies got at me, collab' creations bump like acne
No doubt, I put it down, never slouch
As long as my credit can vouch, a dog couldn't catch me **** out
Tell me who can stop when Dre makin' moves
Attracting honeys like a magnet
Giving 'em eargasms with my mellow accent
Still moving this flavor
With the homies Blackstreet and Teddy
The original rump shakers

[Verse 2: Teddy Riley]
Shorty get down, good Lord
Baby got 'em open all over town
Strictly biz, she don't play around
Cover much grounds, got game by the pound
Getting paid is her forte
Each and every day, true player way
I can't get her out of my mind (Wow)
I think about the girl all the time (Wow-wow)
East side to the west side
Pushin' phat rides, it's no surprise
She got tricks in the stash, stacking up the cash
Fast when it comes to the gas
By no means average
She's on when she's got to have it
Baby, you're a perfect ten, I wanna get in
Can I get down so I can win?

[Chorus: Teddy Riley & Chauncey "Black" Hannibal]
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up (Bag it up)
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up (Bag it up, girl)
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up (Bag it up)
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up (Get up)

[Verse 3: Chauncey "Black" Hannibal]
She's got class and style
Street knowledge by the pound
Baby never act wild
Very low-key on the profile
Catchin' feelings is a no
Let me tell you how it goes
Herb's the word, spin's the verb
Lovers, it curves, so freak what you heard
Rollin' with the phatness
You don't even know what the half is
You've got to pay to play
Just for shorty bang-bang to look your way
I like the way you work it
Trump tight all day, every day
You're blowing my mind, maybe in time
Baby, I can get you in my ride

[Chorus: Teddy Riley & Chauncey "Black" Hannibal]
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up (Bag it up)
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up (Oh, yeah)
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up (Bag it up, babe)
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up (Get up)

[Break: Teddy Riley & Chauncey "Black" Hannibal]
Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo (Hey yo, that girl looks good)
Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo (Play on, play on, play on)
Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo (You're my kind of girl)
Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo (Hey yo)

[Verse 4: Queen Pen]
'Cause that's my peeps and we rolls deep
Flyin' first class from New York City to Blackstreet
What you know about me? Not a **** thing
Cartier wooden frames sported by my shorty
As for me, icy gleaming pinkie diamond ring
We bes the baddest clique up on the scene
Ain't you getting bored with these fake-**** broads?
I shows and proves, no doubt, I been diggin' you so
Please excuse if I come across rude, that's just me
And that's how a playette's got to be
Stay kickin' game with a capital G
Ask the peoples on my block, I'm as real as can be
Word is bond, faking moves never been my thing
So, Teddy, pass the word to your **** Chauncy
I'll be sending the call, let's say, around 3:30
Queen Pen and Blackstreet, it's no diggity (No diggity, no doubt, baby)

[Chorus: Teddy Riley & Chauncey "Black" Hannibal]
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up (Girl, you got it going on)
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up (Play on, play on, play on)
(Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo) I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up (Hey, ooh)
(Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo) I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up (Hell, yeah, babe)

[Outro: Teddy Riley & Chauncey "Black" Hannibal]
Yeah, come on
Becky in full effect (No doubt)
Lisa in full effect (Right)
Vicky in full effect (Uh-huh)
Tamika in full effect (Yeah)
Blaze in full effect (Right)
Ain't nothin' goin' on but the rent (No doubt)
Yeah, play on, playette (Play on, playette)
Play on (Play on), play on (play on)
'Cause I like it (Right)
No diggity, no doubt, yeah
Blackstreet productions
We out, we out (Right)
We out, we out
