[Verse 1]
The ends don't always justify the means
But I know what it takes to get what I need
I've got the cure when passive protest just won't do
Just flick my Bic as I hold it to the fuse

[Chorus]
Smash it up
Break it down
Bring it down
Down to the ground
Tear it up
Burn it down
Bring it down
Down to the ground

[Verse 2]
How long have we waited for the day
When they tighten their grips and we slip away?
The sound of breaking glass drives me back up
It makes me whole when I've been down on my luck

[Chorus]
Smash it up
Break it down
Bring it down
Down to the ground
Tear it up
Burn it down
Bring it down
Down to the ground

[Verse 3]
The ends don't always justify the means
But I know what it takes to get what I need
I've got the cure when passive protest just won't do
Just flick my Bic as I hold it to the fuse [?]
