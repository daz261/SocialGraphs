[Verse 1]
It's a chemical attraction I just can't slide by
Every time I look into my baby's eyes
I'm helpless, so helpless, so I surrender
There's a visual attraction and she's branded my soul
Simply can't deny it, she has control
I'm helpless, so helpless, so I remember

[Chorus]
She won't let me break away
She won't let me break away
I said break away, yeah
Ah yeah

[Verse 2]
We were working it though, baby, we had a groove
Movin' to the moment when we make our move
But it happened, something happened
And I'm not lying 'bout the pain

[Chorus]
She won't let me break away
She won't let me break away
I said break away, yeah
Oh yeah

[Verse 3]
I want the answer, I want my stuff
I'm dealing with a feeling deeper than love
But I'm helpless, so helpless, but I remember

[Chorus]
She keeps saying break away
Something's saying break away
Telling me to break away
Keeps on saying break away
