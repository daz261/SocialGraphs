Drawn towards these lands again
Seeking death and sacred soil
I ride the longing winds of my blackened soul
Growing stronger once I enter my empire beyond

Emperium
Behold my coming

The fullmoon ride above me
Enlightening my realm in a silvery glow
Yet the shadows crawl beneath my storming sky
Guarding treasures from forbidden light

I still remember
Though ages ago, it seems
The first time I entered the gates
The revelation of ritual death

By which I became divine
Sacrifice of the life I had among the flesh of the light

And now I enter again
Even stronger, yet amazed by what I see
In ecstasy, I mock the world

Emperium
Emperium
Emperium
Emperium

Suddenly I memorize
Asking what I left behind
Nothing
Can I ever comprehend?
Will my longing never end?
Never!

Drawn towards these lands again
Seeking death and sacred soil
I ride the longing winds of my blackened soul
Eternally

 

Close your eyes
And gaze into this realm
That I reveal
See where eternities are born
Close your eyes
Behold the powers of the broken seal
See the liars bound in thorns

Fear
And you shall fall
Weakness suffocates your will
Dare
Yet never fail
Wisdom guides the one
The strong who can defy
Death

So I speak
Though, am I heard?
Wasting visions on a world of blinded fools

Still I scorn
The vacant contradiction of life
If only to bewilder
The final truth shall speak my name

Thus spake the nightspirit

Nightspirit
Spirit
Embrace my soul
