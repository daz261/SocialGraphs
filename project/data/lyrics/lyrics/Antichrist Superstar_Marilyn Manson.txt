[Intro]
We would swoop down on the town
Kill everyone that wasn't beautiful

[Verse 1]
And I don't want you and I don't need you
Don't bother to resist, or I'll beat you
It's not your fault that you're always wrong
The weak ones are there to justify the strong
The beautiful people, the beautiful people
It's all relative to the size of your steeple
You can't see the forest for the trees
And you can't smell your own shit on your knees

[Pre-Chorus]
There's no time to discriminate
Hate every motherfucker that's in your way

[Chorus]
Hey, you, what do you see?
Something beautiful or something free?
Hey, you, are you trying to be mean?
If you live with apes, man, it's hard to be clean
(Ah, ah)

[Verse 2]
The worms will live in every host
It's hard to pick which one they hate the most
The horrible people, the horrible people
It's all anatomic as the size of your steeple
Capitalism has made it this way
Old-fashioned fascism will take it away

[Chorus]
Hey, you, what do you see?
Something beautiful or something free?
Hey, you, are you trying to be mean?
If you live with apes, man, it's hard to be clean

[Pre-Chorus]
There's no time to discriminate
Hate every motherfucker that's in your way

[Bridge]
(Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)
The beautiful people, the beautiful people (Ah)
The beautiful people, the beautiful people (Ah)
The beautiful people, the beautiful people (Ah)
The beautiful people, the beautiful people (Ah)

[Chorus]
Hey, you, what do you see?
Something beautiful or something free?
Hey, you, are you trying to be mean?
If you live with apes, man, it's hard to be clean
Hey, you, what do you see?
Something beautiful or something free?
Hey, you, are you trying to be mean?
If you live with apes, man, it's hard to be clean

[Outro]
The beautiful people, the beautiful people
The beautiful people, the beautiful people
The beautiful people, the beautiful people
The beautiful people, the beautiful people
