[Intro]
Yeah
Yeah

[Verse 1]
I am the plan
I am the man
Who tells you what, and when you can
I'm the old one that torments you
I am the voice that tells you to

[Chorus]
Don't get caught with your fingers in my pie
Mess with me and, boy, you're surely gonna die
If ever you're in doubt, about who or where I am
I'm here, I'm there, I'm everywhere
I am your Uncle Sam
Electric Uncle Sam

[Verse 2]
You beg me please
On bended knees
Not to sit among the enemies
If you feel like you wanna dance
Then step aside and take a chance

[Chorus]
Don't get caught with you fingers in my pie
Mess with me and, boy, you're surely gonna die
If ever you're in doubt
About who or where I am
I'm here, I'm there, I'm everywhere
I am your Uncle Sam
Electric Uncle Sam

[Outro]
Yeah
I am your Uncle Sam
Yeah
I am your Uncle Sam
Yeah
Electric Uncle Sam

 

[Verse 1]
There's a boy out 'luma way
Named Joe Eugene
He's one mellow-ass son of a bitch-a
He loves that wheat grass
And cold bean curd
He's one healthy-ass son of a bitch-a

[Pre-Chorus 1]
But late at night
He sneaks on down to the liquor store
For a bottle of sheep dip

[Chorus 1]
Natural Joe
Got an easy flow
Wherever he goes
They say, "Here comes Joe"

[Verse 2]
Joe, he's a happy man
And he won't do you wrong
He's one respectable son of a bitch-a
Now Joe ain't no patriarch
But he's smooth with the girls
He ain't no chauvinistic son of a bitch-a

[Pre-Chorus 2]
But late at night
He sneaks on down to the porno store
For a little bit of...

[Chorus 2]
Natural Joe
He's hanging low
Wherever he goes
They say, "Here comes Joe"

[Verse 3]
There's a boy out 'luma way
Named Joe Eugene
He's one mellow-ass son of a bitch-a
He don't like firearms
He don't own knives
He's one pacifistic son of a bitch-a

[Pre-Chorus 3]
But late at night
He eases on down to the video store
For a little bit of...

[Chorus 1]
Natural Joe
Got an easy flow
Wherever he goes
They say, "Here comes Joe"

[Chorus 3]
Natural Joe
Looking slow and low
Look, there he goes
Go, Natural Joe
