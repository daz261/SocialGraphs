[Intro: Flavor Flav]
And right 'bout now, we get ready to get live to this beat. We get live to this beat, so I want everybody in the house to help me count this beat down. Yo, later for that! We ain't count down nothin', know I'm sayin? We ain't count down nothin', 'cause the beat is too large for that, know I'm sayin'? The beat's too large...

[Verse: Chuck D]
When I get down, I give what go around
And when I cough, I do my best to cut it off
I don't claim to be a preacher, not paid to be a teacher, but I'm grown
I try to be a leader to the bone
Never could follow a man with a bottle
He's a baby with a beard and not a feared role model
And they ask me where I get it, I got it from my pops
With a man in the house, and all the bullshit stops
Then I sing a song about what the hell is goin' wrong
You never know if you only trust the TV and the radio
These days, you can't see who's in cahoots
'Cause now the KKK wears three-piece suits
It's like that y'all, it's like that y'all
In fact, you know it's like that y'all

[Outro: Flavor Flav]
Yeah, that's right straight from Bricktown, boy! Know I'm sayin? Freeport, LI, Roosevelt on the map, know I'm sayin'?

 

[Verse 1]
Land of the free, but the skin I'm in identifies me
So the people around me energize me
Callin' all aboard this train ride
Talkin' 'bout raw hardcore, leavin' frauds on the outside
But the bad thing is anyone can ride the train
And the reason for that is cause we look the same
Lookin' all around at my so called friend
Light skin to the brown, the black, here we go again
Homey over there knows Keith an, but he be thiefin'
I don't trust him, rather bust 'em up
Out goes his hand and I cough
He once stole from me, yeah I wanna cut it off
The black thing is a ride I call the nighttrain
It rides the good and the bad, we call the monkey trained
Trained to attack the black and it's true
Cause some of them lookin' just like you

[Verse 2]
Stayin' on the scene, sittin' on the train
See all the faces look about the same
There go the sellout who's takin' a ride like Cargo
Cause he deal the keys from Key Largo
Runnin' Nat narcotic, by George he got it
Takin' makin' the Gs erotic
And the fiends they scheme, so he can put 'em down
But his method is wreck 'em, I put 'em in the ground
Got the nerve as hell to yell brother man
He ain't black man better yet he's Pac Man
Known to murder his own, traitor on the phone
Ridin' the train, self-hater trained to sell pain
The master's toy, his little boy
Hard to avoid he look wit' it but he null 'n' void
Cause he ridin' the train you think he down for the cause
Cause his face lookin' just like yours

[Verse 3]
More of the same, insane who sayin'
I'm flowin' like nighttrain, runnin' the pain of the black reign
You look, you laugh, you doubt and go out
And I'm gone, but the bass goes on
To talk the talk, but walk the walk, the king of New York
Crack a lack, attack the black, to crack the back
Once again I test a friend with sincerity
Or consider him an enemy
Who am I to tell a lie, rather push the Bush
Hope the cracker gets crushed, I'm rollin' with Rush
Leader of the bum rush
Russian I ain't! Spreadin' like paint!
Lookin' at the pot I got and it's kickin'
But it ain't chicken, but it's livin' for a city, so sick 'n' tired
Of a scene buckwild
Piled in a file, senile or child
They said it never been no worser than this
I'm on the nighttrain, they hope ya don't miss it
Give ya what they got to give you, just go
You musn't just put your trust in every brother, yo
Some don't give a damn, cause they the other man
Worse than a bomb, posin' as Uncle Toms
Disgracin' the race, and blowin' up the whole crew
With some of them lookin' just like you
