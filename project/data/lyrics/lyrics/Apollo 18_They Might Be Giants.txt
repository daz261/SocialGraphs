[Verse 1]
Someday Mother will die and I'll get the money
Mom leans down and says, "My sentiments exactly
You son of a bitch,"

[Chorus 1]
I palindrome I (I palindrome I)
I palindrome I (I palindrome I)
And I am a snake head eating (Snake head)
The head on the opposite side (Snake head)
I palindrome I (Man o Nam)
I palindrome I (Man o Nam)

[Verse 2]
See that bulletproof dress hanging from the clothesline
See the medical chart with the random zig-zag
Now I'll help it decide

[Chorus 2]
I palindrome I (I palindrome I)
I palindrome I (I palindrome I)
And I am a snake head eating (Snake head)
The head on the opposite side (Snake head)
I palindrome I (Man o Nam)
I palindrome I (Man o Nam)
I palindrome I (Man o Nam)
I palindrome I (Man o Nam)

[Bridge]
"Son, I am able," she said
"Though you scare me."
"Watch," said I "beloved,"
I said, "Watch me scare you though,"
Said she, "Able am I son."

[Verse 3]
See the spring of the grandfather clock unwinding
(Egad, a base tone denotes a bad age)
See the hands of my offspring making windmills
(Egad, a base tone denotes a bad age)
Dad palindrome dad

[Chorus 2]
I palindrome I (I palindrome I)
I palindrome I (I palindrome I)
And I am a snake head eating (Snake head)
The head on the opposite side (Snake head)
I palindrome I (Man o Nam)
I palindrome I (Man o Nam)
I palindrome I (Man o Nam)
I palindrome I (Man o Nam)
