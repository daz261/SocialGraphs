I'm sitting in a dandelion den
Blowing bits of fluff into the air
To tell the time...
I welcome anybody passing by

(Do you ever come here with a friend?)
No, I've never found someone to share my rendezvous...

(Do you spend the time like me
Wishing that you could be free
Free from all you have to do
Doing only what you want to?)

Oh yes, of course I do..
(Ah ha, we thought as much)
Hang on... who are youse?

(We're the other members of the band)
And who invited you to sing along?
Go on, answer that!
(Well no one, we were only passing by)
Well kindly keep on going if you please
(But we're only trying to help you with your song)
But I don't want any help
(Oh yeah, what about the middle eight?)
Oh yeah!

Do you spend the time like me
Wishing that you could be free
Free from all you have to do
Doing only what you want tooo ooo ooo ooo oooooo
Aaah aah aah aaaah!
