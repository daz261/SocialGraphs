On my knees I'm crawling once again
On my knees I'm crawling once again
On my knees I'm crawling once again

I'm wild, I'm free
We're young
Why don't you come with me
Through the fields
Running, I fall
Won't you come back to me
Calling
Baby, We almost made it
Falling, hey

On my knees I'm crawling once again
You're high
My hands they reach
Won't you come down to me
Your eyes, They see I'm weak
So come on over
And lift me outta here
Calling
Baby, We almost made it
Falling

Calling
Baby, we almost made it
Calling, oh

On my knees I'm crawling once again
On my knees I'm crawling once again
On my knees I'm crawling once again

Ride 'em high

Oh, no no
Oh, no no
No no no, no no no no no

I'm wild, I'm free
We're young
Why don't you come with me

I'm wild, I'm free
We're young
Why don't you come with me
