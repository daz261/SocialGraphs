[Chorus]
You high-fiving motherfucker, you high-fiving motherfucker
You high-fiving motherfucker, you high-fiving motherfucker

[Verse 1]
You're just a walking billboard for all the latest brands
You've got no taste in music, and you really love our band
Your haircut is atrocious, it's been the same since '83
Your glory days are over, and so's your stonewashed jeans

[Pre-Chorus 1]
You crass fat-ass, you stupid steroid fuck
I'll bet you even named your grand prize monster truck
You want me, you can't pay, you want me, you can't pay
You want me, you want me

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]

[Pre-Chorus 2]
You crass fat-ass, you stupid steroid fuck
Hijack the pit you shit, male bonding as moose rut

You want me, you can't pay, you want me, you can't pay (x3)
You want me; you want me

[Hook](x6)
You crass fat-ass, you crass fat-ass

[Outro](x2)
You high-fiving motherfucker, you high-fiving motherfucker
You high-fiving motherfucker, you high-fiving

You! (x8)

You!
