Living for you
Is easy living
It's easy to live
When you're in love
And I'm so in love
There's nothing in life but you

I never regret
The years I'm giving
Are easy to give
When you're in love
I'm happy to do
Whatever I do for you

For you
Maybe I'm a fool
But it's fun
People say you rule me
With one wave of your hand
Darling it's grand
They just don't understand

Living for you
Is easy living
It's easy to live
When you're in love
And I'm so in love
There's nothing in life but you
