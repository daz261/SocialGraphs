What you don't understand is where everything's leading
When all of the signs you see still point to overload
As you reach out your hand, a shattered picture's receding
Like tail-lights along that lonesome stretch of broken road

'Cause you've been to the past and it's just a reminder
A recollection of faces that will never come to call
When you've cut through the mask
When you've been through the grinder
Sometimes you forget that you had ever been there at all

Up here in room 429
Yeah the world ain't so unkind
I want to take you to that empty room tonight

In the shadow of doubt, in the crush of an instant
Standing in the rain outside my door hand on your knife
When you reach a brick wall, there is still a decision
Always thought if I had to lose I'd surely choose my life

Up here in room 429
Yeah the world ain't so unkind
I want to take that empty room tonight
We'll tell the world outside the door
That we ain't never coming back no more
I want to stay in here til we turn off the night
Til we turn off the night

City breathes so softly, everything is sleeping
I am at the window silently watching
I can see you standing alone against the winter
I can hear hear you asking but the streets they are not giving
Don't look to the ocean, restless in its dreaming
Don't look to the heavens for they will tell you nothing
If living is for learning then dying is forgetting
Once we have forgotten the we can go on living

In a lifetime of hope, in a second of kindness
There is never a doubt that we are born and die alone
From within or without there's no way they can find us
When they knock at the door the lights are on but we ain't home
