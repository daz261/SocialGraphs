Cruel - what a thing to do
I've been cruel to you such a long time
And how can I hide my shame
'Cause there I go again
At the wrong time

And I know that it was just the fear of flying
And I know it's hard to keep myself from crying

But when my tears are washed away
You'll still be blind
Skin-diving
For jewels

You were a shining pearl
In a broken shell
Under moonlight
And I was cruel

And I know that it was just the fear of flying
And I know it's hard to keep myself from crying
But when my tears are washed away
You'll still be blind
Skin-diving
For jewels
Cruel - I've been such a fool
And I'll be missing you
Such a long time
I was cruel
