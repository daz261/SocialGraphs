It comes as no surprise he's taken by surprise
It comes as no surprise he's taken by surprise
That's the man, I say he's always ahead
The admiral is taking in his cock

It comes as no surprise he's taken by surprise
It comes as no surprise he's taken by surprise
That's the man who'll say, "It's your turn in the barrel"
The admiral taking in his cock

She walked into the Admiral
Looking for some work
"Show me what you can do," he asked
And she unfurled her skirts
