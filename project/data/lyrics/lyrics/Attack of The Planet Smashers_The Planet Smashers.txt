You sleep all day, and you sleep all night
You're all busted up, 'cause you got in a fight
You can't keep your job, 'cause you can't work straight
You try to pick fights, when you show up late
You get hostile when you're loaded
Your ability to tolerate is distorted
Can't control yourself when you drink
Try to start fights when you forget to think
Your eyes are all red, and your nose is broke
You think you're so cool, but you're blowing smoke
You'll wake up tomarrow all battered and brused
But when the night comes around, you'll be ready to cruise
