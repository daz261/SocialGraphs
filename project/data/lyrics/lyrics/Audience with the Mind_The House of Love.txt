Won't this body leave this mind
Can't this child decide to find
A reason why this soul might be subliming from another time
That's why I have, I feel
What some would say is a dangerous mind

Won't this lady leave this room
She's not dead, I'm not a tomb
My head's a rocket full of gin, but not quite dead
That's why I have, I feel
What some would say is a dangerous mind

What is wrong with anarchy
Is it so pretentious to search for freedom
And by that I do not mean the royal way
That's why this man won't say there is no better place than home
That's why I love my wife and I will never roam
That's why I have, I feel
What some would say is a dangerous mind
