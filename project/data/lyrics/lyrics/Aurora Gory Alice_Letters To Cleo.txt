[Verse 1]
Like a gaping hole in the universe, as obvious as anything
Could be, trip and fall pants at ankles as it
As it only possibly could be
It's a cosmic thing and it's all around me dangling
Like life above me, if you knew where it was headed to, I say
You'd be there already

[Chorus]
Can't tear yourself away, can you?
Can't tear yourself away, can you?
Can't tear yourself away, can you?
Can't tear yourself away, can you?

[Verse 2]
If I'm different now in a brand new light, so?
Darts in time, changed everything
I'm moving this, hurdle over that now as it only possibly could be
It's encompassing 'cause it's all around me
Dangling like you above me
If I knew what I was coming to
Make it stop already

[Chorus]
Can't tear yourself away, can you?
Can't tear yourself away, can you?
Can't tear yourself away, can you?
Can't tear yourself away, can you?

[Outro]
It's only right to think about
It's only right to keep it down
It's only right to throw your arms around it
It's only right to keep it to yourself
Just be sure to be sure that you're right
