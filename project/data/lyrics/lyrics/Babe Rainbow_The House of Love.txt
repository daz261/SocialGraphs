Untie my hands, you're the best that I've had
Close to the drains and the sewers in flow
Hold back from anger and freeze all your soul
Dive through the circle, describe what you hold
Cruel

Drink and dissolve through the lines in your hands
Write out of romance (the sugar in sand)
I failed when I tried to defend in my way
Walked from the gaze of a dog of a day
Cruel

I find when things are mine
Like cold chains and baby whines
Well, Henry says, yeah, Henry says
"It's Sue and I"
Crawl, and watch your knes!
Slide low, through any sleeze
And money says, yeah, money says
"You've got to do it slow"
Cruel

My theme is; loose the plot
Fuck around and drink a lot
And Henry says, yeah Henry says
"Do it wrong"
But I don't think this way
And I would never say
I've done the best I could
Cruel
