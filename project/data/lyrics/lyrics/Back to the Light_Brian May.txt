Far, far from the light
Hear the night creatures call
With the cold breath they howl
All the hollow hours they're calling you
I'll be there
No matter what you're going through
In the dark I care
I'm holding on, I'm hoping on
It's still the same old me inside

(Back to the light)
Back to the streets that are paved with gold
(Back to the light)
Back to the land where the sunshine heals my soul

Deep, deep in the night
When the world fills with tears
And the wind blows, colder and colder it grows
And the fire dims with the same old fears
I'll be there
Though maybe you don't hear me, babe
I still care
No matter when I'll still be there
When you make it to the other side

I'm going back -
(Back to the light)
Back to the light
Back to the streets that are paved with gold
(Back to the light)
Going back to the land where the sunshine heals my soul - yeah

On and on
Searching for a clearer view
Winning and losing an inner war
Wonder what we do it for
Though the road seems never ending
Hold on to the hope I'm sending through - yeah

No matter where you're going to
In the dark I care
I'm holding on - believe it
We'll be walking in the light
Because there'll be no place left to hide

(Back to the light)
Back to the streets that are paved with gold
(Back to the light) - yeah
I'm going back to the land where the sunshine heals my soul
Let me hear you, babes

Back to the light (back to the light)
Back to the light (back to the light)
Back to the light
(Back to the light) - yeah
Coming back with me

Yeah yeah

 

Love Token
(May)

Yeah - oh let me tell you now
Mama's in love, Papa's in love
It's such a shame they don't love each other - oh no
Oh Papa's in a jam, Mama's throwin' pans
The game's up - it's time to run for cover

Everybody's cryin' but they can't stop hopin'
Everybody's lookin' for the door that's open
Mama's makin heat to keep the old fire smokin'
Papa's hangin' on to his old love token

You got love but you ain't got style
You want your freedom but in a while
You're lost children but you know for sure
You gotta find out who your love is for

Oh baby life ain't what it used to be
You're tellin' me - not since you've been hangin' round here
Hey

Mama what you screamin' for actin' like a demon for
And hey mama quit wavin' them hands in the air
Don't talk to me that way
Well I don't see no reason to raise your voice to me
You put fat in the fire you got shit for brains
Well you don't give me comfort and a man's gotta get it somewhere
Well fuck you
Yeah well

Mama's hangin' on to every word that's spoken
But Papa's hangin' on to his old love token

That's what it is
Here it comes babe

Oh I don't wanna leave you Mama
Said I don't wanna leave you Papa

Long haired women gonna turn you to stone
You can't beat 'em - cos you need 'em
You gotta live - you gotta love
You're love token's gotta fit like a glove

Listen to the story 'bout the dream that's broken
You gotta keep a hold of your old love token

Oh I don't wanna leave you Mama (mama mama mama mama mama)
Oh I don't wanna leave you Papa (papa papa papa papa papa)
Oh I don't wanna leave
No I don't wanna leave
No I don't wanna leave
No I don't wanna leave you alone
But I'm gonna have to babe
