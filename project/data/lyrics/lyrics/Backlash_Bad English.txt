I can't reach behind your eyes
You always look away
You hide behind your alibis
And change your mind
From day to day
If there's something I can do
Then I'll be there
Outside your broken world
You'll see it's me who cares
Take me straight to your heart
Cause this time's real
And real lasts forever
I know where you are
Cause you know
I've been there before
Straight to your heart
I watch you move
And I watch you dance
I watch you drift away
And I'd give anything for you
And you know that's bad
When it gets that way
You can't go on like this
And I don't wanna fight again
I don't give a damn anymore

Right or wrong you're gonna let me in
Straight to your heart
Cause this time's real and real lasts forever
I know where you are
Cause you know I've been there before
Straight to your heart this time this time
Baby I know where you are
Cause you know I've been there before
Then maybe I'll break down the walls
And my love will go
Straight to your heart
Inside
Take me inside yeah
Straight to your heart
Cause this time's real and real lasts forever
I know where you are
Cause this time we're goin' all the way
Straight to your heart
This time
This time
Baby it's straight
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
This time it's straight to your heart
Oh yeah
Cause this time it's real

 

The first time that I saw you
You were dancin' on the beach
Poetry in motion
But you seemed so out of reach
And the waves
Were breakin' 'round you
In the California sunset

I made a wish to know you
And touch your golden hair
You turned around and looked at me
And paradise was there
Baby I remember the way you took my hand
Yesterday

Time stood still
As we walked into the night together
The memory is locked in our hearts forever
It seems just like yesterday
Time stood still

We found a little seaside bar
High above the rocks
You were drinking white wine
And I was doing shots
I wondered if you'd stay the night
You just took my hand and led the way

Time stood still
As we made love through the night together
The memory is locked in our hearts forever
Time stood still
Time stood still
The memory is locked in our hearts forever
Oh yeah

I thought that I'd seen love before
But what you showed me
Well that's something more
Love found two strangers walking on the shore
We threw our watches in the sea
I looked at you you looked at me
And time stood still

We made a fire on the beach that night
And watched the seagulls circle in the morning light
Maybe there are some things
We're not meant to understand Anyway

Time stood still
But love goes on forever
The memory is burned in our hearts forever
Oh yes

Time stood still
The moment's gone forever
But I will love you till
Time stands still in our hearts forever
Oh yeah

Time stood still
Time stood still
Time stands still in our hearts forever
Seems just like yesterday
Time stood still
Time stands still
Time stood still
Oh yeah
Time stood still
Forever...
