Hatred, a deadly disease
Is flowing through the veins of every being on the planet
Or so it seems, "maybe you, not me"
I see it clearly through the red film of my eyes that we must fight

Prejudice, our nation's biggest sickness
Is taking place before our very eyes
I'm just as guilty as the next and that I'll try to change
Unfortunately some aren't as easily persuaded so we fight

Fight hatred

This doesn't have to be a physical war
Erase the ignorance into which we were born
And yes this may become a violent fight
And we may never win but no one can ever say we didn't try

So we fight

 

I've got a million things going around in my head
And i never really paid attention to what you said no
And now i wish that i would have said goodbye
But its much too late, and all i do is give and all you do is take

Chorus
You've gotta look before you leap
And take a good look at your so-called friends
Yeah, thats the company you keep
You've got words coming at you from all directions
You gotta look before you leap
And take a good look at your so-called friends
Yeah, thats the company you keep - they got the words, oh yeah

There's a lot of things that were never said
And if we'd grown up faster then i would have stood up
But-i should have cut you loose a long time ago
But its much too late
And all i do is give and all you do is take

Chorus

Well, there never was a time when you didn't try to lord me over
Never was there a time when i felt bad for you
Whenever you had the chance, the way i see it
You tried to screw me over
Never was there a time when i wasn't there for you

Chorus

They keep flying their flags
But they're never gonna understand
