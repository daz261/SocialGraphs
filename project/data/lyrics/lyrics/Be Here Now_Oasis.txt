[Verse 1]
Everybody knows but no one's saying nothing
It was a sound so very loud but no one can hear
I got something in my shoes it's keeping me from walking
Down the long and winding road back home to you

[Pre-Chorus]
And round this town, you've ceased to be
That's what you get for sleeping with the enemy
Where angels fly you won't play
So guess who's going to take the blame for

[Chorus]
My big mouth, my big name
I'll put on my shoes while I'm walking
Slowly down the hall of fame
Into my big mouth, you could fly a plane
I'll put on my shoes while I'm walking
Slowly down the hall of fame
Slowly down the hall of fame

[Verse 2]
I ain't never spoke to God
And I ain't never been to Heaven
But you assumed I knew the way
Even though the map was given
And as you look into the eyes
Of a bloody cold assassin
It's only then you'll realize
With whose life you have been messing

[Pre-Chorus]
And round this town, you've ceased to be
That's what you get for sleeping with the enemy
Where angels fly you won't play
So guess who's going to take the blame for

[Chorus]
My big mouth, my big name
I'll put on my shoes while I'm walking
Slowly down the hall of fame
Into my big mouth, you could fly a plane
I'll put on my shoes while I'm walking
Slowly down the hall of fame
Slowly down the hall of fame
Slowly down the hall of fame

[Pre-Chorus]
And round this town, you've ceased to be
That's what you get for sleeping with the enemy
Where angels fly you won't play
So guess who's going to take the blame for

[Chorus]
My big mouth, my big name
I'll put on my shoes while I'm walking
Slowly down the hall of fame
Into my big mouth, you could fly a plane
I'll put on my shoes while I'm walking
Slowly down the hall of fame
Slowly down the hall of fame
Slowly down the hall of fame
Slowly down the hall of fame

 

[Verse 1]
An extra-ordinary guy
Can never have an ordinary day
He might live a long goodbye
But that is not for me to say
I dig his friends, I dig his shoes
He is just a child with nothing to lose
But his mind, his mind

They are sleeping while they dream
But then they want to be adored
They who don't say what they mean
Will live and die by their own sword
I dig their friends, I dig their shoes
They are like a child with nothing to lose
In their minds, yeah their minds

[Bridge]
But I'll have my way
In my own time
I'll have my say
My star will shine

[Chorus]
'Cause you see me I've got my magic pie
Think of me, yeah that was me I was that passer by
I've been and now I've gone

[Verse 2]
There are but a thousand days preparing for a thousand years
Many minds to educate the people who have disappeared
D'you dig my friends? D'you dig my shoes?
I am like a child with nothing to lose in my mind
Yeah my mind

[Bridge 2]
We'll have our way
In our own time
We'll have our say
Because my star's going to shine

[Chorus]
'Cause you see me I've got my magic pie
Think of me, yeah that was me I was that passer by
I've been and now I've gone
You see me I've got my magic pie
Think of me, yeah that was me I was that passer by, passer by
Think of me I've got my magic pie
Think of me, yeah that was me I was that passer by
I've been and now I've gone
Yeah
Yeah
Yeaaaah
Shut up!
