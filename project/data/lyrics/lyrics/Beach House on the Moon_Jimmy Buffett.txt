Missing link crouched upon a promontory rock
Trying to figure out his biological clock
No one around to announce his arrival
So he's got to get to work on his sense of survival

Oh, oh it's a dangerous world

Oh but in China they got smart real fast
That's where they invented the manmade blast
They lost a few fingers and some bamboo shacks
But they gave birth to a tribe of pyromaniancs

Oh, oh it's a dangerous world (dangerous world dangerous world)
Fire in the sky, lava in the ocean
Sitting around waiting for the next explosion

Back in the 50s they thought it made good sense
To teach all the school children 'bout civil defense
Don't be scared (don't be scared)
Do not cry (please don't cry)
Just dive under your desk and kiss your ass goodbye

Oh, oh such a dangerous world (dangerous world dangerous world)

It was a hell of a hustle
Paranoia promotion
Everybody duck and cover just waitin' for the next explosion

Where're you gonna be when it hits the fan
Got a plan
Whatcha gonna do if it lands on you
Where's your point of view

Down at the beach club there's a sales convention
Night sky is the focus of that crowd's attention
It's no cosmic collision just a fireworks show
But they feel it in their hearts when those concussion bombs blow

Oh, oh such a dangerous world (dangerous world dangerous world)

Gunpowder's louder than Newton's law of motion
Everybody's waiting for the next explosion

Fire on the sky falling in the ocean
Sitting around waiting for the next explosion
(sitting around waiting for the next explosion)
