Like the spider spins the web
It goes back to your beliefs
What you said you never said
You're trying hard to find relief
It's not telling truth or lies
It's about convenience
To throw stones and you look stoned
Could you lie and mean it
You'd rock it if you were able
Can you hang with Judas Cradle
Rock me baby off to sleep
Now you've fallen in too deep
You'd rock it if you were able
Can you hang with Judas Cradle

My hands/ Means nothing/ To Me

Have you seen the Judas Cradle
Inbetween the Judas Cradle

As the point gets driven home
You lose your resistance
Splits you down the middle man
And increase the distance
You'd rock it if you were able
Can you hang with Judas Cradle
Throw me back into the fire
Peel the skin away from bones
As the smoke keeps rising higher
As the Judas Cradle moans
Have you seen the Judas Cradle
Inbetween the Judas Cradle

Could you rock the Judas Cradle
Can you rob the Judas Cradle
Hung upon the Judas Cradle
Fall upon the Judas Cradle
