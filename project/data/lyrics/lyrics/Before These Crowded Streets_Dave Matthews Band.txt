[Verse]
Fire
The sun is well asleep
The moon is high above
But fire grows from the East
And how is this
Hate so deep?
Lead us all so blindly, killing, killing
Fools are we
If hate's the gate to peace
This is the last stop
Oh is War
The only way to peace
Well, I don't fall for that
You're Raining tears
You're righteous, so righteous, so righteous
You're always so right
Go ahead and dream
Go ahead believe that you are the chosen one
Rain tears...
Oh no
Gracious even God
Bloodied on the cross
Your sins are washed enough
A mother's cry:
"Is hate so deep
Must my baby's bones
This hungry fire feed?"
Smoke clouds roll in
The symphony of death
This is the last stop
Scream
Right is wrong now
Ha, shut up you big lie
Oh and the "black is white" lie
You comb your hair to
Hide your lying eyes
You're righteous, so righteous, SO RIGHTEOUS
You're always so right oh man
But why your lie
Go ahead and dream
Go ahead believe that you are the chosen one
This is the best stop
Here there's always blowing up
And I hope that we can break it down
So it's not so black and white oh...
This is the last stop
Here there's more than showing us
And I hope that we can break it down
So it's not so black and white
Black and white oh man...
You're righteous, you're righteous, you're RIGHTEOUS
You're always so right oh
And there you are nailing good to a tree
And then say forgive me, forgive me oh
Go ahead and dream
Go ahead believe that you are the chosen one
Rain oh...
This is the last stop...
Here there is more than growing up
And I hope that we can break it back
It's not so black and white
So right...
