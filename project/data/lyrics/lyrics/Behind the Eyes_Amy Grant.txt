[Verse 1]
Well I'd like to figure out where we stand before darkness falls
And I'd like to figure out before too late before hope is lost
Cause the sun that's shining on my face is shining down on you
And the fruit that gives me strength to live is giving you strength too
Can we find a way to find a compromise, though we don't see eye to eye
Eye to eye

[Verse 2]
Well I'd like to figure out a way to leave a troubled past behind
To forget those angry words and wars we fought across the battle lines
Cause tomorrow we could find the road to peace for you and me
And our children in their innocence will follow what they see
Oh we've got to find a way to live our lives, though we don't see eye to eye

[Chorus]
Oh how easy it would be to close the door and walk away
I can't walk out when I believe
You're my brother and we owe it to each other
We've got to try though we don't see eye to eye
Eye to eye

[Interlude]

[Chorus]
Oh how easy it would be to close the door and walk away
I can't walk out when I believe
You're my brother and we owe it to each other
We've got to try though we don't see eye to eye
Eye to eye

[Hook]
Eye to eye
Well I'd like to find a way
Though we don't see eye to eye
Eye to eye
Though we don't see eye to eye

[Outro]
Well I'd like to figure out where we stand before darkness falls

 

[Verse 1]
Wake up, baby, look around
Birds sing, ooh that sound
Reminds me of a line
From unchained melody
Feel like I'm a little girl
Best thing in the whole wide world
Is I can see the makings of a memory

[Pre-Chorus]
I remember how it used to be
Well I'm still dreaming

[Chorus]
'Cause I dream of simple things
I can believe in
Like the feeling this day brings
True love and the miracle of forgiving
I believe in simple things

[Verse 2]
Ain't nothing like a sunny day
Chit-chat at a street cafe
Just paint the picture, baby
Where you wanna be
Take a walk, take a ride
So far, you and I
Don't need a plan
But we can share
This reverie

[Pre-Chorus]
I remember how I used to want it all
Funny now the big things seem so small

[Chorus]
I dream of simple things
I can believe in
Like the feeling this day brings
True love and the miracle of forgiving
I believe in simple things

[Bridge]
Through all the days
The blues, the greys
A ray of light keeps shining

[Interlude]

I believe in simple things

[Bridge]
Through all the days
The blues, the greys
A ray of light was shining

[Chorus]
I dream of simple things
I can believe in
Like the feeling this day brings
True love and the miracle of forgiving
I believe in simple things

I dream of simple things
I can believe in
I believe in simple things

[Outro]
I dream of simple things
I can believe in
Like the feeling this day brings
True love and the miracle of forgiving
I believe in simple things
