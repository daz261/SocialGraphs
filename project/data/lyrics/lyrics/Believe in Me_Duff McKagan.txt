It's been four months since
You gone away
My bed is empty and my heart
Still feels the pain yeah the pain

I see your picture in a magazine
I look away still see you starin' at me
At me

Chorus
I walk the streets at night
And there's no one else in my sight
But you
In my mind

Cause I still love you
Yeah I still love you
I

Buy a ticket to a subway train
A one-way token just to end my pain
From you yeah from you
Ticket says destination unknown
The car stops and I'm back at home
All alone
Without you without you

Chorus
I walk the streets at night
And there's no one else in my
Sight but you
In my mind

Cause I still love you
Yeah I still love you
I

I saw you at a restaurant down on
42nd Street
Drinkin' red wine and laughin'
I kept walkin' by myself with a bottle
Of rye
I don't need you baby

And you're foolin' yourself when
You say
You don't need me
I said you're foolin' yourself
When you say you don't need me

And I'm lyin' fallin' down in the alley
Yeah I'm lyin' to myself as I'm
Screamin'

Chorus

I saw some chick the other day
She had a smile that looked so cool
It looked like you so I walked away

My eyes are tired but I still look cool
My tears are past
And I don't need you, don't need
You, need you

"If you thought I needed you why
Would I be lookin' at chicks and
Lookin' at French fashion magazines"
