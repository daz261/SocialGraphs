[Verse 1]
A king is crying from his throne
He had a queen, but now she's gone
What is this magic that we seek?
The mighty strong to mighty weak

[Pre-Chorus]
Every good girl hears it
Every bad boy fears it
No matter what I see
I believe, I believe

[Chorus]
The power touches me
The power sets us free
The power holds my hand
The power drives me crazy

[Verse 2]
A flower grows, an old man dies
And through it all, we still survive
A poor man dreams, but no one hears
Ain't nothing changed much through the years

[Pre-Chorus]
Every bad day needs it
Every good day breeds it
No matter how it feels
When it's real, you know it's real
It's stronger than anybody
Any man has ever made

[Chorus]
The power touches me
The power helps us see
The power holds my hand, yeah
The power drives me crazy

[Bridge]
It won't take long to understand just how lucky I am
(Hey, hey)
Open up your eyes and see
It won't take long to understand just how lucky I am

[Pre-Chorus]
Every good boy needs it
Every bad girl breeds it
No matter how I feel
Oh, when it's real, you know it's real
It's stronger than anybody
Any man has ever made

[Chorus]
The power...
(Hey, hey)
The power...
The power holds my hand
...Drives me crazy
The power sets us free, yeah
The power holds my hand
The power drives me crazy

[Outro]
Power, power, power...
And I believe and you believe
And we believe that everybody's gonna be alright
Alright in just my mind
Power, power, power, power, power...
