I'm alive and you're alive
And don't we both
Deserve to be happy
We realize we're not the same
So no one here should take
Away the blame
It's okay to walk away
And live to love another day
This is not a fairytale
This is life
And sometimes life fails

CHORUS
Thought I'd let you know
Just before you go
It's alright
Make your brand new start
But keep me in your heart
And you'll be fine
That's reality

As water flows beneath the bridge
We're learning how to forgive
As milk spreads out across the floor
We both agree it's not worth
Fighting for

BRIDGE
Nothing's perfect except God
And a California sunset
We're not perfect
It doesn't mean we're bad
There's a place in the sun
For everyone
You just got to find it
I wish you luck with yours
I have to go and find mine
