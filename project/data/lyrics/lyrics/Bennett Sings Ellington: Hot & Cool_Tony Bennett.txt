You ain't been blue
No, no, no
You ain't been blue
Till you've had that mood indigo
That feelin goes stealin down to my shoes
While I sit and sigh "Go 'long, blues"
Always get that mood indigo
Since my baby said goodbye
In the evenin when lights are low
I'm so lonesome I could cry, boo... boo-boo-boo-boo!
'Cause there's nobody who cares about me
I'm just a soul who's bluer than blue can be
When I get that mood indigo
I could lay me down and die
