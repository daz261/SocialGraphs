For all I've been blessed with in this life
There was an emptiness in me
I was imprisoned by the power of gold
With one kind touch you sent me free

Let the world stop turning
Let the sun stop burning
Let them tell me love's not worth going through
If it all falls apart
I will know deep in my heart
The only dream that mattered had come true:
In this life I was loved by you

For every mountain I have climbed
Every raging river crossed
You were the treasure that I longed to find
Without your love I would be lost

Let the world stop turning
Let the sun stop burning
Let them tell me love's not worth going through
If it all falls apart
I will know deep in my heart
The only dream that mattered had come true:
In this life I was loved by you

I know that I won't live forever
But forever I'll be loving you

Let the world stop turning
Let the sun stop burning
Let them tell me love's not worth going through
If it all falls apart
I will know deep in my heart
The only dream that mattered had come true:
In this life I was loved by you
In this life I was loved by you

 

[Verse 1]
I took a dive into your eyes
And I was in a sea of deep blue green emotion
Now in my dreams it often seems that you are moving me
Like tides moving the ocean

[Pre-Chorus]
My heart hears you calling
And I feel that I'm falling

[Chorus]
Into a love that's deeper than blue
A bottomless love
Into the dreamy deep with you
Bottomless love

[Verse 2]
And as we lie I feel that I am floating
In a stream of clear crystalline feeling
I want to wade into your waves
And let them wash me clean
To hold you is so healing

[Pre-Chorus]
My heart hears you calling
And I feel that I'm falling

[Chorus]
Into a love that's deeper than blue
A bottomless love
Into the dreamy deep with you
Bottomless love

[Bridge]
My sorrows washed away like rain
The lonely simple joys remain
Holy bliss, bottomless love

[Chorus]
Into a love that's deeper than blue
A bottomless love (Dream)
Into the dreamy deep with you
Bottomless love
Into a love that's deeper than blue
A bottomless love (Dream)
Into the dreamy deep with you
Bottomless love (Dream, whoa-oh-oh)

[Outro: Fade]
Bottomless love (Falling)
Bottomless love (Picture of a dreamy deep with you)
Bottomless love (Falling)
Bottomless love (Yes, I've fallen, I've fallen, I've fallen in love with you)
Bottomless love (Falling)
Bottomless love (Woah-oh-oh)
Bottomless love (Falling)
Bottomless love (Ah)
Bottomless love (Falling)
