The cover of darkness no longer conceals
An approaching enemy
There are many ways to kick some ass
With updated technology
You will always get on your knees
In the war you're gonna fight
Prevent agreements between nations
No democracy but more genocide

Keep your eyes open your under control
There is something that's over the top
Penetration and power sends bullets of lead
Inside your body to do the job

Shellfire defense
Pray to god that he will take you in his hands
Shellfire defense
You wish to get the final shot
That makes your nightmare end

Eliminate the threat and minimise the risk
Supremacy against the attacks
New weapons in front of fighting troops
They get no chance for shooting back
Who gave you the criminal passions?
Inclinations to kill
Retribution demand victims
No matter what you feel

Keep your eyes open your under control
There is something that's over the top
Penetration and power sends bullets of lead
Inside your body to do the job

Shellfire defense
Pray to god that he will take you in his hands
Shellfire defense
You wish to get the final shot
That makes your nightmare end

Shellfire defense
Pray to god that he will take you in his hands
Shellfire defense
You wish to get the final shot
That makes your nightmare end

Long vanished is the age of blows with a club
Wholesale murder guarantee
Soldiers within the meaning of law
Decimate the dregs of society
Where's man's dignity and human nature?
Disarmament and combination
Fit in with the needs of present
Peace not revelation

Keep your eyes open your under control
There is something that's over the top
Penetration and power sends bullets of lead
Inside your body to do the job

Shellfire defense
Pray to god that he will take you in his hands
Shellfire defense
You wish to get the final shot
That makes your nightmare end

 

Slazing scents taint with blood
Signed his path of death
Trace him to the place of fright
Searching for his daily bread
When midnight comes around
Be warned because he is out of sight

What carnal secrets does he hide
His ruthless rage will come
Buried deep inside his mind
The rites of the saw began

The saw is the law
The saw is the law

Executed children
Laughing mothers by their side
Feel the pain of ripping flesh
Those who've died
Have paid the price
And drawn their final breath

What carnal secrets does he hide
His ruthless rage will come
Buried deep inside his mind
The rites of the saw began

The saw is the law
The saw is the law

The saw is the law
The saw is the law

What carnal secrets did he hide
His worries of the flesh have come
With tears in his eyes and a gun in his hand
So ends the story of the chainsawman

The saw is the law
The saw is the law

The saw is the law
The saw is the law
The saw is the law
The saw is the law

The saw is the law
The law is the saw
The saw is the law
The law is the saw

 

They took the oath of allegiance
Responsible and proud
Sold their soul for native love
In war to stand their ground

Don't bury the hatchet
Get on with your fight
Snipe down the enemies
Put them out of action
Don't look back
The promised words we never forget

Capture the flag
Capture the flag

Departure to conquest the Hamburger Hill
At the risk of our life
Embitters resistance, deadly traps
Rapid fire - Got no chance to dive

Don't bury the hatchet
Get on with your fight
Snipe down the enemies
Put them out of action
Don't look back
The promised words we never forget

Capture the flag
Capture the flag

Hollow bangs and cries of pain
That filled the air with blood
Fleeing in the minefield reign
Encircled by the flank attacks
A game like Russian roulette
Who will survive?
The mine barrier in front of us
Overpowered in running fight

Armour-piercing bullets
Slaughtered one by one
Two find a way to hide
The tables are turned
By hopeless defeats
Got the power, got the might

Don't bury the hatchet
Get on with your fight
Snipe down the enemies
Put them out of action
Don't look back
The promised words we never forget

Capture the flag
Capture the flag

Now twenty years later
Sitting by the beer
Remembrance comes awake
Talk about friends
That never came back
Fallen by the war's disgrace

Don't bury the hatchet
Get on with your fight
Snipe down the enemies
Put them out of action
Don't look back
The promised words we never forget

Capture the flag
Capture the flag
Capture the flag
Capture the flag
