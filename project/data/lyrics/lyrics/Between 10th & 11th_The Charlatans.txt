Physically I resemble a vulture
Too close to meaning
When the world is telling me
So don't go

And I can't even sell myself
The moods of a foreigner
And the beatings of a train conductor

Physically I resemble a dog
No bones for this one
When the butcher is out for me
So don't go

And I can't even save myself
And your brutality is obvious to me
So please

Inside of me
I am going to break up every part of her
Not here inside me
I want to break up every (break up every part of her)
Not here (not here)

Physically, you resemble a swan
Your femininity or girlish appeal
I don't know

And she can't even save herself
You were going nowhere
Cos you're way down here with me
So lease

Inside of me
I am going to break up every part of her
Not here inside me
I want to break up every (break up every part of her)
Not here (not here)

When the one has been overthrown
The way you look at me from an open fire
I could have died
Although I am alright now you're twisted
Determined and begging for peace

Inside of me
I am going to break up every part of her
Not here inside me
I want to break up every (break up every part of her)
Not here (not here)
