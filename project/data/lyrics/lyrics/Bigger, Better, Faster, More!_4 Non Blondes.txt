[Verse 1]
Here I am and I'm waitin' on a chance to make it right
Every word you say makes my heart go bang bang
'Cause it sounds so nice
Well I've been alone, and you've been a fool
Oh baby, don't you know that's the golden rule?
Well I've been alone and you've been a fool
Oh baby, don't you know that's the way I like it?

[Chorus]
Let me take you away on the wings of my Superfly
Maybe we'll celebrate all the room in the sky
Heaven knows that we'll go boom boom boom

[Verse 2]
What can I do to get you in the mood? Baby I give up
I'm so misused and you're so confused, it's such a drag
Well I've been alone and you've been a fool
But baby don't you know that's the golden rule?
Well I've been alone and you've been a fool
But baby don't you know that's the way I like it?

[Chorus]
Let me take you away on the wings of my Superfly
Maybe we'll celebrate all the room in the sky
Heaven knows that we'll go boom boom boom

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Here I am and I'm waitin' on a chance to make it right
Do I turn you on, or maybe do I turn you off?
Could you just decide?
Well I've been alone and you've been a fool
But baby don't you know that's the golden rule?
Well I've been alone and you've been a fool
But baby don't you know that's the way I like it?

[Chorus]
Let me take you away on the wings of my Superfly
Maybe we'll celebrate all the room in the sky
Let me take you away on the wings of my Superfly
Maybe we'll celebrate all the room in the sky

Superfly, superfly
