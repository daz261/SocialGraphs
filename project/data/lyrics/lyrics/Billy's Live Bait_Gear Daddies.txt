Open your eyes and look around
Then slowly get up off the ground
First figure where you are
Find your keys, your coat, your car
I don’t want to wear your crown
I’ll only let you down
Now both my feet on solid ground
I take a clearer look around
Things weren’t always good
I’d make amends if I thought I could
I was young, very young
I let my life slip so far down
Sometimes I think
I’ve already sealed my fate
Need a sign to hit me like a semi
Tell me that it’s not too late
I don’t want to wear your crown
I’ll only let you down
Maybe it wasn’t meant to be
I’ve got a past keeps haunting me
No matter how hard I try
It’s there, it stares me in the eye
I don’t want to wear your crown
I’ll only let you down
Please don’t make me wear your crown
Don’t you know I was born to let you down?
I don’t want to wear your crown
I’ll only let you down
