I am so seasick of being out to sea
It's got to be the worst thing
That's ever happened to me
But I've got my free pass
My skeleton key
I can open every door that
Stands in front of me

You are so crazy
Should be under lock and key
You've got to be the worst thing
That's every happened to me
But I don't get angry
Got my skeleton key
I can open every door that
Stands in front of me

O.K
I'm seasick
I'm floating all around the sea
Monkey bars
Gone too far
Got my skeleton key
Got my skeleton key

You are so crazy
Should be under lock and key
You've got to be the worst thing
That's ever happened to me
I don't get angry
Got my skeleton key
I can open every door that
Stands in front of me

O.K
I'm seasick
I'm floating all around the sea
Monkey bars
Gone too far
Got my skeleton key
Got my skeleton key
