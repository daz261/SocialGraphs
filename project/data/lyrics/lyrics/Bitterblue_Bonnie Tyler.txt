I had somebody, somebody who loved me
Someone so good to me
You were my angel, you were my heaven
But I was too blind to see
I let you slip away, I guess I never knew
I had the world with you
I'd be there, still be there in your arms

If not for my careless heart
You'd still be loving me
If not for my careless heart
You'd still be mine
I wouldn't have this hurt inside
L wouldn't have these tears to cry
If not for my careless heart
If not for my careless heart

I had my chances
I took advantage
I took it all too far
So now you're gone and I'm all alone
Alone with my lonely heart
I let it fall apart, I didn't care enough
I lost your precious love
You'd be here, still be here in my arms

If not for my careless heart
You'd still be loving me
If not for my careless heart
You'd still be mine
I wouldn't have this hurt inside
L wouldn't have these tears to cry
If not for my careless heart
If not for my careless heart

I'd be loving you, I'd be holding you
I'd be loving you, if not for my
Careless heart

I wouldn't have this hurt inside
I wouldn't have these tears to cry

If not for my careless heart
You'd still be loving me
If not for my careless heart
You'd still be mine
I wouldn't have this hurt inside
L wouldn't have these tears to cry
If not for my careless heart
If not for my careless heart
