Weak and sick I crawl
In the dust of past mistakes
Leaving for the darkness
Of tears and cold heartaches
Suffer in this grief
Of forever burning hate
The ashes of my life
By the torment you create

[Chorus:]
On my knees... remembering
The wasted years of dark insanity

The rage increases fast
As the memories eat me alive
God, I wish this to end
But I'm not prepared to die
No more a human being
Just a fool of anxiety
Unable to escape
The darkest insanity

[Lead - Christopher]
