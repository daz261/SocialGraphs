A penny for your thoughts now baby
Looks like the weight of the world's
On your shoulders now

I know you think you're going crazy
Just when it seems everything's
Gonna work itself out
They drive you right back down

And you said it ain't fair
That a man walks
When a bird can fly
We have to kick the ground
The stars kiss the sky
They say that spirits live
A man has to die
They promised us truth
Now they're giving us lies

Gonna take a miracle to save us this time
And your savior has just left town
Gonna need a miracle
'Cause it's all on the line
And I won't let you down
(No I won't let you down)
The river of your hope is flooding
And I know the dam is busted
If you need me I'll come running
I won't let you down... no, no

You're looking for salvation
You thought that it'd be shining
Like an angel's light
Well, the angels left this nation
And salvation caught the last train
Out tonight
He lost one hell of a fight

He said
I'm just one man, that's all I'll ever be
I never can be everything you wanted from me
I've got plans so big
That any blind man could see
I'm standing in the river
Now I'm drowning in the sea

Gonna take a miracle to save us this time
And your savior has just left town
Gonna need a miracle
'Cause your heart's on the line
And your heartbeat is slowing down
Your feet are grounded still
You're reaching for the sky
You can let 'em clip your wings
'Cause I believe that you can fly

Well my eyes have seen the horror
Of the coming of the flood
I've driven deep the thorny crown
Into the soul of someone's son
Still I'll look you in the eye
'Cause I've believed in things I've thought
And I'll die without regret
For the wars I have fought

Gonna take a miracle to save you this time
And your savior has just left town
Gonna need a miracle
'Cause your heart's doing time
And your conscience is calling you out
It ain't all for nothing
Life ain't written in the sand
I know the tide is coming
But it's time we made a stand
With a miracle

"William H. Bonney, you are not a god"
Cocks his gun and points it at Billy

"Why don't you pull the trigger and find out?"

 

Hey Patty Garrett that's what I used to call you
They tell me you want me but I hear they've got you
They made you a lawman with a badge made of silver
They paid you some money to sell them my soul

But you say this ain't about me, this ain't about you
Or the good and the bad times we've both been through
When the lines between brothers and justice have changed
You do what you've got to cause you can't walk away

Never been rich
Never been poor
I have always been the same
Blessing or a curse
Depends on where your treasure is
Money comes
Money goes
Love eternal

I wonder what would have happened
If you were the killer
And I was the hero
Would things be the same
Or would I have traded
Your life for my own life
Would I have paid
Your debts in your place

But this ain't about me, this ain't about you
Or the good and the bad times we've both been through
When the lines between brothers and justice have changed
You do what you've got to cause you can't walk away

Blood money
That's what I call it
'Cause money for blood ain't no fair exchange
Blood money
Bought and then sold you
But your conscience is all you can take to your grave

 

They say that no man is an island
And good things come to those who wait
But the things i hear are just there to remind me
Every dog will have his day

The spirits they intoxicate me
I watched them infiltrate my soul
They try to say, it's too late for me
Tell my guns I'm coming home

I swear, I'm gonna live forever
Tell my maker he can wait
I'm riding somewhere south of heaven
I'm heading back to Santa Fe
It's judgement day in Santa Fe

Once I was promised absolution
There's only one solution for my sins
You gotta face your ghost, and know with no illusion
That only one of you is going home again

And I blame this world, for making a good man evil
It's this world, that can drive a good man mad
And it's this world that turns a killer into a hero
Well I blame this world for making a good man bad

Now I ain't getting into heaven
If the devil has his way
I swear I'm gonna live forever
Heading back to Santa Fe
Got debts to pay in Santa Fe
It's Judgement day in Santa Fe
Oh lord have mercy

"Guitar solo"

So I save the prayer when I need it most
To the father, the son and the holy ghost
And I'll sign it from a sinner with no name
When I meet my maker, will he close the book
On the hearts I broke and the lives I took
Will he walk away, cause my soul's to late to save

Now I ain't getting into heaven
If the devil has his way
I swear I'm gonna live forever
Heading back to Santa Fe
Got debts to pay in Santa Fe
It's judgment day in Santa Fe
