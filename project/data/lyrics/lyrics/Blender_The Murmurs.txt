Big daddy said it's o.k. holding out for love
Don't like it much but that's the way it goes
Big talker, thrill stalker, sitting on the time
Deciding every day who is next in line
Sick bitch where's your head looking for a lover
Sick of all the chills time for another

I believed you, and I believed you, I believed you

Bend down lower put your head on my lap
Don't you know that's where it's at?
Everybody's coming, everyone but me
'Cause they don't give me nothin', see?
Trip fit, go ahead, kiss me again
I always like it when it ends

I believed you, and I believed you, I believed you

Play it cool now, and then hit me hard
And don't ever be late
Hesitation rising, 'cause that's what you do
Well I'm full of it, too

Cause I believed you, and I believed you, I believed you
