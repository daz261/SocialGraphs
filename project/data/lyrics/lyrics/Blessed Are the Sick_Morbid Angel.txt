[Verse 1]
Hot wind burns me
Burning as I fall
Cast away
Speechless in the holy way
I survive
The scourge and banishing
To scorching land
I am lord, I take command

[Chorus]
Fall from grace

[Verse 2]
Forgive me not
This knowledge makes me strong
To resurrect
The cities of the damned
All the treasures of Sodom
Now belong to me - celebrate
Fallen angels take my hand

[Chorus]
Fall from grace

[Bridge]
Whores long for my flesh
And my desire
Lust anointing me now
Consume my soul

[Outro]
I writhe in the flesh and the sins of hell
I am Belial
I bend my knees not before my selfish desire
