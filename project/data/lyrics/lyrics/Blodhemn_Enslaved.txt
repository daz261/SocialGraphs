Activate the aggression that exposes the
Hidden
Denying the existance pf praying to
Illusions
Seek gnosis in the forbidden
Drink from the wates of knowledge
And see what lies you breathe

Absorb the vital spark of deities false
And ressurect the true gods
To whom strength and wisdom is the key
And not the lectures of folly
Annoint your sould with pleasure
Apposed to mummifications through impotence

The truth is unconscious, asleep
Waiting to be summoned, to be worshipped
A neglected phallos, banished from thought
A weapon overseen by the creator
But cherished by those of the path
Unlock the beast
Transform
