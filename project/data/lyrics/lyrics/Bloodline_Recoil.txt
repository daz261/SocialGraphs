Get your nightcap mama, and your gown
Little before day we gonna shake 'em on down
Must I holler, Ah, must I shake 'em on down

I done stop hollerin', I done stop hollerin'
Must I shake 'em on down

Baby got somethin' I don't know what it is
Made me drunker than a whiskey still

Done stop hollerin', Ah, must I shake 'em on down
I done stop hollerin', ooh, must I holler
Ah, must I shake 'em on down

Late last night baby I come knocked on your door
I heard him when he told you to tell me
You didn't want me no more

Done stop hollerin', Ah, must I shake 'em on down
I done stop hollerin' I done stop hollerin'
Must I shake 'em on down
