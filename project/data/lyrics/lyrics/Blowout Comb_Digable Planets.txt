[Cop]
Alright, boy

[Butterfly]
Ah, man

[Cop]
Give you your rights

[Butterfly]
Here we go again

[Cop]
You have the right to remain silent

[Ladybug]
Hey Ish, what's goin on?

[Butterfly]
Chill, chill it's cool

[Cop]
Give up the right to remain silent, anything you say can and will be used against you

[Butterfly]
Whatever man, whatever

[Cop]
Do you understand each of these rights I've explained to you?

[Butterfly]
Oh, like I ever had rights, kid?

[Cop]
Do you wish to give up the right to remain silent?

[Butterfly]
Hell yeah

[Verse 1: Ladybug Mecca]
So now lets let into, in my pocket pack
Pummel and I epic, black ethic lack
I walk again, you were shade gray, come display
Mazes in black, fire in the west
Shit is shakin', it's fly
I'm in lookies when I'm pushing vinyl time
Up the Fort, where I'm caught
And my thought to shakin' up a few loose
Now I let my cause shoot, KRS One
Cause we fade in and out, are you swinging or coming?
I'm solid on this thought, this ain't living
It's heavy every setback, even when I was a shorty
Now we catch you in your four, thrice
Check me in another place, space, and joy
Nothing you could serve could ever
Ace me boy
Fat laces, I'm out, fat and no babies

"That's right baby"

[Chorus]
That's right, sho you right
That's right, sho you right
That's right, sho you right
That's right, sho you right
That's right, sho you right
That's right, sho you right
That's right, sho you right
That's right, sho you right

[Verse 2: Doodlebug]
I got Harlem on my mind, Devil on my back
Brooklyn in my blood and Butter's on the track
I got insect thoughts, catch the cool ways
Clouds of purple haze keep me in a daze
The jazz, the jive, the poetry
The style, the lingo, the bags of equality
Many different things try to get to me
But in a world of hard rock, I keep my humility
The funkanaut from the kingdom of not
With galactic sure shot, they can't won't don't stop
Flock to the rhythm I bring
Sing songs call survival on the Mingus revival
Scored the bass hit, with my bugged out clique
It's Doodlebug, give me love for a visual script
Sip the groove juice, it's kind of rough
Sevens never bluff, I had enough, eleven

[Chorus]
That's right, sho you right
That's right, sho you right
That's right, sho you right
That's right, sho you right
That's right, sho you right
That's right, sho you right
That's right, sho you right
That's right, sho you right

[Verse 3: Butterfly]
In the east I rose
Froze in the pose
Of a land diseased
Flows that cooler summer breeze
Nikki did Kevin's braids, we got four in the 'Lac
As we swoop at warp seven, holler don't crowd cats
Cause look, corpie is the color and Butter he do it low
All you hear is poppers and rubber I'm saying oh
Man, we keep it popping on hot days
Shit, I got the fish eggs dropping any block you dip
And I dazzle that mood with the cool out, fool
Easing semi-swerve to the curb like the do
I'm fro, blow, got that right
Groove with soul and I'm still spinnin'
Cross 110 and indicate them something else
Blackest space, deepest sea
(Scoff) My shit's, a natural high, the man can't put no thing on me
Now catch me when my mind stretch out, it's astro black
Time reaching into end, nappy afro blue
We Sw-ing, fightin' out the corners
Do my tha-a-ang like Huey with it, nigga

[Chorus]
That's right, sho you right
That's right, sho you right
That's right, sho you right
That's right, sho you right
That's right, sho you right
That's right, sho you right
That's right, sho you right
That's right, sho you right

 

[Butterfly]
DPS forever hit ya' with the live stuff
Suliman the Bronx Ripper on the live puff
V Love, that's my money like dominoes
Brooklyn do keep it rocking till the sun shows
I pop my junk my junk, I pop my junk my junk
I pop my junk my junk, Pop my junk my junk
I pop my junk my junk, like what you want you want
Pop my junk my junk, I pop my junk
The noise that we made is blue, in color sound
Toys who played my crew couldn't walk the new ground
Or chalk the new sound
A bop like Teddy Charles was burning
When I excurse on excursions
Arriving at the doors of mind shores of seas
Burnt you with degrees solarly
Plus my leather jacket go acid disappear in the wisp
In the mist, with a fist
Proletariat, Cad-i-lac steering it
Fro soul gold Panther crew grab our poppers
Now, I'm making bacon
Still saying wa ah salaam ah lakum
Fresh joints we make 'em like water
Butter rap treasures at my leisure whatever whatever
So I gave my mind a pound cause y'all we had it down
We symbolize the blessed and represent the rest
Grabs in my pockets I release my hot rockets
K.B. said "What you give 'em?" I was like "Mad rhythm."
That's my junk

[Ladybug Mecca]
Eric Dolphy always hits me with the live stuff
Bahamadia back the sounds with the love love
T.J. and Lisa real peoples 89 and still
In Fort Green on diamond back is where I'm at
Feelin' da funk da funk that's in the trunk the trunk
I feel the funk da funk, feelin' the funk da funk
I'm feelin' funk da funk I'm in the trunk da trunk
Feelin' da funk da funk, I am the funk
I raise everyday for the mass
Tote my fist right up right against the fascist
Descend to my borough fix my diction
It's way on time
Fossil watch fifth line still shining
I'm left this year I'm not a player
In my vein lives bell hooks Derrick Bell, Reggie Butler
See Marvin knew it, and Sly knew it
Cube know it and now we do it outta Brooklyn
Outta sight brown sandals handlin' M.C.s with angles
Commit to street corners where players be jayin
I'm saying a Digable swinger
Word to mouth brought the clout 'specially in the summer
We vanish like vapor
Burn paper
We deal real-real so chill
We linger in the funk

[Butterfly]
Yes Yes, bus stop what's (Watts) up
On the script side
Low down the whole mix and flips I 63
Jay B and M.C. baby blue great
Do it fluent keep it real and straight

[Ladybug]
We make it bump de bump, we make it bump se bump
We make it pump se pump, we make it bump

[Butterfly]
Save your corny missions for the tracks you lying on
We got ammunition for the streets we dying on

[Ladybug]
Stones, rocks, subways, blocks, chill mode

[Butterfly]
Loot fold
Rebel wit no pause down to die for cause be-cause
Denia gotta see a fatter day

[Ladybug]
It's Saturday I'm looking at the streets as my Nikes
Cover asphalt
Day gives way to night

[Butterfly]
My weight crush trash broken glass
Play the wall with one foot up
"Yo What up Ish?", "What's up."

[Ladybug]
The flyer we get the higher we get
Good try-ers

[Butterfly]
Is good die-ers that it so I move
We showed and we prove

[Ladybug]
It's groove food

[Butterfly]
What's going on
You want to see knowledge born, see C Knowledge Born
Before we fall victim we lick 'em
I ain't playin'

[Ladybug]
Meet me at the corner of Myrtle and Adelphi
I bless you with some joints, the mental hollow points
We do it in the park, we do it in the park

[Butterfly under Ladybug]
That's right, that's right
We do it in the park, we do it in the park

[Butterfly]
I'm fluent after dark, in any sit-e-ation (situation)

[Ladybug]
My tools, jewels, the nation

[Butterfly]
That's how we bump
