[Verse 1]
I don't take my whiskey to extremes
Don't believe in chasing crazy dreams
My feet are planted firmly on the ground
But darling when you come around

[Chorus]
I get carried away by the look by the light in your eyes
Before I even realize the ride I'm on baby I'm long gone
I get carried away nothing matters but being with you
Like a feather flying high up in the sky on a windy day, I get carried away

[Verse 2]
It might seem like an ordinary night
Same ol' stars, the same ol' moon up high
But when I see you standing at your door
Nothing's ordinary anymore

[Chorus]
I get carried away by the look by the light in your eyes
Before I even realize the ride I'm on baby I'm long gone
I get carried away nothing matters but being with you
Like a feather flying high up in the sky on a windy day, I get carried away

[Chorus]
I get carried away by the look by the light in your eyes
Before I even realize the ride I'm on baby I'm long gone
I get carried away nothing matters but being with you
Like a feather flying high up in the sky on a windy day, I get carried away

Carried away
