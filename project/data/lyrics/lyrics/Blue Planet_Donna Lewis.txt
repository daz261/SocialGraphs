[Verse 1]
I could be your sea of sand
I could be your warmth of desire
I could be your prayer of hope
I could be your gift of everyday
I could be your tide of heaven
I could be a hint of what's to come
I could be ordinary, I could be the one
I could be your blue eyed angel
I could be the storm before the calm
I could be your secret pleasure
I could be your well wishing well
I could be your breath of life
I could be your European dream
I could be ordinary
I could be the one

[Chorus]
And I would lie here in the darkness
And I would lie here for all time
And I would lie here watching over you
Comfort you, sing to you

[Verse 2]
I could be your worry partner
I could be your socialite
I could be your green-eyed monster
I could be your force of light
I could be your temple garden
I could be your tender hearted child
I could be ordinary, I could be the one

[Chorus]
And I would lie here in the darkness
And I would lie here for all time
And I would lie here watching over you
Comfort you, sing to you

[Bridge]
Will I ever change the journey?
Will the hushed tones disappear?
Oh, little Rita let me hold you (Let me hold you)
Oh, little Rita let me love you

[Verse 3]
I could be your leafy island
I could be your thunder in the clouds
I could be your dark enclosure
I could be your romantic soul
I could be your small beginning
I could be your soothing universe
I could be ordinary, I could be the one

[Outro]
I could be ordinary, I could be the one
I could be ordinary, I could be the one
