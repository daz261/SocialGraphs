I got a long grey mare
She won't let me ride
I got a long grey mare
She won't let me ride
She makes me brush her in the morning
Put her to bed every night, yeah

Long grey mare
Why can't we be just like before?
Long grey mare
Why can't we be just like before?
We used to ride so hard
Oh, till we couldn't take no more, yeah

Long grey mare
Don't I feed you every day?
Long grey mare
Well, don't I feed you every day?
And when I dig you with my spur
You turn around the other way

 

When I first met you baby
I didn't even know your name
When I first met you baby
I didn't even know your name
Oh, I was feelin' low on the ground
Bad luck and evil women were to blame

I never realized
How sweet and kind one woman can be
I never realized, people
How sweet and kind a woman can be
Oh, but when I looked in your eyes
I knew true love had come to me
Yeah

Take my hand
Hold it tight and don't let go
Take my hand, take my hand
Hold it tight and don't let go
'Cause our love is like a merry-go-round
Forever and ever round it goes
