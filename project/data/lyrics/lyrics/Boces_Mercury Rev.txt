You think, you think
You think too much, I think, I think you think too much, I think
I think, you don't know what you're talking about, you do, you do
I must be honest, I hate this slower street
I park all ready to be robbed by people that I meet
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I hear
I know, I know, I know, got nothing to fear
You keep pushing, you keep pushing, pushy, pushy, don't push me
I'm an insect, I'm a figment, I'm a chief as a genuine minion
Imaginations, imaginations, imagine my frustrations
You pick a fight with a .45 caliber, won't help you

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah

It was a dismal rain that cooled the hot
When it trickled down we all saw spots float over, float over
Now I've been in jail for a million years
Got all these people holding me back, I know, I know
I must be honest I hate this stone street
I park all ready to be robbed by people
I know, I know and I'm growing tried, I'm growing tired
It's my favorite mangle, a fanciful tangle
That went down like the (?) spastic and spasms and spasms

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah

Suffer the death of what you are, it's now, it's now
Suffer the death of what you were, has no effect on a hard-boiled world
Warm, weary eyed, (?) cat skill world
You must follow blind just shoot a pigeon-holed pigeon
You're waiting to be sheave
Just like you sheave that grazes all over your face
And you've got the urge to be a lightning bolt
And you've got the urge to be a lightning bolt
I've gotta tell you, I just don't know, I've gotta tell you, I just don't know
What the fuck you're trying to say? What the fuck, man?
What the fuck you trying to say?
Just sit there and shut your mouth, just sit there and shut up

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
