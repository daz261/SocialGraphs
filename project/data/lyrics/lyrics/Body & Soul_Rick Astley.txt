Do you believe it what the papers say?
They're driving me insane they push me over my limit
Do you believe it they catch me every time?
It ought to be a crime. Wo, the things they say

There ought to be a reason for turning black to white
Sometimes get the feeling that it's done to spite
They don't need a reason to turn your world around

I'm waiting for the bell to ring
I want the children to sing
And I'm waiting for the bad man to fall
I'm just about done with it all

Do you believe it, when politicians talk
And make, make the people walk into the fire
Do, you concede, is there no reprieve
From their power game, I know there's someone to blame

We ought to be forgiven for taking in their words
They don't even write them now is that absurd
They don't need a reason to tear your world apart

I'm waiting for the bell to ring
I want the children to sing
And I'm waiting for the bad man to fall
I'm just about done with it all

And I'm just about done with it all

With it all

And I'm waiting, you know I'm waiting
For the angels to sing for the freedom it brings
For the bad man to fall
When the children call, I want the angels to sing
And I'm just about done with it all

And I'm waiting for the bell to ring
I want the children to sing
And I'm waiting for the bad man to fall
I'm done with it all

I'm waiting for the bell to ring
I want the children to sing
And I'm waiting for the bad man to fall
I'm just about done with it all

 

I walk the wire every night
I can't decide between wrong and right
I've lost control over the things i do
'Cause I'm hopelessly falling in love with you

Now the one who never took a chance
Becomes a victim of circumstance
I've lost my way, now I'm so confused
'Cause I'm hopelessly falling in love with you

All my dreams are far behind me
They don't matter anymore
I don't care about the things I could lose
'Cause I'm hopelessly falling in love with you

Now the one who always played it safe
Becomes another who's lost his way
I can't believe it, though I know it's true
'Cause I'm hopelessly falling in love with you

And all my dreams begin to blind me
And I was so confused
And I don't care about the things I could lose
'Cause I'm hopelessly falling in love with you

I'm not gonna fight it, I'm gonna choose
To hopelessly fall, oh yeah
You know I'll hopelessly fall in love, with you
