[Intro]
Lately, lately, I find I rush

[Pre-Chorus]
Can't piece together the sun in the sky or the spots on my face
And I must be stuck, my feet already are
I must be lost, my feet already are
And I must be fast, my feet already are
You'll soon be dust your deeds already are

[Chorus]
You'll soon be dust your deeds already are
You saw no orb no fiery bushes either
I must be drunk I feel unsteady
No monster me, sadly no saint either...

[Verse 1]
Walk back into Stockholm - Stockholm - our travels take us further north
Where there's fish in the sea and food on the shelves

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And I must be cold, my feet already are
You must be old, so take it easier
And I must be cold, my feet already are
You must be old, so take it easier...

[Chorus]
You'll soon be dust your deeds already are
You saw no orb no fiery bushes either
I must be drunk I feel unsteady
No monster me, sadly no saint either...

[Verse 2]
Walk back into, walk back into
Wicked, wicked, wicked...

Belly, belly, and slap
I love to feel the food in my guts and the fat in my veins
I love to feel the food in my guts and

[Chorus]
You'll soon be dust your deeds already are
You saw no orb no fiery bushes either
I must be drunk I feel unsteady
No monster me, sadly no saint either...

You'll soon be dust your deeds already are
You saw no orb no fiery bushes either
I must be drunk I feel unsteady
No monster me, sadly no saint either...

[Outro]
Wicked, wicked, wicked...
