She won't tell me lies
She want to see me smile, yeah

Every time you let it show
I didn't want to know
By the time I had lost my soul
You had to go

She come in disguise
I want to say goodbye, yeah

Every time I let it show
You didn't want to know
By the time I had lost my soul
You had to go
You had to go

Love's strong, mine gone
Still have the time to sing my song
Love's strong, mine gone
Still have the time to sing my song
Still have the time to sing my song
Still have the time to sing my song

She got her own way
Same as yesterday, yeah

Every time you let it show
I didn't want to know
By the time I had sold my soul
You had to go
You had to go

Love's strong, mine gone
Still have the time to sing my song
Still have the time to sing my song

Love's strong, mine gone
Still have the time to sing my song
Still have the time to sing my song
Still not a crime to sing my song
