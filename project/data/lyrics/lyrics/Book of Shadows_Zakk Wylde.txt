For I shall carry this weight
Of the words I wished to say
For just one moment, I'll give back all my yesterdays
For all of the songs no longer sound the same
As I keep reaching back for one more day

[Chorus]
Lay me down upon your darkness
Lay me down upon your fears
Lay me down across the waters that gather all your tears
Lay me down

No more promises to be kept or made
Within my wounded silence
And the mourning that never fades
For all of the roads that we walked
They no longer look the same
As I keep reaching back for one more day

[Chorus]

Falling so far
So far from what I've known
Falling so far
Can I find my way back home?

Lay me down upon your darkness
Lay me down upon your fears
Lay me down across the waters that gather all your tears

[Chorus]
