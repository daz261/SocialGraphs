Lonely tears roll down as midnight comes around
But I can make it through in sweet dreams of you

In the shadows of the night, I still hold you tight
Yes, it all comes true in sweet dreams of you

In sweet dreams, I see the way things used to be
When your love was mine and your heart was true
In sweet dreams of you

Oh, I call out your name and you come to me again
The way you used to do in sweet dreams of you
In sweet dreams of you
In sweet dreams of you
