[Verse 1]
Fallen idol
Hanged man
Great winds
Rides the mill
Further into the vast
Limits do not exist

[Bridge]
Five day pain
Closer now than ever

[Verse 2]
Birds escape
Mute flock of winds
One with weather
Sight is getting dim

 

[Verse 1]
Grey park look the same
And the days are pale
I never thought it would rain this way
I should be knowing that, it used to be me

[Chorus]
Let's stay here for a while
Is something gonna happen today?

[Verse 2]
Your smile has decayed
It will never be the same
I never thought I would laugh again
I should be knowing this, it used to be me

[Chorus]
Let's stay here for a while
Is something gonna happen today?
Let's stay here for a while
Is something gonna happen today?

[Verse 3]
Now it's dark and you're colder
Now it's dark and I'm older
Now it's dark and you're colder
And you tell me my parks are grey

[Chorus]
Let's stay here for a while
Is something gonna happen today?
Let's stay here for a while
Is something gonna happen today?

[Verse 4]
Grey park look the same
All the days are pale
I never thought it would rain this way
I should be knowing that, it used to be me

[Chorus]
Let's stay here for a while
Is something gonna happen today?
Let's stay here for a while
Is something gonna happen today?
