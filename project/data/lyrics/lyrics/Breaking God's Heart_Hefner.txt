You wouldn't believe in my new belle she flits and weaves a curious spell
And under my skin there's a place where she resides
Finding a release in prayers and psalms I will obey her articulate commands
She is just a coquette and how I wish I could forget
Breathing new life in to the sad witch and she promised me three wishes and all I wish is she should remain here
A poisonous saint with a brittle, crippled frame and she fooled me with her motherly gestures, my only guess is she's misguided
The sins, the sins the heavenly limbs that greet below the red, red lights
Hold no sway with me now she's my intended
The jewels around her neck retain a curious sheen, god is in my heart and tearing at the seams
Her atheist tracts are certainly persuading
(and I don't know, and I don't want to know, if she floats or drowns, if she floats or drowns.)

 

[Verse 1]
Sobriety breeds sincerity, and Lydia Pond she is my gravity
I don't know how she felt when she took that E
But in the morning she was shaking, she was twitching, she was jerking
Oh, June the 5th she moved to Paris
She could not stand the state of British politics
And I just can't convince her that I'm socialist
And every night I pray for mail in the morning
[Chorus]
Sweet Lydia Pond is doing it for me
And I want to sing a hymn for the postal service
Sinful and proud since I stopped sleeping around
I'm so faithful now to Lydia's handwriting
That it makes me guess the circumstances under which she wrote it
Why she used the f-word when she never, ever spoke it
She pasted on a passport photo of herself in pigtails
And underneath she'd written "did my touch make you less lonely?"
[Verse 2]
Oh she promised me that we'd be creasing sheets
And that our bodies would be bruising, wrestling underneath
And I wanted to ask her how she cut her teeth
And why she let time slip through her skinny, skinny fingers
[Chorus]
Oh, sweet Lydia Pond is doing it for me
And I want to sing a hymn for the postal service
Sinful and proud since I stopped sleeping around
I'm so faithful now to Lydia's handwriting
Oh, sweet Lydia Pond is doing it for me
And I want to sing a hymn for the postal service
Sinful and proud since I stopped sleeping around
I'm so faithful now to Lydia's handwriting
That it makes me guess the circumstances under which she wrote it
Why she used the f-word when she never, ever spoke it
She pasted on a passport photo of herself in pigtails
And underneath she'd written "did my touch make you less lonely?"
And underneath she'd written "did my touch make you less lonely?"
