[Verse 1]
I work so hard, so don't trip me up
Shaking a leg like the tail of the pup
I'm paying dues until I register heat
Sure hope I don't end up on the street

[Chorus]
Home, boy
Home, boy
Everybody needs a home
Home, boy
Home, boy
Everybody needs a home

[Verse 2]
So many people rise and fall
Who's looking after you at all?
Nobody knows anybody at all
Strangers in paradise down at the mall

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
The life we live is tricky, tricky
I love my home, and my family
Who's going to love you when the
Mountain gets steep?
We're going to make it in a Jeep

 

[Verse]
The cops are well-groomed, with
Muscled physiques in Butt Town
Their tan uniforms are tailored in chic
In Butt Town
Any young black male who walks down the street
Is going to get stopped by a car full of meat
But the girl with the hair
Flies by in her underwear
She's done nothing so far to deserve that car
When you live in Butt Town
You got to get down

[Chorus]
But in Butt Town I'm learning
In Butt Town I'm earning
In Butt Town I'm turning
Into my worst nightmare

[Verse 2]
I'm telling you, it's a motley crew in Butt Town
Monday you're new, and Friday you're through
In Butt Town
The producer is wily, and owns what he sells
The talent is eager to go straight to hell
The tits are amazing, and everyone's gazing
At some body part
That's the nature of art in Butt Town
All over Butt Town dreams have a show down
All over Butt Town values are thrown down

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
In Butt Town baby
I'm going to be a star
I'm going to shake my butt far
Now here we go
I'm going to shake my butt
Shake my butt, shake my butt
In Butt Town

 

[Verse 1]
I was gently raised
Fussed over in school
Fed and housed and entertained
Wanting to be cool
Summers in the grass
Winters warm and slow
Until the one thing on my mind was to just
Get up and go

[Chorus]
We're the undefeated
We got what they want
We're so bored and spoiled
Life is just a bag of pot
We're the undefeated
TV in the shade
Girls at all our parties
We have really got it made

[Verse 2]
There's a real mean world outside
Where many lives are lost
But struggle builds character
And we are growing soft
I don't want to sit and watch no TV show
I want to roam and be challenged
I want to grow and grow

[Chorus]
We're the undefeated
We got what they want
We're so fucking spoiled
Life is just a bag of pot
We're the undefeated
TV in the shade
Girls at all our parties
We have really got it made

[Verse 3]
What have we made?
A giant jail
A bunch of walls
That's all that we've made
Oh, my
We're the undefeated
We got what they want
We're so bored and spoiled
Life is just a bag of pot
We're the undefeated
We got what they want
We're so bored and spoiled
Life is just a bag of pot

[Outro]
We're the undefeated
Always undefeated
We're the undefeated
We're the undefeated
Now

 

[Verse]
Who's going to tell you goodnight?
Who's going to put out the light?
I love you and love is almost crazy
Slipping through the so and so's
Over all the fields we go
Moonlight lady
Don't want to tell you so long
Don't want to mess up your song
Feeling like I do I'm almost crazy
Choosing all the red blue jeans
Watching people be so mean
Moonlight lady
I'm on fire
And I can hardly breathe
Time goes by
And all alone
My poor heart grieves
I love you just because I do
I didn't plan it with you
But now we're here
We might as well accept it
We're together for all time
Marching through the fields of dimes
Moonlight lady

 

[Verse]
Sometimes I don't even move a muscle
Baby while you lie awake all night
I think I've got 9 lives in these corpuscles
Girl, you know sometimes I don't think right
I hear voices in the hall
I wake up and it's nothing at all
A hungry wolf, an angry child
Or something wild
Something wild
Something wild
Something wild
It's not as if we could think that things
Was one way
Or they would all just be that way right now
When I was a kid I thought that some day
I could tame this lion heart some
Way, some how
Now I'm hungry for the love
That doesn't know what it's thinking of
Searching for the meek and mild
Like something wild
Something wild
Something wild
Something wild
There's a hole where the wind blows through
And some curtains too
But I can't hide a thing from you
You know where I'm coming from
Well I tried getting there under my own steam
But my very last chance was shot
Now you're riding me down like a submarine
I can feel you in my veins, running hot
I went out and stole a new pair of shoes
Some pocket money and a place to go
Now we got to get up and scream at the
Top of our lungs like it was going to die
If we didn't make it so
I hear voices in the hall
I wake up and it's nothing at all
A hungry wolf-an angry child
Something wild

 

[Verse]
I'm sliding like a lizard on my belly and back
It's a miracle I haven't fallen through any cracks
The life on display is trouble for sure
The drugs that I took have made me impure
The neon forest is lighting up
The neon forest is lighting up
My brain
I've learned some nasty lessons
So I'm shutting my mouth
A fury in my gut is spinning me round and round
To be a total phony is the winning design
When the fabric of life is a horny goldmine
The neon forest is my home
And like a cartoon cat I roam
Where only kids are still alive
And anyway they're going to fry
My brain
You can get a weird prize for being adored
You can join the "in crowd" for being a whore
Although you are lonely you wish for a fence
America takes drugs in psychic defense
You can say what you want but nobody's there
Have you got any money?
Are you anybody?
