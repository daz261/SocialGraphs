It was a rainy night
When he came into sight
Standing by the road
With no umbrella, no coat

So I pulled up along side
And I offered him a ride
He accepted with a smile
So we drove for a while

I didn't ask him his name
This lonely boy in the rain
Fate, tell me it's right
Is this love at first sight?
Please don't make it wrong
Just stay for a night

All I wanna do is make love to you
Say you will, you want me too
All I wanna do is make love to you
I got loving arms to hold onto

So we found this hotel
It was a place I knew well
We made magic that night
Oh, he did everything right

He brought the woman out of me
So many times, easily
And in the morning, when he woke
All I left him was a note

I told him I am the flower
You are the seed
We walked in the garden
We planted a tree

Don't try to find me
Please don't you dare
Just live in my memory
You'll always be there

All I wanna do is make love to you
One night of love was all we knew
All I wanna do is make love to you
I got loving arms to hold onto

Whoa, oh, we made love
Love like strangers
All night long
We made love

Then it happened one day
We came 'round the same way
You can imagine his surprise
When he saw his own eyes

I said, "Please, please understand
I'm in love with another man
And what he couldn't give me, oh, whoa
Was the one little thing that you can"

All I wanna do is make love to you
One night of love was all we knew
All I wanna do is make love to you
Come on, say you will, you want me too

All I wanna do is make love to you
One night of love was all we knew
All I wanna do is make love to you
Say you will, baby, want me too

All night long, all night long
All night long, all night long

All I wanna do, all I wanna do
All I wanna do, all I wanna do

All I wanna do is make love to you
One night of love was all we knew

 

Deep in the darkness slumber
Endless sleep
Nothing moves inside my funeral suite
I feel the sun slip down as hunger strikes
Waking like being born
Here comes the night

All my senses awakened
By little demons
Taste the human heartbeat
Bittersweet
Bittersweet

Don't take long
To get back in the groove
Sharpen up your attitude
Get down with the moves
Don't look no stranger
In the eye
Walk across some trouble baby
Just walk on by

No tomorrow-take it right now

In the night I walk alone
In the night is where I belong
Take my flesh-I'll give you my soul
Hungry night keeps driving me on

Neon concrete jungle
Devour the weak the humble
Hear the city nocturne
Makes you burn

Oh slip on into darkness
Sharpen up your awareness
Get your seven senses working tonight

No tomorrow-take it right now

In the night I walk alone
In the night-that's where I belong
Take my flesh-I'll give you my soul
Hungry night keeps driving me on

No tomorrow-I take it right now

In the night I walk alone
In the night-that's where I belong
Take my flesh-I'll give you my soul
Hungry night keeps driving me on

In the night I walk alone
In the night-that's where I belong
Take my flesh-I'll give you my soul
Hungry night keeps driving me on
On and on

 

I pray for the love
That's fallen from grace
The tears left behind
Won't wash from my face
I'm left with all these feelings
But nothing fills the space
Of the love that once was
That's fallen from grace

Every little picture
Hanging on the wall
Every little trace of you
I've found them all
I close my eyes
It's all I can do
Everywhere I look
I see some part of you

Been through every reason
And they all seem to fit
No one's pleaded guilty now
There's nothing to admit
There's no one to blame baby
Once you believe
'Cos people only touch and go
But love will never leave

I pray for the love
That's fallen from grace
The tears left behind
Won't wash from my face
I'm left with all these feelings
But nothing fills the space
Of the love that once was
That's fallen from grace

I'm a little disappointed
I'm a little bit relieved
I feel a little sorry baby
I feel a bit deceived
No no not by you darlin'
I know love's demanding
Live and learning every day
But never understanding
Shattered dream and memories of you
Left hanging over me
A cross to bear
When love cools
A crown of thorns
For the queen of fools

I pray for the love
That's fallen from grace
The tears left behind
Won't wash from my face
I'm left with all these feelings
But nothing fills the space
Of the love that once was
That's fallen from grace

 

Every night without you is more than I can bear
Moonlight can be torture
When your love isn't there
I see you in the shadows
I can hear you in the wind
Think of you and I can feel my world closing in
I can't sleep I keep wishing I could touch you
I'd be fine if I could make it through
Through these

Cruel nights
Cruel nights
Missing you nights
What do I do nights
Cruel nights without your love

Counting every minute
Every minute feels like days
Feels like time is standing still since you've been away
Always thought you'd stay forever
Always thought that you'd be here
Now it's been a lifetime since I held you near
Days crawl by, I keep wishing they'd be over
But I know they're only leading me to
To these

Cruel nights
Cruel nights
Missing you nights
What do I do nights

Cruel nights without your love
(Cruel nights) since we've been apart
(Cruel nights) it's been tearing up my heart
(What do I do nights) since you've been
Away baby
Cruel nights

Oh I just can't get through another night
Without you beside me
I need you beside me

I can't sleep
I keep wishing I could touch you
I'd be fine if I could make it through
Through these cruel nights...

Cruel nights
Cruel nights

 

Standing here helpless
Where do I go
If you leave me alone?
Where do I turn now
If it don't work out?

As far as I can see
This isn't the way
That you said it would be

Chorus:
Don't leave me like this
Don't leave me stranded
If you walk away now
You leave me empty-handed
Don't leave me like this
Don't leave me stranded

Don't leave me now
Don't leave me

Wasn't it you
Who brought me here
To the place lovers go?
Just look at these arms
Reaching out to you

Said that you'd always care
I just turn around
And there's nobody there

Chorus (1x)

Don't leave me now

You said that you'd always care
I just turn around
And there's nobody there

Don't leave me like --

Chorus (1x)

Stranded

Chorus (1x)

Stranded

Don't leave me like this
No, don't leave me

 

Call it bad timing
But I call it destiny
It wouldn't have happened
If it wasn't meant to be

I felt your heart like a magnet
Your eyes were touching me
Touching me, touching me

I want your world to turn
Just for me
I want your fire to burn just for me
Like the moon affects the tide and the sea
I want your world to turn just for me

I won't share your love
No I want it all for my own
When you are in her arms
It really cuts me down to the bone

I felt your heart like a magnet
Your eyes were touching me
Touching me, touching me

I want your world to turn
Just for me yeah
I want your fire to burn just for me
Like the moon affects the tide and the sea
I want you world to turn just for me

I want your world to turn
Just for me yeah
I want your fire to burn just for me
Like the moon affects the tide and the sea
I want you world to turn just for me

Just for me
Just for me
