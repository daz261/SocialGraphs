I woke up in the morning
Seven twenty-four
Drank a cup of coffee
Stepped out the door
I said Goodbye
To my old best friend
I took a ride
To the old West End

I walked along Princes Street
My feet were hurting bad
As I squirmed inside my shoes
I was thinking about my dad
There was the bones of a song
Beatin' around my head
Unless I remember it wrong
This is what it said:

Edinburgh Castle hugging the sky
Cold grey stone, humourless and dry
Sitting like a cork on top of the town
One of these days I'm gonna blow you down

I jumped on a bus
A trusty number 23
To the Royal Botanical Gardens
Where a ghost was calling me
I saw a brace of weeping willows
A burnt and withered land
I saw a man and a little boy
Holding hands

I scanned the skyline
It was like the backdrop of a play
I never saw your heartless beauty
Until I'd been away
As I was climbing up The mound
It struck me like a chime
I must have dreamed this scene
About a thousand times !

Edinburgh Castle hugging the sky
Cold grey stone, humourless and dry
Sitting like a cork on top of the town
One of these days I'm gonna blow you down

I found myself on Forrest Road
Feeling pretty sore
This city once was mine
But it ain't mine anymore
And here's my old school, "Jingling Geordie's"
And I must confess
I couldn't step through that gate
Until I'm better dressed

Back at Waverly Station
Half dead on my feet
I got on board the four forty-four
Promptly fell asleep
I woke up in Queen Street
At my journey's end
I've got to say it's totally great
To be back in Glasgow again !

Edinburgh Castle hugging the sky
Cold grey stone, humourless and dry
Sitting like a cork on top of my town
One of these days I'm gonna blow you down
