He's fine, don't make no sound, he's fine
She's fine, but been around
Said to her, there's beauty, but all she sees is pain

He's fine, don't be unkind, he's fine
She's fine, but wasting time
Said to her, there's beauty, but all she sees is pain

He's fine, don't get no sign, he's fine
She's fine, she's fine, she is fine
Said to her, there's beauty, but all she sees is pain
Said to her, there's beauty in your eyes
In your eyes
In your eyes
In your eyes
