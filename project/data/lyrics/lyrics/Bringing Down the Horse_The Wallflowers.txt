Once upon a time, they called me the bleeder
I'm swimmin' up this river with sentimental fever
But this ain't my first ride, it ain't my last try
Just got to keep movin' on
If they catch me ever, they'll throw me back forever

I guess I should be ashamed
But I forget to be vain
I did the best I could I guess
But everything just bleeds
They say you're only sad and lonely
And no one is impressed

I sent it off in a letter, I need somethin' better
We'll then nail an' hammer to put me back together
But this ain't my first ride, it ain't my last try
Just got to keep a movin' on
Gotta keep this together, maybe next time is never

I guess I should be ashamed
But I forget to be vain
I did the best I could I guess
But everything just bleeds
They say you're only sad and lonely
And no one is impressed

Sometimes I must confess
I do feel a lil' overdressed
Sometimes it's hard to tell the wishing from the well
Where you threw the penny and where it fell

I guess I should be ashamed
But I forget to be vain
I did the best I could I guess
But everything just bleeds

I guess I should be ashamed
But I forget to be vain
I did the best I could I guess
But everything just bleeds
They say you're only sad and lonely
And no one is impressed
