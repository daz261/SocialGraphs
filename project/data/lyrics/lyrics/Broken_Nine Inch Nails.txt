[Verse 1]
This is the first day of my last days
I built it up, now I take it apart
Climbed up real high, now fall down real far
No need for me to stay
The last thing left, I just threw it away
I put my faith in god and my trust in you
Now there's nothing more fucked up I could do

[Chorus]
Wish there was something real
Wish there was something true
Wish there was something real
In this world full of you

[Verse 2]
I'm the one without a soul
I'm the one with this big fucking hole
No new tale to tell
Twenty-six years, on my way to hell
Gotta listen to your big-time, hard-line, bad luck, fist-fuck
Don't think you're having all the fun
You know me, I hate everyone

[Chorus]
Wish there was something real
Wish there was something true
Wish there was something real
In this world full of you

[Bridge]
I want to but I can't turn back
But I want to, but I can't turn back
I want to but I can't turn back
But I want to, but I can't turn back

[Chorus]
Wish there was something real
Wish there was something true
Wish there was something real
In this world full of you
Wish there was something real
Wish there was something true
Wish there was something real
In this world full of you

[Outro]
This world full of you
This world full of you
This world full

 

[Verse 1]
Gave up trying to figure it out, but my head got lost along the way
Worn out from giving it up, but my soul I pissed it all away
Still stings these shattered nerves
Pigs we get what pigs deserve
I'm going all the way down, I'm leaving today

[Chorus 1]
Come, come, come on you've gotta fill me up
Come, come, gotta let me inside of you
Come, come, come on you've gotta fix me up
Come, come, gotta let me inside of you

[Verse 2]
Still feel it all slipping away but it doesn't matter anymore
Everybody's still chipping away but it doesn't matter anymore
Look through these blackened eyes
You'll see ten thousand lies
My lips may promise but my heart is a whore

[Chorus 2]
Come, come, come on you've gotta fix me up
Come, come, gotta let me inside of you
Come, come, come on you've gotta fill me up
Come, come, gotta let me get through to you

[Hook]
This isn't meant to last
This is for right now
This isn't meant to last
This is for right now
This isn't meant to last
This is for right now
This isn't meant to last
This is for right

[Verse 3]
I know it's all getting away, and it comes to me as no surprise
I know what's coming to me is never going to arrive
Fresh blood through tired skin
New sweat to drown me in
Dress up this rotten carcass just to make it look alive

[Chorus 1]
Come, come, come on you've gotta fill me up
Come, come, gotta let me inside of you
Come, come, come on you've gotta fix me up
Come, come, gotta let me inside of you

[Hook]
This isn't meant to last
This is for right now
This isn't meant to last
This is for right now
This isn't meant to last
This is for right now
This isn't meant to last
This is for right now

This isn't meant to last
This is for right now
This isn't meant to last
This is for right now
This isn't meant to last
This is for right now
This isn't meant to last
This is for right

[Outro]
I wish I could put the blame on you
I want you to make me
I want you to take me
I want you to break me
Then I want you to throw me away
I want you to make me
I want you to take me
I want you to break me
Then I want you to throw me away
I want you to make me
I want you to take me
I want you to break me
Then I want you to throw me away
I want you to make me
I want you to take me
I want you to break me
Then I want you to throw me away
