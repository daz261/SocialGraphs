Two lanes - twistin' down a dusty highway
Two souls - on their way to where it leads
Tail lights - fadin' on the far horizon
But there's a detour on the road to destiny
It goes up in a blinding flash
When two reckless worlds collide
You can't avoid the crash
Sometimes in life we ride on

Divided highway - torn in two directions
Speedin' out of sight through the night
Divided highway - stranded at the crossroads
Of what's wrong and who's right

Two hearts forgettin' what they meant to each other
Too proud ever to admit the truth
Someday it'll all seem clear
When two reckless worlds collide
It's gonna turn to tears
Why must we always ride a divided highway

On the road baby no-one's safe
When two reckless worlds collide
When we defend our faith
That's when in life we ride a divided highway

Shuttin' out the other side
Divided highway clingin' to our foolish pride
Out on the road nowhere; nowhere to hide

Why must we always ride a divided highway
Torn in two directions; speedin' outa sight
Divided highway stranded at the crossroads
Of what's wrong and who's right
Divided highway cuttin' through the darkness

Searchin' for the light
Divided highway ridin' on the fine line
Between day and nite
Divided highway
