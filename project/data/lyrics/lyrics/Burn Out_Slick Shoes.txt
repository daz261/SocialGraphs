Thrown out in the cold again
We don抰 have a place for you here
You did everything shy of call me stupid
Why not take this comfort away
You抳e got everything else
Don抰 worry about me, I抣l be fine
It抯 all right now, I抳e found my way
No thanks to you I抣l be O. K
You抳e showed me how to mistrust
No thanks to you I抣l be O. K
Could you come and walk with me and help me not to stray?
I need your strength to guide me
So show me how to trust and to know faith
I抳e paid a price I now
Not standing up for my beliefs
What抯 inside won抰 be held back I know that with your love I will find peace
