Spiritual Isolation; the ultimate frustration
Scratch the surface, turn another page
The ugly truth or another pretty lie?
You deceived me, I believed you
Why did everything go...

So wrong
For so long?
So the truth comes out at last
So wrong
For so long
So the truth comes out at last

I'm dead inside
A hollow shell
In my own misery
You leave me to dwell
I'm burning up
My private hell
In my own misery
You leave me to dwell

Then we were young and strong
Now everything is wrong
Did you want me, did you need me
Could you not say you believed me?
Everything we had is gone
Like an old forgotten song
The deceiver and believer
Now everything is...

So wrong
For so long
So the truth comes out at last
So wrong
For so long
So the truth comes out at last

I'm dead inside
A hollow shell
In my own misery
You leave me to dwell
I'm burning up
My private hell
In my own misery
You leave me to dwell

Soooo wroooong
Foooor sooo looooong
