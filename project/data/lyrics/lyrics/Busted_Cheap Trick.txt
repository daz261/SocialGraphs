When my world is turning
When it's turning upside down
When all I see is rain
When I think the night won't end
I just think of you
And I can see the sun again

Wherever would I be without you, tell me
If I didn't have you
Whatever would I do now baby
Whatever would I be without you
I'd be nowhere I'd be nowhere

When the dreams I dream
All seem a million miles away
When I'm sure I'll never win
When it's looking like I've left my faith
I just look at you baby
And I got reason to believe again

Wherever would I be without you, tell me
If I didn't have you
Whatever would I do now baby
Whatever would I be without you
I'd be nowhere I'd be nowhere

Without you to love me
I'd just be wasting time
And goin' out of my mind

Wherever would I be without you, tell me
If I didn't have you
Whatever would I do now baby
Whatever would I be without you
I'd be nowhere I'd be nowhere

Wherever would I be without you, tell me
If I didn't have you
Whatever would I do now baby
Whatever would I be without you
I'd be nowhere I'd be nowhere

Wherever would I be without you, tell me
If I didn't have you
Whatever would I do now baby
Whatever would I be without you
I'd be nowhere I'd be nowhere

 

Girl it's all right if it's one of those nights and you need me
Swallow your pride there's nothing to hide, Do you need me?
Such a long long time I've been waiting for a sign Say you need me
I've been dreaming of the day when I hear you say, say you need me

I believe in you, you believe in me but I can't feel it in my heart
So what's wrong with you, what's the matter with me
And how come we're so far apart

I can stand a little hurt and I can stand a lot of pain
We can work it out all right if you need me

Can we be serious can you and I keep a secret?
Hold it inside between you and I, Can you keep it?
Been thinking of a way just to get you to say, say you need me
Such a long, long time I've been waiting for a sign, say you need me

I believe in you you believe in me but I can't feel it in my heart
So what's wrong with you, what's the matter with me
And how come we're so far apart

I can stand a little hurt and I can stand a lot of pain
We can work it out all right if you need me
And I just wanna let you know that we don't have to let it go
You know we can work it out all right if you need me

 

How does it feel to be on you own
While the night slips away
You toss and turn like a ship in the storm
Have you lost your way
I can see by the look in your eyes
Youve been hurt before
Hold me close like the very first time
Cause thats what love is for

Theres no reason to cry cause ill be there beside you
When you need someone
I'd never leave you
I swear that you will be the only one through the sorrow and pain
Just call out my name when you need someone
I'd sleep forever I swear that you would never be the only one when you need someone

Sometimes the world can be so cold and you dont know why
Youre reaching out but theres no one to hold in times rushing by
I can see by the look in your eyes you just can't let go
Hold me close and together we'll find just what love is for

Theres no reason to cry cause i'll be there beside you when you need someone
I'd never leave you I swear that you would be the only one
Through the sorrow and pain just call out my name when you need someone
Id sleep forever I swear that you would never be the lonely one when you need
Someone

When you need someone its a long long day when you need someone
It's a crawl and change
When you need someone you can call out my name

Theres no reason to cry cause i'll be there beside you when you need someone...
