[Verse 1]
Table of deranged, savage brutal being
Shocking way of life, living on human offspring
Murder of the innocent, pale gray face
Expressionless, horrid dismemberment
One person's tortures is another's pleasure
Malformation, a diseased brain

[Bridge]
Unsuspecting slowly dying
As his knife invades the child
Screams of pain, no one hears
Blood splotches now appear
Ecstacy through each cut
Now the body twitches
Gutted little torso
Ready to be cooked

[Verse 2]
Isolated in his own mind, need to kill now possesses
His body, self mutilated
Between killings, ejaculation
Cut off appendages of former victims
Sexual violence satisfaction
Disembodied corpses, spewing gore
On his body, soaked with their fluids
Various digestive parts, and assorted meats
Plunging his fist down the throat
Ripping out the guts, internal extraction

[Bridge]
Entire body bleeding, heart stops pumping
Child lying dead, just another gutted infant
To satisfy his hunger, temptations of the flesh
Voracious appetite

[Verse 3]
Killing to release pure souls to heavens
Justification of his killing
Self-torture, stiffening pain
He sees the faces of the dead
Guts are strewn from the children
Splintered bones, poke through skin
Gratification through castration
Roasting parts for consumption

 

[Chorus]
Fingers missing from hands
Ready to snap bones and necks
Pierced together from dead tissue
Body parts crudely sewn
Face is smashed to pulp
Drooling from empty socket
Brain half dead, hungry for flesh
Many souls commanding my existence

[Post-Chorus]
My body alive, I defy, life I've been given
Should've remained dead

[Verse 1]
Experimenting on dead tissue
Convulsing bodies on the table
Reanimation of the dead
Rusty scalpels cutting skin
Pieced together parts and parts
Transplanting human life
Rotten organs, restal pus
Spitting up your galbladde

[Bridge]
Donation of bodily organs, carved from broken bodies
Eyes melting, skin exploding, every bloody bleeding
Meat inter-changed from the mutalated stiffs, parts of the dead are never to rest
Lymphatic nodes, implode, while brain corrodes
Bodies sold to science, profiting from the dead
Creation of a being never known to man

[Verse 2]
Pumping pus through the body
Sliced in sections, putrid infection
Regaining life from beyond
To rip the flesh from your bones
Stripped of flesh, unsightly
Torn in two, slicing through you
Live organs needed to be reanimated
Pathologist sawing the skull of the donor
Now he lies dead, awaiting a new brain

[Bridge]
Re-cycling the bodies, parts of the dead
Exposing their insides, slitting their necks
Finding a way, bringing life to the corpse
One dead on my table, soon to walk again

[Chorus]
Fingers missing from hands
Ready to snap bones and necks
Pierced together from dead tissue
Body parts crudely sewn
[?]

[Post-Chorus]
My body alive, I defy, life I've been given
Should've remained dead
