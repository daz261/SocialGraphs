When you're lost
I am found
When you slip
I hold my ground
When I fall
Please take a bow
And when you're up
Just remember I am down

People looking for
Fortune and fame
They don't know
That it's all the same
It's like any other game
You know there's a loser
But it's all right

When you feel your heart is breaking
When all your friends are faking
When it's giving and no taking
I will be by your side

I've been over the hill and back
Survived every kind of attack
It's been a few years at that
As a matter of fact

Good luck is just good luck
You don't go hungry if you got pot luck
I've been down
But never on my knees
I see the forest for the trees
