[Verse 1]
I'm so glad you're my girl, I'll do anything for you
Call you every night, and give you flowers too
I thank the Lord for you and think about you all the time
I ask Him everyday that you'll forever be mine

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna hold your hand to show you I'll be there
I like to do the things that let you know I care
I sing this lullaby 'cause girl you fill me full
I look into your eyes, you're so beautiful

[Chorus]
Oh girl, I think I love ya
I'm always thinkin' of ya
I want ya to know I do it all 4 love
I love it when we're together
Girl, I need you forever
And I want you to know I do it all for love

[Verse 2]
I will never leave you sugar, this I guarantee
I look into the future, I see you and me
Knight in shining armor, I will be your fairy tale
I wanna take care of you, girl, I'll serve you well

[Pre-Chorus]
I will be there for ya, to catch you when you fall
I'll hold you in my arms, that's were you belong
I sing this lullaby, 'cause girl you fill me full
I look into your eyes, you're so beautiful
Beautiful, yeah

[Chorus]
Oh girl, I think I love ya
I'm always thinkin' of ya
I want ya to know I do it all for love
I love it when we're together
Girl, I need you forever
And I want you to know I do it all for love

[Interlude]
Yo, come here, sweetheart
I want you to know something, alright?
See, everyday in my life without you would be like a hundred years
The distance between us, an ocean of tears
See all the things I do for you are for love
Dig it

[Bridge]
All for lovin' (All for love)
All for you (You, you, you)
All for lovin' you (You, you, you)

[Chorus]
Oh girl, I think I love ya
I'm always thinkin' of ya
I want ya to know I do it all for love
I love it when we're together (When we're together)
Girl, I need you forever
I want you to know I do it all for love
Oh girl, I think I love ya
I'm always thinkin' of ya
I want you to know I do it all for love
I love it when we're together
Girl, I need you forever
I want you to know I do it all for love
Oh girl, I think I love ya
I'm always thinkin' of ya
All for love
I love it when we're together
Girl, I need you forever
