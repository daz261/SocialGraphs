[Verse 1]
Write in passing when there's time
Hide the paper, hide my mind
(Talk late, words, advice)
Keep you quiet, keep you blind
(Talk late, time flies)
Don't rock the boat, don't read the sign
(Watch, wait, words, lies)

[Pre-Chorus]
You're my co-pilot
Not my god pilot

[Chorus]
You take everything
You take what I want
You take everything
You take what I...

[Verse 2]
Want from you is so defined
Your suit and tie, your shiny smile
(Talk late, words, advice)
Your calm belief, your piece of mind
(Talk late, time flies)
I'll trade you for it, then run, then fly
(Watch, wait, words, lies)

[Pre-Chorus]
You're my co-pilot
Not my god pilot

[Chorus]
You take everything
You take what I want
You take everything
You take what I want

[Outro]
You take what I want
You take what I want
You take what I want

 

Damn you, damn you!

Smile pretty, take, take the money
You know me well, oh, don't you?
Smile pretty, take, take the money
You know how to sell?
I do

I'm your little, I'm your little
I'm your little mouth
Did ya want me?
I'm your little, I'm your little
I'm your little mouth
Did ya want me?

Damaged goods
Damaged goods
Damaged goods
Damaged goods

Oh, you wanna try her?
Oh, I think I wanna
Oh, you wanna try her?
Oh, I think I wanna

Oh, you wanna try her?
Oh, I think I wanna
Oh, you wanna try her?
Oh, I think I wanna

'Cause I'm your little, I'm your little
I'm your little mouth
Did ya want me?
I'm your little, I'm your little
I'm your little mouth
Did ya want me?

Damaged goods
Damaged goods

Oh, you wanna try her?
Oh, I think I wanna
Oh, you wanna try her?
Oh, I think I wanna

Oh, you wanna try her?
Oh, I think I wanna
Oh, you wanna try her?
Oh, I think I wanna

'Cause I'm your little, I'm your little
I'm your little mouth
Did ya want me?
I'm your little, I'm your little
I'm your little mouth
Did ya want me?

Damn you!
