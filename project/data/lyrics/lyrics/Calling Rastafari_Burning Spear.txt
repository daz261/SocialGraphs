And let us all think out of line
Sometimes they confuse our minds
And let us all think out of line

No unnecessary confusion
No unnecessary Behavior
No unnecessary confusion
No unnecessary Behavior

So remember Marcus Garvey
And his African legendary parade

And his African legendary parade
Lots of people in high places

Come on now people let the good time roll
Come on now people let the good time roll

A letter to the people, fans
People all over
People in general
Little singers and big singers
It's we who build this foundation
This reggae foundation
Yes my soldiers be strong
We all travel the same roads
We all make the same stops
We all play the same music
Yes my soldiers be strong
