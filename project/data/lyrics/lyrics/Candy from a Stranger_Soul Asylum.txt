Doorways open up and close more ways to a punchline
They're all laughing at your clothes, standing in the lunch line
You're the talk of the town, first you're up, then you're down
It's a cycle, I've found, it always comes around

But I will still be laughing
Yes, I will still be laughing

Air raids in the afternoon, the children are playing
Switchblades, colored red balloons, no one hears your praying
And it comes back to you, all the things that you do
Will come looking for you, they'll come looking for you

But I will still be laughing
Yes, I will still be laughing

Doorways lead to other rooms, always leave you lying
Face down in a stranger's tomb, didn't know you were dying
And you rise and you fall, and you wait for the call
You're watching the walls, you're watching the walls

But I will still be laughing
I will still be laughing

Yes, I will still be laughing
I will still be laughing laughing laughing laughing
Laughing
I will still be laughing
Yes, I will still be laughing laughing...
