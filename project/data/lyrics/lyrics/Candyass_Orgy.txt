[Verse 1]
If it stayed I'd never leave it
If that turned around
I'd grieve the special dirty things
That we used to talk about
I mean that loving you is strange
And adored by me throughout
Oh no, it's you again
Someday soon you'll find that someone
Waiting for the chance to beat you
Drooling on the set to feel you
Blessing you with every kiss

[Chorus]
Tying yourself to me
Stitch up my emptiness
'Cause you're the death of me
So precious, loving the thrill
Tying yourself to me
Stitch up my emptiness
'Cause you're the death of me
So precious, loving the thrill

[Verse 2]
It's such the patient one who needs me
The spoiled one who wins
So shocking where's yours sense
Don't you know I hate you ooh
Unsatisfied, you little girl

[Chorus]
Tying yourself to me
Stitch up my emptiness
'Cause you're the death of me
So precious, loving the thrill
Tying yourself to me
Stitch up my emptiness
'Cause you're the death of me
So precious, loving the thrill

[Bridge]
Rolling dice and seeming queer
Bastard love a sick affair
Let's see what new disease you'll fetch
I mean that fucking you is strange
And adored by me throughout
Oh no, it's you again, blessing you with every kiss
So precious, you know this hate of mine exploded
I'm so deranged, you know I will never be deceived

[Chorus]
Tying yourself to me
Stitch up my emptiness
'Cause you're the death of me
So precious, loving the thrill
Tying yourself to me
Stitch up my emptiness
'Cause you're the death of me
So precious, loving the thrill

[Outro]
So precious, loving the thrill
So precious, loving the thrill
'Cause you're the death of me
So precious, loving the thrill
