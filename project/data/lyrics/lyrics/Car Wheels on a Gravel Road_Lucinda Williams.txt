[Verse 1]
You can't depend on anything, really
There's no promises, there's no point
There's no good, there's no bad
In this dirty little joint

[Pre-Chorus]
No dope smoking, no beer sold after 12 o'clock
Rosedale, Mississippi, Magic City Juke Joint
Mr. Johnson sings over in a corner by the bar
Sold his soul to the devil so he can play guitar

[Chorus]
Too cool to be forgotten
Hey, hey, too cool to be forgotten

[Verse 2]
Man runnin' through the grass outside
Says he wants to take up serpents
Says he will drink the deadly thing
And it will not hurt him

[Pre-Chorus]
House rules, no exceptions
No bad language, no gambling, no fighting
Sorry, no credit, don't ask
Bathroom wall reads: Is God the answer? Yes

[Chorus]
Too cool to be forgotten
Hey, hey, too cool to be forgotten
June bug versus hurricane
June bug versus hurricane
Hey, hey

[Verse 3]
I had a lover
I thought he was mine
Thought I'd always be
His valentine

[Pre-Chorus]
Leaning against the railing of a Lake Charles bridge
Overlooking the river, leaning over the edge
He asked me: Would you jump into the water with me
I told him: No way, baby, that's your own death you see

[Chorus]
Too cool to be forgotten
Hey, hey, too cool to be forgotten
June bug versus hurricane
June bug versus hurricane

[Outro]
Hey, hey
Hey, hey
Hey, hey
