Chopped in half
Feel the blood spill from your mouth
With rotting ways comes destiny
Feel the soul taking over
Bleed...

Chopped in half
Feel the blood spill from your mouth
With rotting ways comes destiny
Feel the soul taking over
Bleed...

Chopped in half
Feel the blood spill from your mouth
With rotting ways comes destiny
Feel the soul taking over
Bleed...

 

After the battle is over
And the sand's drunken the blood
All what there remains
Is the bitterness of delusion

The immortality of the Gods
Sits at their side
As they leave the walls behind
To reach the jewels gleam

The days have come
When the steel will rule
And upon his head
A crown of gold

Your hand wields the might
The tyrant's the precursor
You carry the will
As the morning is near

I sing the ballads
Of victory and defeat
I hear the tales
Of frozen mystery

The new kingdoms rise
By the circle of the tyrants
In the land of darkness
The warrior, that was me
Grotesque glory
None will (ever) see them fall
And hunts and wars
Are like everlasting shadows

Where the winds cannot reach
The tyrant's might was born
And often I look back
With tears in my eyes
Grotesque glory
None will (ever) see them fall
And hunts and wars
Are like everlasting shadows

 

We're dying
For our souls to learn

We're dying
For our souls to burn

We're dying
For our souls to learn
We're dying
