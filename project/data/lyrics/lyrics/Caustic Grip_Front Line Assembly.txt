"As the first jolt of electricity was sent through his body"
"A ghastly column of smoke that rose from her head"

Break with me
We, we, we collapse
Its, its over
Hanging from above

You, you, you, wake up screaming!
You, you, you, eat us all!

Borrow children with
Annihilate ???
The closer you come
The closer you see
The faster

I switch off, Seeing you
I switch off, Seeing you
Annihilate, Annihilate
??
Overkill
We collapse
Mediate
Digital oppression

My soul is burning
You, kill ?? in your ??

"When she was given more electricity"
"A ghastly column of smoke that rose from her head"
"When it appeared that she had recieved enough electricity
To kill an ordinary person...the doctors went over and pulled
Down the cheap prison...."

We'll, conceive a trial
?? resist ??
Through you
Lie and ??
Lie, ready to follow
Lie, ready to kill
??
Shot right through

I switch off
I switch off
I annihilate
I collapse
I overkill
I manipulate
I celebrate
I excuse
I frustrate
I overkill

You wake up screaming

"When it appeared that she had recieved enough electricity...
"...to kill an ordinary person"
"As the first jolt of electricity was sent through his body"
