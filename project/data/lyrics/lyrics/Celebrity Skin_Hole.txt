[Verse 1]
Put me up above the boy
The one I love, I should destroy
My sweet tooth has burned a hole
Forget about it all

[Chorus]
He hit so hard
I saw stars
He hit so hard
I saw God

[Verse 2]
He's cold, give him a candycoat
He can't swim but he can float
One by one, they all fall down
I look at him and drown

[Chorus]
He hit so hard
I saw stars
He hit so hard
I saw God

[Post-Chorus]
(I saw God) Just one big shiny flash
(God) Your secret's safe tonight
(God) So much, so much to lose
(God) So glad that we're alive

[Verse 3]
He's so candy, my downfall
Melts in my mouth 'till he's nothing at all
This keeps me, I can't sleep
He rages to be true

[Chorus]
He hit so hard
I saw stars
He hit so hard
I saw God

[Post-Chorus]
(I saw God) Just one big shiny flash
(God) Oh, set me straight tonight
(God) Look at the pretty lights
(God)

[Chorus]
Oh, man, he hit so hard
I saw stars
He hit so hard
I saw God

[Outro]
I saw God
