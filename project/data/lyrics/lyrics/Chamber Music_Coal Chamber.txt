[Verse One]
Cynics and Christ-like hypocrites
How they stick to you like glue
Jealous and thoughtless lunatics
How they stick to you like glue

[Chorus]
Truth is like a tragedy
Truth is like a tragedy
Truth is like a tragedy
Truth is like a tragedy
Truth is like a tragedy

[Verse Two]
Unclean undeniably surely
How they stick to you like glue
Offensive and corrupt
How they seem to fuck with you
So fuck you

[Chorus]
Truth is like a tragedy
Truth is like a tragedy
Truth is like a tragedy
Truth is like a tragedy
Truth is like a tragedy

[Bridge]
Come with me I cannot lie
I'll tell the truth I cannot lie
Well I cannot I cannot I cannot I cannot lie
Well I cannot I cannot I cannot I cannot lie
Well I cannot I cannot I cannot I cannot lie
Well I cannot I cannot I cannot I cannot lie

[Verse Three]
Cynics and Christ-like hypocrites
How they stick to you like glue
Jealous and thoughtless lunatics
How they fuck with you
So fuck you

[Chorus]
Truth is like a tragedy
Truth is like a tragedy
Truth is like a tragedy
Truth is like a tragedy
Truth is like a tragedy

[Bridge]
Come with me I cannot lie
I'll tell the truth I cannot lie
Well I cannot I cannot I cannot I cannot lie
Well I cannot I cannot I cannot I cannot lie
Well I cannot I cannot I cannot I cannot lie
Well I cannot I cannot I cannot I cannot lie

[Chorus]
Truth is like a tragedy
Truth is like a tragedy
Truth is like a tragedy
Truth is like a tragedy
Truth is like a tragedy

Truth

 

[Intro]
There's a point in time when you can't think for yourself
Paulie - shots

[Verse One]
I'm placeable
Listen to the dreams you're dreaming
Untraceable
Tell me now what are you scheming?
I'm placeable
To the place where you most fear
Untraceable
So help me dear

[Chorus]
I'm placeable
Innate yet surely substantial
To repay your fade-away
Sweetness smells so sweet
At your feet
Just to repay your fade-away

[Verse Two]
I'm placeable
I have no place now
Untraceable
To your jaded vows
I'm placeable
No more of your face
I'm placeable
So help me please

[Chorus]
I'm placeable
Innate yet surely substantial
To repay your fade-away
Sweetness smells so sweet
At your feet
Just to repay your fade-away

[Bridge]
Kill the man become the monster
Kill the man become the monster
Kill the man become the monster
Kill the man become the monster
Kill the man become the monster
You are a sick individual
You are so sincere
I'm the one
Get under your bed
Increase your dreams and you know it well
Yeah I'm the one
Get under your bed
Increase your dreams and I know it well
Hell

[Verse Three]
I'm placeable
Recognize that you're most favored
Untraceable
Tell me now what are we made of
I'm placeable
To the place where you most fear
Untraceable
So help me dear

[Chorus]
I'm placeable
Innate yet surely substantial
To repay your fade-away
Sweetness smells so sweet
At your feet
Just to repay your fade-away

[Bridge]
Kill the man become the monster
Kill the man become the monster
Kill the man become the monster
Kill the man become the monster
Kill the man become the monster
You are a sick individual
You are so sincere
I'm the one
Get under your bed
Increase your dreams and you know it well
Yeah I'm the one
Get under your bed
Increase your dreams and I know it well
Hell

[Outro]
Kill the man
Become the monster
Kill the man
Become the monster
Kill the man
Become the monster
Kill the man
Become the monster
Kill the man
Become the monster
Kill the man
Become the monster
Kill the man
Become the monster
Kill the man
Become the monster
Kill the man
Become the monster
Kill the man
Become the monster
Kill the man
Become the monster

Sincere
