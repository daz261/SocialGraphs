I still don't believe it, how much we lied
Last night you made it with him now I'm supposed to be dignified
Just like a man

Well I spend my night-times drinking and you spend your days in bed
And I guess it's up to us to choose the methods by which we forget

And just like a man he holds you gently
And just like a man he strokes your hair
And just like a man I still pretend that I'm
Immune to the whole affair

But I wanna die, I wanna cry, I wanna tell you that I was wrong
Yeah I wanna die, I wanna cry but it's too late
So I soldier on just like a man

I don't believe it, you were easy to leave but now
I do my best to relieve it in the only way that I know how
Just like a man

And I don't wanna possess you, and I don't wanna take his place
But I don't wanna see my last few pleasures written all over his face

And just like a man he holds you gently
And just like a man he strokes your hair
And just like a man I still pretend that I'm
Immune to the whole affair

But I wanna die, I wanna cry, I wanna tell you I was wrong
Yeah I wanna die, I wanna cry but it's too late
So I soldier on just like a man

And I have something to tell you but it doesn't matter now
I'll stick to small talk and leave the little bits of flattery to him
I could call you but why would I bother to
You might not be in or he might misunderstand
Just like a man

 

Look at the fool you have been
They drained the pool while you drowned in the dream
They bought your beauty and your soul
Then softly sold you back what they stole

So look into the mirror do you recognise someone
Is it who you always hoped you would become
When you were young

The disappointment of success
Hangs from your shoulders like a hand-me-down dress
And down nostalgia's rocky road
You watch your former lovers growing old

So look into the mirror do you recognise someone
Is it who you always hoped you would become
When you were young

Sometimes your lack of sympathy gets hard to explain
So on your mask of make-up you just paint
A little parody of pain

So I look into the mirror and I recognise someone
It is who you always hoped you would become
When you were young
