Will there be another breakdown
Communication is a let down
When you speak is it easy
Your trying too hard to please me

Speak easy, easy

I know what you think
I think the same things as you
And do the things that you do
Don't break the habit of a lifetime
You broke the habit of a lifetime
I see through everything you do

Will there ever be a right sound
Communication is a let down
You wouldn't speak for a million
Give me your honest opinion
In your own words

Speak easy, easy

I know what you think
I think the same things as you
And do the things that you do
Don't break the habit of a lifetime
You broke the habit of a lifetime
I see through everything you do

Speak easy, easy

I know what you think
I think the same things as you
And do the things that you do
Don't break the habit of a lifetime
You broke the habit of a lifetime
I see through everything you do
I see through everything you do
Don't break the habit of a lifetime
You broke the habit of a lifetime
