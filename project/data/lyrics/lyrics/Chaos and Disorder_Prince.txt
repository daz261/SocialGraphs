[Verse 1]
Anyone can tell I love you
Anyone can tell I care
Twice an hour I'm thinking of you
Around your waist I want to be there

[Chorus]
On your heavenly body I swear
I like it there

[Verse 2]
Anyone can see what's come over me
Don't you know it's 'cause of you
I'm in a daze but that's the way it's gotta be
Let me count the ways I'm digging you
Digging you, baby
I'm digging you, baby
I hope you're digging me too

[Chorus]
Baby, I like it there
I like it there
I like it there
On your heavenly body I swear
I like it there

[Verse 3]
Can I count the ways that I'm digging you/
I hope you're digging me too

[Chorus]
Baby, I like it there
I like it there
I like it there, that's right
On your heavenly body I swear
I like it there


[Bridge]
Every damn day I please you
What can I say Shakespeare hasn't said before?
Like an embryo, baby
Don't abort this dire need for you
All my emotional ejaculate on the floor (On the floor)
And what's more, what's more
Your heavenly body, baby
I swear (I swear), I swear
I like it there
Yeah

[Chorus]
I like it there
I like it there
I like it there

On your heavenly body I swear
I like it there
