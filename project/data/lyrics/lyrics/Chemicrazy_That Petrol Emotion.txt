Sitting all alone gnaw mark on my face
You're Cuban heel stamped into place
I start shaken I know why
You switch on my TV eye

Sixth sense from a loaded gun
Sixth sense I feel must be won

Standing all alone when it's way too late
Love me and seal my fate
Tense and nervous can't break in
Find me I'll make you spin

Sixth sense from a loaded gun
Sixth sense I feel just begun

Sitting all alone gnaw mark on my face
No mohaired goon's gonna take my place
Fueled fever that's hard to kick
Bend me I've dug my ditch

Sixth sense from a loaded gun
Sixth sense I feel so alone
Sixth sense from a loaded gun
Sixth sense I feel must be won

 

Torn through a faded sky
Sunk smoothly
Your faded smile
I know why
I'll bet you think that this is goodbye
Frail fragrance of compulsion
Dark seeds of indignation and
Fascination
I said to always thank what I've done

Confused where frightened hopes lie
Let loose when silent dreams die
I know why
I never meant to break down and cry

I know why
I'll bet you think that this is goodbye

 

Sometimes I couldn't care if you ran out of air oh no
You see my star kid groover's holding tight on the reins of my heart

It's a breeze she's a tease we were made for the trees
How I want her like this
How I love when she feeds me her Tingle

She's my mudhoney child as we dance on the waves on the street
You see my all time mover's boppin' hard from her head to her feet

It's a gas it's a treat not a hint of deceit
How I want her like this
How I love when she feeds me her Tingle

So so
Why do we always keep looking back
Feelin' joy feelin' pain we're exactly the same
I can't change what always remain oh no no no

So so
Why do we always keep looking back
Feelin' joy feelin' pain we're exactly the same
I can't change what always remain oh no no no

Subterranean spark won't you fill up the dark with your Tingle
Subterranean spark won't you fill up the dark with your Tingle
Subterranean spark won't you fill up the dark with your Tingle
Subterranean spark won't you fill up the dark with your Tingle

 

12 seconds into my past
I don't remember so I don't even ask
Just let it drop
Just let it drop
Just let it drop drop drop drop drop

A private white-out that numbs my thoughts
You keep yourself warm with the line you bought
Breath in Breath out
Breath in Breath out
Breath out out out out

Nasty habit let me grab at it
Nasty habit let me grab at it

Head Staggered
Head Staggered
Head Staggered

5 o'clock fever will bite
Desire for virtue but the wrong is right
So tell me when tell me when
Now
So tell me when tell me when
Now Now Now

Dreams that ticker-tape and blur
I call your name out but the words are slurred
The words are slurred
The words are slurred
The words are slurred slurred slurred

Nasty habit let me grab at it
Nasty habit let me grab at it

Head Staggered
Head Staggered
Head Staggered
Head
Head
Head
Head
Head
Head
Head

 

Sunset tears
This crummy town will squeeze you
Cling to fears
The ones you've always known
Good as gold
And twice as hard to part with
Truth be told
I just can't explain
Stand and wait
Nod at fate
It's too late
Now you've been smothered whole

Sweet shiver burn
Sweet shiver burn

Endless roads
The final flame will daze you
Skyline prayers
The one's you've always dreamed
Don't hesitate
Smile at fate
It's so right
That you've been smothered whole

Sweet shiver burn
Sweet shiver burn
Sweet shiver burn

Sweet shiver burn
Sweet shiver burn
Sweet shiver burn
Sweet shiver burn
Sweet shiver burn
