[Verse 1]
Baby, since you left me, there's somebody new
She thinks I'm perfect, I swear
She likes my body, my class and my charm
She says I've got a confident air
She respects my ambition, thinks I'm talented too
But she's in love with an image time is bound to see through

[Chorus]
Oh/But you know me better than that
You know the me that gets lazy and fat
How moody I can be, all my insecurities
You've seen me lose all my charm, you know I was raised on a farm
Oh, she tells her friends I'm perfect
And that I love her cat, but you know me better than that

[Verse 2]
I miss picnics and blue jeans and buckets of beer
Now it's ballet and symphony hall
I'm into culture, clean up to my ears
It's like wearing a shoe that's too small
Oh I caught her with an issue of Brides magazine
Staring at dresses and picking out rings

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Oh she tells her friends I'm perfect and that I love that cat
Oh but you know me better than that
