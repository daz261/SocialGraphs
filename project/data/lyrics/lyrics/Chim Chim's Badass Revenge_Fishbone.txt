[Verse 1]
Well let me pull myself up and out
Of this toilet that I'm in
It's liberating for a little while
But living in shit with shit
And bein' all about shit ain't my style
So up to the front I go
Past the ass rim where the sun and the snow
Melt into a river of sprinkly clear water

[Pre-Chorus]
Deep in the toilet
Doo Deep Doo
I'm in the cube, in the cube
Deep in the toilet
Deep Doo Doo
I'm in the cube, in the cube

[Bridge]
Numb to the cold that I'm swimmin' in
I imagine a world without sin
Where there's mutual respect for every soul
With no question
And no testin' of no one's wits or individuality

[Pre-Chorus]
Deep in the toilet
Doo Deep Doo
I'm in the cube, in the cube

[Chorus]
I'm in the cube and I'm deep in the toilet
Way down deep where no good scent can spoil it
Where I can get respect from all the shit around me
As far a what comes down from above me

I'm in the cube and I'm deep in the toilet
Way down deep where no good scent can spoil it
It eventually turns into a degree of a flea
Down here I see the future of life to be

[Verse 3]
It's too crowded up here
Everybody's greedy and they just won't calm down
Their intentions are good
But they always get drowned by the ego overthrown
And the know-it-all hard-heads
That insist on running the show
The devil, the dookey that threatens my friends and me

[Pre-Chorus]
Deep in the toilet
Doo Deep Doo
I'm in the cube, in the cube
Deep in the toilet
Deep Doo Doo
I'm in the cube, in the cube

[Bridge 2]
Some get so caught up within the whirlpool of bad
That while trying to reach the good they still end up bein' sad
From trying to rush into helping God's plan

[Pre-Chorus]
Deep in the toilet
Doo Deep Doo
I'm in the cube, in the cube
Deep in the toilet
Deep Doo Doo
I'm in the cube, in the cube

[Chorus]
I'm in the cube and I'm deep in the toilet
Way down deep where no good scent can spoil it
Where I can get respect from all the shit around me
As far a what comes down from above me

I'm in the cube and I'm deep in the toilet
Way down deep where no good scent can spoil it
It eventually turns into a degree of a flea
Down here I see the future of life to be

[Bridge 3]
Back down I go to the toilet bowl roll
Where no one is and are afraid to go
I can find peace and tranquility
Amongst the peanuts and shit
The smell is only a bluff

Just to make me leave
From in the cube
This fucking cube

[Chorus 2]
In the cube, in the toilet, where no good scent can spoil it
Let's be real with ourselves, let's be real with ourselves
From the dirt we came, and from the dirt we shall return
This is a lesson in life we should all learn

I'm in the cube and I'm deep in the toilet
Way down deep where no good scent can spoil it
It eventually turns into a degree of a flea
Down here I see the future of life to be

[Bridge 4]
Cuzz no matter how much you stack it up high
It always goes down to the dirt where the shit fertilizes
Some don't realize we come from this dirt shit
Aaaah, the mineral pit

God made the devil
But the devil makes us weak sometimes
So are we fighting against a part of God
Or is a part of God's creation lying?
Let some woman or man
Deem himself special
Cuzz when your label is gone your road is long
Back to the minerals and vitamins Where you belong

[Pre-Chorus]
Deep in the toilet
Doo Deep Doo
I'm in the cube, in the cube
Deep in the toilet
Deep Doo Doo
I'm in the cube, in the cube
Deep in the toilet
Doo Deep Doo
I'm in the cube, in the cube
Deep in the toilet
Deep Doo Doo
I'm in the cube, in the cube

I'm in the cube
I'm in the toilet
I'm in the cube
I'm in the toilet, lord
