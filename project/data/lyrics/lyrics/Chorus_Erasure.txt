[Intro]
Ooh, oh
Oh

Ooh, oh
Oh

[Verse 1]
It was only for a fight
That I asked you to come in
But you brought me tumbling down
And the walls came caving in

Won't you help me dry my tears?
Help me roll away the years?
Then perhaps I will forgive you
And the hurt will disappear

[Pre-Chorus]
But in a fit of blind arrogance
You stood up and walked away
If you'd given me half a chance
I'll be waiting for the day

[Chorus]
For the day that you
Oh, come back to me
Come on back to me
You (oh) come back to me

[Verse 2]
So, forget the long goodbye
You never really tried
Threw the keys down on the table
You've got your sense of pride

Then you had to tell the world
Your story must be heard
Slammed the door behind you
Without a single word

[Pre-Chorus]
But, in a fit of blind arrogance
You stood up and walked away

[Chorus]
The day that you
Oh, come back to me
Come on back to me

You (oh) come back to me
Come on back to me

You (oh) come back to me

[Bridge]
No, I never had a single thought in my head
No, I never had a single thought

[Coda]
Oh, for the day that you
Oh, come back to me
Come on back to me

You (oh) come back to me
Come on back to me

[Coda]
You could be my lifelong friend
You could be the light of dawn
You could keep me close at hand
You could keep me safe and warm

(You)
I will be your fantasy
(Oh)
If you come and stay with me
(Come back to me)
I will try to give you all
Waiting for the night to fall

(The day that you)
You could be the light of day
(Oh)
You could be my lifelong friend
(Come back to me)
You could keep me close at hand
Waiting for the day to end

(You)
I will be your fantasy
(Oh)
If you come and stay with me
(Come back to me)
I will try to give my all
Waiting for the night to fall
