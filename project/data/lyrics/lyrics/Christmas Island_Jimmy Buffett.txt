[Chorus]
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to run in a one horse open sleigh
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way
Oh what fun on Jah's cool run in a one horse open sleigh

[Verse 1]
We're dashing through the snow
In a one horse open sleigh
And o'er the fields we go
A laughing all the way
The bells on bob-tail ring
They're making spirits bright
What fun it is to ride and sing a sleighing song tonight

[Verse 2]
A day or two ago
I thought I'd make a run
To Port Antonio
I be cruisin' in the sun
The radio was loud
The chicken jerked and fried
And all I had to do that day was drive on the left side
