Oh my blue-eyed boy
Built something to destroy
Is it getting high?
High
Oh you cheeky face
Shirt open to the waist
Now it's really getting cold

One more paranoia, I don't want another
Oh yes I confess, I don't want another

Yes you handsome man
Wicked boy, you sycophant
Are you ready to feel?
Deep stress, nothing new
Anxiety to use
Coming through the door

One more paranoia, I don't want another
Oh yes I confess, I don't want another

Ah... Ah...
Taken many drugs, popped so many pills
Gasp at my adventures, marvel at my thrills
One more paranoia, I don't want another
Oh yes I confess, I don't want another
One more poison thought, don't want another
Yes, yes I confess, I don't want another

 

[Verse 1]
Love my superstitious games
Running circles round my brain
When I'm left smiling
I love to steal this living steam
My head in someone's dream
I'm tired of sleeping

[Chorus]
Call me crank, my idea
Crank, so severe
Crank, my conscience clear

[Verse 2]
I build my canopy of steel
It fulfills my sense of real
A chrome protection

[Chorus]
Call me crank, my idea
Crank, so severe
Crank, my conscience clear
It's clear

[Verse 3]
In this small partition, like a prison
Explode time bomb
If you know where I come from
Just call me

[Chorus]
You call me crank, my idea
Crank, so severe
Crank, my conscience clear
Please call me crank, it's what I need
Crank, my mind in sync
Crank, my dream complete

[Outro]
Lay down, lay down, lay down
