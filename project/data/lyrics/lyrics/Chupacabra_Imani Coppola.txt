[Verse 1]
I'm gonna drink my whiskey
I'm gonna have my man
I know you got nothing to say

I'm gonna have my man
Gonna steal their hearts
And save them for another day

Ain't gonna hang my hat
Ain't gonna take off my boots
Ain't nothing gonna stop me in my pursuit

My stage
Time to rehearse
Gonna see all the wonders of the universe

[Chorus]
Pack my bags and mount my horse
I'm gonna ride on into the next town
Spend all my money on absolutely nothing
Need no man to pay for anything

Ain't got no shame
Nobody knows my name
I'm gonna ride on into the next town
Pecos Bill couldn't hang for long
A female legend with a song

[Verse 2]
Such a beautiful day
Such a beautiful day
I think I'll wear my brand new negligee

I'll probably change my mind
It happens every time
Just speak to my ex-fiance

I'm gonna hunt the hunter
Gonna serve 'em well done
Nowhere to hide
Nowhere to run

Up goes the moon
Down comes the sun
Cook my dinner while I shine my gun

[Chorus]
Pack my bags and mount my horse
I'm gonna ride on into the next town
Spend all my money on absolutely nothing
Need no man to pay for anything

I'd give my life to be her
I'd give my life just to be her
I'd give my sight to see her
I'd give my sight just to see her

[Bridge]
So here's the way I'm gonna break it down
Speak my mind anytime
'Cause I got the master plan

Power in my soul
Strength from my hand
I'm going up north to claim my land

Won't settle by river
Might make me shiver
So look out and hide your fans
I'm a woman on fire
With huge desire
To be as good as any man

[Chorus]
Pack my bags and mount my horse
I'm gonna ride on into the next town
Spend all my money on absolutely nothing
Need no man to pay for anything
