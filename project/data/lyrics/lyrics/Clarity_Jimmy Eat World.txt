[Verse 1]
This time it's on my own
Minutes from somewhere else
Somewhere I made a wish
With Lucky Denver Mint

[Chorus]
You're not bigger than this, not better
Why can't you learn?
You're not bigger than this, not better
Why can't you learn?

[Verse 2]
Hurry, go on ahead
Good things won't let you wait
I'll catch up when we get home
At home I'll leave, a dollar under water keeps on dreaming for me

[Chorus]
You're not bigger than this, not better
Why can't you learn?
You're not bigger than this, not better
Why can't you learn?
You're not bigger than this, not better
Why can't you learn?
You're not bigger than this, not better
Why can't you learn?

[Bridge]
Why can't I learn?
Why can't I learn?
Learn, learn, learn
Learn, learn, learn

[Chorus]
You're not bigger than this, not better
Why can't you learn?
You're not bigger than this, not better
Why can't you learn?
You're not bigger than this, not better
Why can't you learn?
You're not bigger than this, not better
Why can't you learn?
