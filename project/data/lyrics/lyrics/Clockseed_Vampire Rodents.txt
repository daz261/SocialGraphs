The clockwork
Sawing its way through
So filthy
Anchors in my hips
So filthy

I always knew that word
The one you drag out of me
I always knew that word

Clean me away
Like clockwork

Always in your mind
Searing lips

It's clockwork
Sawing its way through

I always knew
That word gives me away
I always knew that word
Anchored in my hips
So filthy
Filthy
