Hey babe I'm mirrored in your eyes
Don't say you don't know why
Oh babe I'm mirrored in your eyes
I feel that it's love
It's love you can't denie

Remember times you touched my skin
I new I would be close
When I said I love you so
But then you run away - why?

Hey babe I'm mirrored in your eyes
Don't say you don't know why
Oh babe I'm mirrored in your eyes
I feel that it's love
It's love you can't denie

Hey babe I'm mirrored in your eyes
Don't say you wonder why
Hey babe I'm mirrored in your eyes
I know that it's love
(I know that it's love)
It's love you can't hide
(It's love you can't hide)
Oh babe don't be so shy
(Oh babe don't be so shy)
B'cause I'm mirrored in your eyes
