Fragile rare occasion
Out of chaos a creation
Binding into one form
Lucid drunkeness
Aiming truth and openess
Baby you are a joy
I want you free when you grow boy
Revive the old idea that we carry

Binding into one form
Lucid drunkeness
Aiming truth and openess
Baby you are a joy
Nothingless
Truth and openess
Nothingless
But truth and openess

Revive the old idea that we carry
