Insatiable lust for murder
Greedy for desire
No sorrow stops my inclination
An inner burning fire
The war within my pulsing brain
Keeps me separated
From those who never understand
Blind and desecrated

[Chorus]
Red eyes are watching you
Immaculated cruel
You earn what you desever
No chance for your rebirth
It's just a battleground
For dissapointed hounds
My scorn will be your fate
That's what hell can create

The laughter of the useless man
Seems to me like promises
I raped and loved with silent pleasure
Not just in fantasies
I know there's nothing I can do
To kill the beast of thunder
They fed me with their inspirations
Escort me to the abbatoir

[Chorus]
Red eyes are watching you
Immaculated cruel
You earn what you desever
No chance for your rebirth
It's just a battleground
For dissapointed hounds
My scorn will be your fate
That's what hell can create

Stripped of all my dignity
Thoughts of suicide
No conscience and no regret
Anger form the skies
The wall of silence starts to fall
I'm gonna go with pride
Piece by piece the truth reborn
Death to my delight

[Chorus]
Red eyes are watching you
Immaculated cruel
You earn what you desever
No chance for your rebirth
It's just a battleground
For dissapointed hounds
My scorn will be your fate
That's what hell can create
