[Verse 1]
I perish and nobody will know
As my mouth remains still
My heart awaits me, filled with gravel
As the pain grows with each touch

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Since I marked her out from my tower
Reality focused through forbidden lenses

[Chorus]
She owns enough of preciousness
A penalty given by the source

[Verse 2]
I perish and nobody will know
As my mouth remains still
My heart awaits me, filled with gravel
As the pain grows with each touch

[Pre-Chorus 2]
But I still have no choice
Though the hinderance frighten
A labyrinth closing at the edge of space

[Chorus]
She owns enough of preciousness
A penalty given by the source

[Post-Chorus]
But they never allow
She's shut... for all beings but one

[Bridge]
I give my scorn, my threat

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Since I marked her out from my tower
Reality focused through forbidden lenses

[Chorus]
She owns enough of preciousness
A penalty given by the source
