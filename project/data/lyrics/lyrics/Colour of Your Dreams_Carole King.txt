We met along the back streets where we would not be seen
Our bodies full of passion, with love our only dream
The neon flashed in our hotel room, but I never complained
Until the night you left me standing in the rain

I wondered what had happened, afraid to call your home
So I spent the night in the local bar, but I had to drink alone
I must have gotten in a fight, 'cause I woke up bleeding with pain
I had the midnight sun with you
Now I'm standing in the rain
Standing in the rain

Another woman answered when I called you in the morning
The sound of her voice came without a warning
The sun was coming up, but inside my soul was storming
I guess there are some promises you just can't keep

I'm still wandering down those back streets
But with a different point of view
'Cause I lost everything I had when I bet it all on you
I try not to think about it, or else I'll go insane
Sometimes I cry, wondering why you left me standing in the rain
Standing in the rain
Why did you leave me standing
Standing in the rain
