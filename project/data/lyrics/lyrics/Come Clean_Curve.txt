[Verse 1]
A distant stare I see myself there
Deep in the black
But can he see me of this I'm not sure
It's just a feeling

[Chorus]
And you know how those things
Have got me in trouble before
Yes you know how those things
Have got me in trouble before
I thought I saw something familiar
I thought I saw something

[Verse 2]
Walks my walk and speaks my language
All at the same time

[Chorus]
But he don't know the half of the hurt
That he left behind
No, he don't know the half of the hurt
That he left behind
I bet you saw something familiar
I bet you saw something familiar
I bet you saw something

[Bridge]
Should I say
Where you been all my life
Should I say
Where you been all my life
Should I say
Where you been all my life
Should I say, should I say
Should I say, should I say

[Chorus]
No, he don't know the half of the hurt
That he left behind
No, he don't know the half of the hurt
That he left behind
I thought I saw something familiar
I thought I saw something familiar
I thought I saw something familiar
I thought I saw something familiar
I thought I saw something
