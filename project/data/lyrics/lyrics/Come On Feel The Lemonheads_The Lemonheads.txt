I know a place where I can go
When I'm alone
Into your arms ooh oh ooh
Into your arms
I can go

I know a place that's safe and warm
From the crowd
Into your arms ooh oh ooh
Into your arms
I can go

And if I should fall (fall)
I know I won't be alone
Be alone anymore

I know a place where I can go
When I'm alone
Into your arms ooh oh ooh
Into your arms
I can go

I know a place that's safe and warm
From the crowd
Into your arms ooh oh ooh
Into your arms
I can go

So if I should fall (fall)
I know I won't be alone
Be alone anymore

I know a place where I can go
When I'm alone
Into your arms ooh oh ooh
Into your arms
I can go
I can go
