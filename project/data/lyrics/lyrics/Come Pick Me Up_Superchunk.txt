Walking up First in the sun
Avoiding everyone
When you come high into view
Over Bellevue
And those bricks begin to hum

Glass vibrates with the tone
You're nothing but alone
United nations glow with light
You're up all night
But this is no one's home

Sensing one way free
These canyons killing me
Well you dive then lift away
With the dying day
Falling from my feet

Hello hawk, come pick me up

When I saw your shadow
Blurry though it was
In the heat somehow I knew
It was you
Beating down the dusk

Grab us by the neck
I volunteer as prey
We could leaf the world in gold
If this muddy road
Would only wash away

Hello hawk, come pick me up
