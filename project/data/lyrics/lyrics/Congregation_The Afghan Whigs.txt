Untie the boat and turn on the water
I'm gone, i'm gone, i'm gone
It's alright
Untie the boat and turn on the water
I'm gone, i'm gone, i'm gone
It's alright
Carry me out deep into the ocean
Save me a prayer and let me over the side
Untie the boat and turn on the water
I'm gone, i'm gone, i'm gone
But it's alright
And you can hold me down
But don't you let me breathe
Let it wash all over me
Let it wash all over me
They cut off my head, child and gave it away
And poisoned the people i wanted to save
And left me here dark and rolling around
I'm gone, i'm gone, i'm gone
But it's alright
