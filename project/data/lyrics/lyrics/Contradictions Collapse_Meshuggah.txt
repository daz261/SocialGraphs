Swear

 

Your words such unessential lies
Refract my barred-up eyes
You all tell me I'm confined
In my "shell of hallucinations"
So try and make me realize
Break my secure enclosure
Just try and I know you'll make me laugh
To hell with your damn comprehension

You belabor me for past and present mishaps
As if I had the might of alteration
You've had your trips into my brain; I know you begrudge
Now let me leave for my amenity

So you see, you white-coated freak
I don't need your allegations
Instead, join me to sanity's end
With my sweet needle of salvation

Increasing needs
Of my only friend
The one I trust
He runs in my veins
Hides me away
Under his soothing crust

Madness reigns
You're no longer in charge of my alluring illusions
That takes me wherever i want, my
Malnutriated malice
Rises strong and makes me the ruler of
Earth, wind and fire
As reality fades, I'm a king on clouds
The self-pity no longer runs in my veins; I'm a
Malevolent revelation; please let me stay
Give me more

Left out, dragged down into emptiness
Drowning in floods of misunderstanding
Why do you all look aside?
You're ripping my dignity away
Inside, identity is leaking out
Realization is catching up on me
My needs bashes false immortality
Into my affected being... Chaos

Cravings of delight
Slowly eats my soul
Trapped within myself
Defraying my own lies
Bewalling my demise
Deep penury... Internally

I feel marred by errors, can't you see?
My desires are calling for me
The sovereign of abnegations

Swings his feelers for a new relation
Come, mesmerize my oppressive mind
Tear apart these vehement cravings
Give me something to live for, bring me back
From my purgatory of obsessions

Increasing needs
Of my only friend
The one I trust
He runs in my veins
Hides me away
Under his soothing crust

 

Redundant cruelty
Children are shoveled into enclosed solitude
In lack of value caused by minor defects
Each one an unsuitability
Outside the public's field of vision

Left to die on a bed of concrete
While the rich swallows ostentation
Distorted minds screaming for consolation
The vanity of convenience rules the world

Locked up
Who cares about rights?
So what
If the world's a bit rude?
The prosperous
Pay to keep it concealed
Leaving problems untouched because of fear

Abandoned lives, hundreds in a room
Staring with empty swollen eyes
Mutilated possibilities
Enslaved by insanity

The belligerent arrogance of the leaders
Strangles the subjected's right to a childhood of safety
Nightmares but for real forever engraved in the minds of lost infancies

Shut out from this dying world of calumny
Infanticide

A thousand souls a day flows away with the breeze

Living corpses, breathing lungs filled with disease
Underdeveloped twisted thoughts, trying to understand
Unfairly secluded by the prevailing injustices
That pushes this mentally ill world
Over the edge of acceptance

Locked up
Who cares about rights?
So what
If the world's a bit rude?
The prosperous
Pay to keep it concealed
Leaving problems untouched because of fear

Death inside, without reach their freedom
Bound to feel, within illness floating
Souls in penury, soon to fade out, aggravation in charge
Bemoan oppression, extensive carnage behind walls of uncertainty
We'll realise as the floods of insight come down
