They went down to the river
On a warm summer night
The air was thick with the
Smell of temptation
He said, "Why don't we lay in the river
Let the water run over me?"
And she grinned and she said
Now she said and she said
"Well, that's a good idea"

He held her head high in his hands
He held her down deep in the stream
He saw the bubbles and matted hair
Mixed in with the seaweed
She started to scream
Was it something I said?
Was it something I said?
And he said and he said
And he said and he said

"That's a good idea," he said he said
To be alone with you he said he said
I've been waiting for years
And I'd rather be dead

"That's a good idea," he said he said

He held her down in the river
He held her down in the water
Another river of mud
Wash away those tears
He said and he said
Now that's a good idea

I saw them from the ocean
She didn't seem to mind
Didn't fight it at all
She didn't fight it at all
Some things are best left alone
And sometimes I'm best left alone
And sometimes I see you in the water
At night at night at night

That's a good idea he said he said
I wanna feel you in the water
With your hands on my head
Push you down in the water
He said he said
That's a good idea he said he said
