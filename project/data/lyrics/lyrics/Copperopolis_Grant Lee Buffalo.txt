Maybe the rain's holding off
Surely it knows we're down here
Walking 'round barefoot lost
Pretty soon these clouds've got to clear

I know it's a lot
Arousing thunder I only ask you to stop
For a second so I could coax you to talk

Think when we first laid eyes
Didn't know who you were and then I was one more passerby
You were the girl in the entryway that's all that I knew but oh
You were still in school and I was insecure

I know it's a lot
Arousing thunder I only ask you to stop
For a second so I could coax you to talk

'Bout your dreams and
Orange soda
Tea leaves TV
More
More

Looks like the rain's holding off
Might as well take this slow
You know sometimes when I hold you in silence I listen real close
Then I hear you talking to my soul

Well I know it ain't half
Of this story I'm only meaning to ask
Just what would it take to coax you to laugh
To laugh
To laugh
To laugh

What would it what would it what would it take you to laugh
What would it what would it what would it take you to laugh

Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba
To laugh

La la la
