[Verse 1]
Release this fury
Malediction
Cursed existence
Writhing in this life of dissent

Pain for pleasure
Pain for adoration
Pain is to godliness
Bleeding for ecstasy

[Chorus]
Divine
Pain Divine

[Verse 2]
Locked in vicious
Offer to the sado-gods
Nails driven through my dreams
Bleeding - Pain is a god's reward

[Bridge]
Gliding through these dungeons
Heightened senses overwhelmed
Hedonistic rupture
Endurance makes one divine

[Chorus]
Divine
Pain Divine

[Verse 2]
Locked in vicious
Offer to the sado-gods
Nails driven through my dreams
Bleeding - Pain is a god's reward
