[Verse 1: Shawn Colvin, Mary Chapin Carpenter, Both]
One cool remove
Put me
One cool remove
Put me there
And forever let me stay
One cool remove away

[Verse 2: Mary Chapin Carpenter, Shawn Colvin, Both]
One cool remove
From the things that hurt me
One cool remove
From the sea and city
See it all in a passion play
One cool remove away

[Chorus: Shawn Colvin and Mary Chapin Carpenter]
One cool remove from the white sun
Rising like a cloud above the land
One cool remove from the red moon
Falling like a hand

[Verse 3: Shawn Colvin, Mary Chapin Carpenter, Both]
One cool remove
Like a Buddhist breathing
One cool remove
Since all is fleeting
I neither come nor go nor stay
One cool remove away

[Chorus: Shawn Colvin and Mary Chapin Carpenter]
One cool remove from the white sun
Rising like a cloud above the land
One cool remove from the red moon
Falling like a hand

[Verse 3: Shawn Colvin, Mary Chapin Carpenter, Both]
One cool remove
One cool remove
One cool remove
One cool remove
I neither come nor go nor stay
One cool remove away
One cool remove away
