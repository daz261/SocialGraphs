[Chorus]
I see the light
I see the light at the end of the tunnel
I see the light and it's burning bright
I see the light it's the light at the end that I run to
And the light, darling is you

[Verse 1]
In the lonely heart of darkness
I have stumbled and I have strayed
Always searching but never finding
A ray of sunlight to guide my way

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
I have travelled down this highway
Of hope abandoned and broken dreams
An unbeliever my faith was shaken
By all the sorrow I had seen

[Chorus]
