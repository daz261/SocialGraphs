[Verse 1]
Well, I got a little woman called Crazy Legs
She's the queen of the teenage crowd
All the cats stuck the nickels in the old jukebox
Just to watch you do the bop when the music gets loud

[Chorus]
Crazy Legs, Crazy Legs, bopping all over the floor
Do the bop, Crazy Legs do the bop
She's my baby and I don't mean maybe
She mine, mine, mine, all mine

[Verse 2]
Well, I'm crazy about Crazy Legs and Crazy Legs is crazy about me
Well, I'm crazy about Crazy Legs and Crazy Legs is crazy about me
Well, she's my baby and I don't mean maybe
She mine, mine, mine, all mine

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Oh, when she hears the music and she gets to her feet
Well, then she starts rocking with her crazy feet
She does a different kind of rhythm with every song
Well, that's why I call her Crazy Legs 'cause she's real gone

[Chorus]
Crazy Legs, Crazy Legs, bopping all over the floor
Do the bop, Crazy Legs, do the bop
She's my baby and I don't mean maybe
She mine, mine, mine, all mine
Jump, man, jump!

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 4]
Well, she can bop, she can boogie, she can move and jump
In a style that's all her own
Just give her lots of room and her rock 'n' roll tune
Baby, she'll do the bop till the cows come home

[Chorus]
Crazy Legs, Crazy Legs, bopping all over the floor
Do the bop, Crazy Legs do the bop
She's my baby and I don't mean maybe
She mine, mine, mine, all mine
Do the bop
