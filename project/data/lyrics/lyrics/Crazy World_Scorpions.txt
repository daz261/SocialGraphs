[Verse 1]
You can shoot me down, you can drag me round
Girl, I'll get you, it won't be long
You can smash my heart, you can trash our love
But my desire for you is much too strong

[Chorus]
To be with you in Heaven
I would go through the darkest Hell
In Heaven
There's no cure for love that kills

[Verse 2]
You can waste my time but you can't change my mind
I won't stop you, so just go on
You can play your games but it's all in vain
'Cause my desire for you is much too strong

[Chorus]
To be with you in Heaven
I would go through the darkest Hell
In Heaven
There's no cure for love that kills
To be with you in Heaven
I would go through the darkest Hell
In Heaven (Heaven)
There's no cure for love that kills

[Bridge]
Girl, I'm on fire, Heaven seems so close tonight
Girl, I would die for your love

[Verse 1]
You can shoot me down, you can drag me round
Girl, I'll get you, it won't be long
You can smash my heart, you can trash our love
But my desire for you is much too strong

[Chorus]
To be with you in Heaven
I would go through the darkest Hell
In Heaven
There's no cure for love that kills
To be with you in Heaven
I would go through the darkest Hell
In Heaven
There's no cure for love that kills
To be with you in Heaven
I would go through the darkest Hell
In Heaven (Heaven)
There's no cure for love that kills
To be with you in Heaven
I would go through the darkest Hell
In Heaven
There's no cure for love that kills
