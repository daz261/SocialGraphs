It's four o' clock
The TV's on
My mind is shut off and my own thoughts are gone
I change the channel
I change my mind
I change my life I want to leave it all behind
Cause I don't have a mind of my own
I am influenced by everything I see
And I can't help it now
Everything in my life just thinks for me

Can't help this habit I'm in love with my disease
Worshiping my idle time a life I cannot seize
Trapped by depression and I sleep all day
But Xanax, Valium, Ativan makes it all ok
It's so much more than a cry for attention
No loving hands can soothe this ache
So much more than a war with the world
It's my own degradation it's my own self hate
I preach my pessimism
Right out loud to anyone who'll listen
I'm not afraid to be alive
I'm afraid to be alone

Late at night my monsters find me
From under the bed or right out of my past
All alone with nobody to talk to
Sanity gets put to the test
I close my eyes but I'm still haunted
Sometimes I get too twisted to sleep
As all my world crumbles all around me
Inspirations become admissions of defeat

Cause I don't have a mind of my own
I don't have a mind of my own
I don't have a mind of my own
Everything in my life just thinks for me

 

One more fix just a little bit
Of that heaven I found crawling in the sun
Sitting, waiting, calling me
To indulge in this game that'll set me free

Another wasted night and here I am again
Promises remain just promises and I don't know why
A moment of weakness is a moment of clarity
I know what I want
Why fight the temptation when it's all you've got
When it's all I've ever known

So I give in to the old ways of the past to start this off
Once again I drown myself, delivering from all I gained
Lies to myself won't seem to justify the means
I've got no time to listen to your good advice
I'm doin just fine, down on my own down here

I know one day this dance will bring me to my knees
It's only a matter of time before I fall again but that's alright
It's the little things in life that always
Mean the most to me anyway
So what if I go with a little piece of heaven
To take the edge away

Just like the living dead I walk around this place
It's not too bad here it really clouds
Over piece of mind I never had
Call it escape from reality
I call it lookin at the world
With both eyes open wide to the truth

I wanna be found smilin when I die here
I wanna burn my eyes out on the sun
In heavens basement you're the one that killed me first
Another endless night goes down

One more fix just a little bit
Of that heaven I found crawlin in the sun
Sittin, waitin, callin me to indulge in this game
That'll set me free, a moment of weakness is all
I've got and it's all I've ever known
Another wasted night and here I am
