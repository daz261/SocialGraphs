Cain, firstborn son of Adam
You killed your brother Abel
Now you bear a mark of God in your eyes
Pain is (the) sign of your symbol
And you'll be borne down by (the) load
You will walk forever to live and let die

Life is eternal for Cain
Bright shine the crime from his mark
Some secret's known by his name
He taught man handle Gods spark

(Let the he)
Let the he-goat
Bear all the old crimes
Walk with him, to distant east
Bore from burnt Adam's blossom
To wasteland of Azazel

Ride your horse into the deset of set
And meet him, your master Azazel (4x)

 

Dark horizons come close to me
And magic will be my key
I will travel through the gate
To be the finder of my fate

Nox, the night and key
I will open your old mystery
Key of night, open up!

Deep abysses I sink into
And behind the light I go
My long journey never ends
But I will receive what I send

Nox, the night and key
I will open your old mystery
Key of night, open up!
Clavicula Nox
