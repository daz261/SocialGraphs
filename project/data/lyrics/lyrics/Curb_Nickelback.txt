[Verse 1]
And some say
Why you follow if somethings so long?
So I asked him
And he convinced me before long
Now it's over
And I've seen him, don't come back anymore
And he said

[Chorus]
I need
I don't ask much anymore
I found
I found something, yeah

[Verse 2]
Throw a stone into the water
The ripple is broke
Burn them, baby
Just for holding the candle too close
Take it all back
Search for justice, don't live there anymore
And he said

[Chorus]
I need
I don't ask much anymore
I found
I found something, yeah

[Verse 2]
And why do you see me in this way?
The way that I did
I gave him the means to the ends
Yes, I did
I bothered not to believe in this way
The way that I did
I made him just to see in this way
The way that I did
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus until Fade]
I need
I don't ask much anymore
I found
I found something, yeah

 

[Verse 1]
I asked you to stay
But you said there's no way
I begged you call
And you leave me after all
I know I'm not to blame
I know you don't feel the same
Didn't even tell me why
You just left me here to die

[Chorus]
I stand, I fall, I bounce off these four walls
You laugh, you leave
And you leave me here alone

[Verse 2]
I'm guilty too
I'm giving all to you
That's my worst sin
Sorry for giving in
Didn't mean to waste your time
Thanks for wasting mine
Could have to tried to let me be?
Would you just set me free?

[Chorus 2]
I stand, I fall, I bounce off these four walls
You laugh, you leave
And you leave me here alone
Is this how it's gonna be?
It's fine for you and not for me
Did you even care at all?
You stand, I fall

[Bridge]
Could I pay you not to?
Could I pay you not to?
Could I pay you not to?
Could I pay you not to?

[Verse 3]
I asked you to stay
But you said there's no way
I begged you to call
And you leave me after all
I know I'm not to blame
I know you don't feel the same
Didn't even tell me why
You just left me here to die

[Chorus]
I stand, I fall, I bounce off these four walls
You laugh, you leave
And you leave me here alone
Is this how it's gonna be?
It's fine for you and not for me
Did you even care at all?
You stand, I fall

[Outro]
Could I pay you not to? (Fall)
Could I pay you not to? (Fall)
Could I pay you not to? (Fall)
Could I pay you not to? (Fall)
Could I pay you not to? (Fall)
Could I pay you not to? (Fall)
Could I pay you not to? (Fall)
Could I pay you not to? (Fall)
