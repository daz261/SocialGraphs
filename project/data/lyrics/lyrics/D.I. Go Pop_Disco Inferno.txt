[Verse 1]
We'll skip through this world now
You're obsolete
Get picked up like a worm off the ground
Leave a trail that men can see
Chameleon skin
Is what you need to be in
When nothing's what it appears
What should you be?

It's going to be-

[Verse 2]
Our souls [?]
Through the void [?]
Cling to the walls like a gecko
Using your chameleon skin

It's going to be-

[Verse 3]
We move barefoot through the modern world
Where no one will see us coming
We take what we want and then leave
In our new chameleon skins
