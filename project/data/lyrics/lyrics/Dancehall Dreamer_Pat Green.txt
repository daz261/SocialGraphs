I found you in a Louisiana roadside park, beat up broke down no place left to turn, I took you back to Texas under a harvest moon, we found a little place to call our own, we shared all the hopes and dreams of our younger years, married at the tender age of twenty-one, rollin' down the highways, dirt roads and the byways, you liked to drive so I would go shotgun

Chorus

We'd go down to the river, where I could hold your body close to mine
We'd listen to the rhythm, of that old water rollin
You can stay with me until the morning light

Somewhere through the year somebody turned your head, and has taken my sweet love so far from me, yeah he swept you off to Boulder, where the air it gets much colder, than this southern boy would ever like to see, I think of calling you on lonely nights, when being alone gets the best of me, yeah but this here whiskey bottle, will take me to a place, where you and I will always be

Chorus

When you came back home everybody said I was a fool, 'cause I took you back without a word to say, But I couldn't go on living thinkin' about all I missin', and I don't give a damn about what those people say

Chorus

 

Well from Dalhart to Del Rio
And out El Paso way
I've been doin' fine on Houston time
When the sun sets on the Copano Bay
From way up where the Red River flows
On down to the Rio Grand
I was born a little native Texican
And i'm proud to say that I am

Chorus
Yeah well I like Texas
Ain't it fine here
I like to pick my guitar down at Luckenbach
And drink that Shiner Bock beer
Yeah well I like Texas
Man there ain't no doubt
Just listen to me cause I know what i'm talkin about

Well theres old dancehalls and little cafe's
Where you can get a taste of the Lone Star State
You can strap on boots and have yourself a laugh or two
Well theres no line dancing just straight romancing
That Hill Country love is what I fancy
Where the streams running clear and the skies they are so blue

Chorus
Yeah well I like Texas
Ain't it fine here
I like to pick my guitar down at Old Gruene Hall
And drink that Shiner Bock beer
Yeah well I like Texas
Man there ain't no doubt
Just listen to me cause I know what i'm talkin about

Well it's a two day old burrito
One lukewarm beer to go
On the Sunday side of a roadtrip weekend
Lordy I was feeling so low
When somebody flipped on the jukebox
And I heard ol Bob Wills say
"Stay all night, stay a little longer" so I held on another day

Chorus
Yeah well I like Texas
On a Saturday night
Just let me listen to ol Gary P. Nunn
And everything will be just right down here in Texas
Man there ain't no doubt
Just listen to me cause I know what i'm talkin' about

Yeah well I like Texas
Ain't it fine here
I like to pick my guitar down Stubbs Bar-B-Que
And drink that Shiner Bock beer
Yeah I like Texas
Man there ain't no doubt
Just listen to me cause I know what i'm talkin about


I said just listen to me cause I know what i'm talkin about
