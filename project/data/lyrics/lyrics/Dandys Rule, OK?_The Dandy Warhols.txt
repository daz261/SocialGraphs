You're my ride
And I'm out my window
And it's alright
If you got candy-o

You're so cool
And not much older
But you know how to drive
Baby, you're my ride

I slip outside
And to the corner
Roll down your drive
Before you start it

Well, I'm no fool
Not like your father
Awake outside
Baby, you're my ride

My ride
My ride
My ride
Baby, you're my ride
