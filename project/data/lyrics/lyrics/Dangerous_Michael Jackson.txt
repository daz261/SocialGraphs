[Intro]
There is something I have to say to you
If you promise you'll understand
I cannot contain myself when in your presence
I'm so humble
Touch me, don't hide our love
Woman to man

[Verse 1]
She's just a lover who's doing me by
It's worth the giving, it's worth the try
You cannot cleave it or put it in the furnace
You cannot wet it, you cannot burn it

[Chorus]
She wants to give it
She wants to give it
Oh, she wants to give it (Dare me)
She wants to give it
Oh, she wants to give it (She wants to give it)
She wants to give it (Yeah)
Oh, she wants to give it
She wants to give it
Oh, she wants to give it

[Verse 2]
It's just a feeling, you have to soothe it
You can't neglect it, you can't abuse it
It's just desire, you cannot waste it
Then, if you want it
Then, won't you taste it

[Chorus]
She wants to give it
She wants to give it
Oh, she wants to give it (Dare me)
She wants to give it
Oh, she wants to give it (She wanna get it)
She wants to give it (Yeah)
Oh, she wants to give it
She wants to give it
Oh, she wants to give it

[Post-Chorus]
One thing in life you must understand
The truth of lust to woman to man
So open the door and you will see
There are no secrets
Make your move, set me free
Oh, because there's something about you, baby
That makes me want to give it to you
I swear there's something about you, baby (Oh)
Just promise me whenever we say (And we get it)
Or whatever we do to each other
For now we will be making a vow (Never knew)
To just keep it in the closet

[Verse 3]
If you can get it, is it worth the try?
I really want it, I can't deny
It's just desire, I really love it
'Cause if it's aching, you have to rub it

[Chorus]
She wants to give it
She wants to give it
Oh, she wants to give it (Dare me)
She wants to give it
Oh, she wants to give it (Get it)
She wants to give it (Yeah)
Oh, she wants to give it (Dare me)
She wants to give it
Oh, she wants to give it

[Post-Chorus]
Just open the door and you will see
This passion burns inside of me
Don't say to me you'll never tell
Touch me there, make the move, cast the spell
Oh, because there's something about you, baby
That makes me want to give it to you
I swear there's something about you, baby
That makes me want
Just promise me whatever we say
Or do to each other (Whatever we do)
For now we'll make a vow
To just keep it in the closet
Because there's something about you, baby
That makes me want to give it to you
Because there's something about you, baby
That makes me want to give it to you
I swear there's something about you, baby
That makes me want to give it to you
I swear there's something about you, baby
That makes me want to give it to you
I swear there's something about you, baby
That makes me want to give it to you
There's something about you, baby
That makes me want
Just promise me whatever we say
Or whatever we do to each other (Whatever we do)
For now we'll make a vow
To just keep it in the closet

[Chorus]
She wants to give it (Dare me)
Keep it in the closet
She wants to give it (Dare me)
Keep it in the closet
She wants to give it
Oh, she wants to give it (Dare me)
She wants to give it
Oh, she wants to give it
She wants to give it
Oh, she wants to give it
She wants to give it
Oh, she wants to give it
She wants to give it
Dare me
She wants to give it
Oh, she wants to give it
She wants to give it (Keep it in the closet)
She wants to give it
She wants to give it (Keep it in the closet)
She wants to give it
Oh, she wants to give it (Dare me)
