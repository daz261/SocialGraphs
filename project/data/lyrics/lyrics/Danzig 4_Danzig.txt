You crawl across the floor
On your hands and knees
To seek revelation
Little whip

I pull you up
I grab your hair
I give you hope
Little whip

I give the black sun
To sear off your tongue
I gave you a life
Little whip

A come on, little whip
A come on, little whip
A come on, little whip
A come on, little whip, oh come

Yeah, oh
Yeah, yeah, oh

I pull you up
I grab your hair
I give you hope
Little whip

I give you the world
You beheld in a dream
I gave you a night cry
Little whip

Oh, oh
Right, oh
No, oh

Little whip
A come on, little whip
A come on, little whip
A come on, little whip

Little whip, a come on

You lick your wounds
And you come right back
I give you nothing
Little whip

I send the black sun
And eclipse your moon
I steal your hope
Little whip, a go

Oh
Oh, yeah, oh
Little whip, a come on
Yeah, oh
Yeah, oh
Yeah, oh
Little whip

 

Can't speak
Can't talk
Can't do anything they want

Can't hide
Or change your mind
Gonna live with all my soul inside

Can't speak
Can't talk
Can't stop for the reeling cause
Or love, I told 'em all about it
Can't talk, 'cause I'm already lost

Can't think
Can't cry
Keep thinking of a suicide
It's hard, I just can't forget it
Gonna fade 'cause I'm already dead

Can't think
Can't dream
Don't care if I live or die
Don't talk, I just can't believe it
Gonna fade 'cause I'm already dead

I can't think
I can't dream
Don't believe anything I see
Oh no, I don't want to get it
Gotta leave or I'll live to regret it

Can't speak
Can't lie
Can't go anywhere to hide
'Cause I can't think
I can't cry
I keep thinking of a suicide

Can't speak
Can't talk
Can't do anything I want
'Cause I can't hide
Or change your mind
Gonna live with all my soul inside

Can't speak
Can't talk
Can't do anything I want to
'Cause I can't hide
Or change your mind
Gonna live with all my soul inside, 'cause
