[Verse 1]
I'm the wolf
I'm the one you want
I'm the killer wolf
I'm 'onna pound you home
I'm the wolf
Howlin' all night
I curl up next to you
When you're all alone

[Pre-Chorus]
When I go inside your little girl, and I do
When I come inside your little...

[Chorus]
Just one kiss, yes
From my lips
Rake your soul
Over burning coals

[Verse 2]
I'm the wolf
Howlin' all night
I'm the king wolf
I put the chill in your bones
I'm the wolf
Hunting you down
I ain't no back door wolf
I don't scratch at no doors

[Pre-Chorus]
When I go inside your little girl, and I will
When I come inside your little girl

[Chorus]
Just one kiss, yes
From my lips
Rake your soul
Over burning coals
Just one touch
From my love
Make you howl
'Til the sun comes up
I'm the wolf

[Pre-Chorus]
When I go inside your little girl, and I will
When I come inside your little girl

[Chorus]
Just one kiss, yes
From my lips
Rake your soul
Over burning coals
Just one touch, yes
From my love
Make you howl
'Til the sun comes up
I'm the wolf

[Outro]
Howlin' all night
I'm your killer wolf
Whatever you want
I'm the wolf
Howlin' all night
I'm your wolf

 

[Verse 1]
Blackest of the black
Darker than night
Come to me my bleeding light
See she comes
She comes now
Enter oblivion
Yea, here she is
Harder than life
In my arms
See she there
Entwined with love
Unclean she is

[Pre-Chorus]
And she comes down to me, yeah
And she offers me sleep
Under her black

[Chorus]
Whoa-oh, under her black wings
Whoa-oh, under her black...

[Verse 2]
See she comes
On the eve of dusk
In another form
With a scent of rain upon her neck
She brings the lust
Supernatural
Ceasing never
On and on and on
Her stride is such
Mortals freeze
When she walks past

[Pre-Chorus]
And she comes down to me, yeah
And she offers me sleep
Under her black

[Chorus]
Whoa-oh, under her black wings
Whoa-oh, under her black wings
Whoa-oh, under her black wings
Whoa-oh, under her black wings

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
See she comes
Blacker than pitch
Have to make this fallen bitch
All I want
All I crave
Demoness calls
The bitch is come
For those who wait
Cross the breach in hell
See she is bedeviled with breasts
Enchantment on legs

[Pre-Chorus]
And she comes down to me, yeah
And she offers me sleep
Under her black

[Chorus]
(Whoa-oh under her black wings)
She's got me under wings
(Whoa-oh under her black wings)
She's got me under wings
(Whoa-oh under her black wings)
She's got me under her black wings, yeah
(Whoa-oh under her black wings)

She's got me under wings
(Whoa-oh under her black wings)
She's got me under wings
(Whoa-oh under her black wings)
She's got me under wings
(Whoa-oh under her black wings)
She's got me under wings
(Whoa-oh under her black wings)

[Outro]
Under her black!
