[Intro: Redman & Jeff Stewart]
Ah
You are now about to enter the psychotic mind of Redman
Let's take a journey on a funk cosmic adventure
To where no other nigga or bitch has ever entered
Let me lick your funky emotions with my cosmic lyrics
From a place we call Hell and beyond
And I say
Right about now, you are rocking with the best
Can I get a hit? (Hit it) Thank you (Hit it)
What you're about to experience is a walk on the Funkadelic side
Who knows better than the Funkadelic Devil himself?
To all knotty head niggas, bob to this
Come walk with Def Squad on the dark side
Coming to you live and direct, without further adieu
I bring to you Redman one more time
This is Jeff Stewart and you know how I do it
God damn (Word is bond, word is me)

[Bridge: Redman]
So who's that funky nigga that's known to kick the fat shit?
The mirror said, "You are, you conceited bastard"
Talking 'bout the dog, dogcatcher
It's the dogcatcher, I'll catch you
Oh, how insane
Catch a contact from the weed, it'll bust your brain

[Verse: Redman]
The top notch of hip-hop and I'm on the charts
I'm catching applause when I rock the microphone from the heart
My style's foul, so look into the Eyes of Laura Mars
As you can see, I drop funk bars from here to Mars
Still rollin' down the highway with my forty between my lap, bitch
Crossing the GW, coming into Manhattan
Boy, my skills are stacks, I love to do it from the back
My style swarms over ghettoes like crack
Go in any hood and puff a blunt with any nigga
As long as we both got, it don't matter who's gun bigger
But I bet you you can't do that
'Cause your multi-platinums can't save your ass from the block
And you're fucked if it ain't pop
The funk is blowin' wattage out your fuckin' trunks
Like Pete Puma, I'm known to give a ho lots of lumps (Ha-ha)
Props I got, coming through your block, nine cocked
My socks even got three-eighty-nine shots
Don't press it, I hang 'em like them niggas do in Texas
You don't have no heart, you chestless
'Cause your heart's on my necklace
I give props to real MC's like KRS-One
Kool G Rap, Buckshot, Busta B, and I'm from
The East Coast, where a nigga like you'd get laughed at
And since you came out gassed, well, I'm closing your gas cap
The creature from the deep, the ultimate funk freaker
Represent New Jersey, keep your eyes up on the Preacher (Uh)
A menace like Dennis, I got game like Guinness
I can French kiss my lyrics, then I run trains with sentences
Lord have mercy (Stop), it's too much funk to cope with
Droppin' dope shit after dope shit, we're the Trojans
Yell from the lungs
That rings from here to kingdom come
And I don't have to be a special ed to get dumb

[Outro: Redman]
So fuck what you heard, word to herb
'Cause I mac-a-frama-lama, plus I kick the grammar, straight from New Jers'
Badmon, here we, here we come
From New Jersey, in the place to be
So fuck what you heard, word to herb
'Cause I mac-a-frama-lama, plus I kick the grammar, straight from New Jers'
Because I can jam like Teddy if you let me
'Cause they here to stay
I'll be outside when you get there

 

[Intro]
Woo-woo-wowowowooo!
Lord hi-gher
Could somebody turn on da lights
Somebody turn on da lights
The darkside (Yessss...)

[Verse 1: Redman]
Guess who's back when I bring funk like Zapp
All aboard motherfuckers, qhile your brains get jacked
I'm souped like two scoops of funk juice, word to mother
The way I kick, you swore that Jim Kelly was in this motherfucker
The darkside brings apartheid
I act wild like them niggas from Chi-Town on the Southside
Sweeter than this, whoopin niggas down like Jack Nich
When I backflip my tactic graphics
Ooooooh! Redman jams it in
Due to difficulties I won't be done by ten
Friend I got bust shots out the twelve Benz
And then we get the bam-ba-zee from one-ten
Or is it further up? Plus my style murder ducks
So what the fuck, you got the mic turned up fo'?
When I Chief Rock underground MC's drop like sheet rock
Here's a ride to the underground

[Hook]
To the beat y'all...
Ah, to the beat y'all, I do the freak y'all
I keep the buddha to last me through the week y'all
Ah, to the beat y'all...
Ah, to the beat y'all, I do the freak y'all
I keep the buddha to last me through the week y'all

[Verse 2: Redman]
Come take a trip on my cosmic boogie movie flicks
Far beyond space so niggas say your grace
It's a True Lie that I bring drama like Schwarzeneggar
When a baby, I had other babies in labor catchin vapors
With two gats I move like too fast like Paxton
Ask Toni Braxton who got seven days of action
Black stars or moons eclipse the volume
Bang zoom I'm sendin honies on the moon with ten bags of boom
Ridiculously I will rip an MC
To degrees I leave spots like chicken pox, check the synopsis
I grow confusing just like Rubik's cube boxes
Float like the butter, fly so what if I
Blow your lenses, tear the fuckin hinges
Did I mention that my lyrical format gets more ahh's than a dentist
When I'm in this, the knotty-headed era causes terror
Y'all gimmick motherfuckers better get y'all shit together
One for the money and two for my peeps
Nynex can't even reach my technique or rap sheets
For the Squad I lick two shots word to God
Then take y'all dreams and imaginations
To the darkside
