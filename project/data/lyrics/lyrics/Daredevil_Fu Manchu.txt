Up on the blocks
Cause I've been hearin' it knock I said..
Over and over again

And in my hand
Got oil straight from the pan

Pullin' to the right.. be workin all night
I said, Over and over again

Feeling just fine
Five for a dime
Feeling just fine
Five for a dime (5 balls for a dime--in 70's pinball)

And there he goes.. yea only daredevil knows
Gotta wired to a higher sound
Way above the ground

'round the next turn I'm sure I'll burn
I'm lost and found

Feeling just fine
Five for a dime
Feeling just fine
Five for a dime

And there goes
A daredevil knows
And there goes
A daredevil knows
