I can still remember
Like it was yesterday
The pain inside my heart
As you turned to walk away

I don't know and I don't care
What the people say
I don't know and I don't care
I love you anyway

For I have found my love in you
And I have found a love so true

I can still remember
Like it was just the other day
I could have done without those stories
While you're so far away

I don't know, I don't care
What my friends all say
I don't know and I don't care
I love you anyway

For I have found my love in you
And I have found a love so true

Ooh, that first sweet night together
I will remember it forever
I put my heart on the line
Though I knew I was wrong
I would keep holding on

Do you still remember
All those times ago?
When you lay like a flame in my arms
And I could never let you go

For I have found my love in you
And I have found a love so true
Yes, I have found my love in you
And I have found a love so true

I don't know and I don't care
Ooh, that first sweet night together
I don't know, I don't care
I will remember it forever
