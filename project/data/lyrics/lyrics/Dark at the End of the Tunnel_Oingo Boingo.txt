[Verse 1]
When the lights go out
Everybody has fun, baby, baby, baby
When the lights go out
Everybody runs to a safe place
When the lights go out
Everybody's afraid
When the lights go out
Everybody starts to pray
Starts to pray

[Pre-Chorus]
Monsters and madmen
All come alive
When the dead start walking
There's no place to hide
There's no place to hide

[Chorus]
Hey, let's turn the night into day
Let's start a fire in an alleyway
Let's all go crazy by and by
And let's all pray to the cat's eye

[Verse 2]
No one can be trusted when the lights go out
People act real crazy; people start to shout
People huddle together; try and hide their fear
People party down, but they ain't going nowhere
They ain't going nowhere

[Pre-Chorus]
Gonna run outside
What's there to see?
Just one big shadow there to comfort me
There to comfort me, there to comfort me

[Chrous]
Hey, let's turn the night into day
Let's start a fire in an alleyway
Let's all go crazy by and by
And let's all pray to the cat's eye

[Verse 3]
Just common folks; like you and me
Turn into mobs that get so crazy
Prowl the streets like cats
Out for the hunt
Breaking all the windows, just because it's fun
Just because it's fun, just because it's fun

[Chorus]
Hey, let's turn the night into day
Let's start a fire in an alleyway
Let's all go crazy by and by
And let's all pray to the cat's eye
Hey, let's turn the night into day
Let's start a fire in an alleyway
Let's all go crazy by and by
And let's all pray to the cat's eye

 

This is someone else's story
Someone that I never knew
This is someone else's body
Am I getting through to you?

If you peel away the armor, is something underneath?
If you look below for hidden treasure
Underneath another layer
Are you hiding underneath the skin?

If you peel away the skin, is there anybody there?
If you peel away the skin, is there anybody there?
If you peel away the armor, is it too late to begin?
Is there anybody hiding if you peel away the skin?

Now a spark has passed between us, now
A momentary recognition
Something lost and something gained
And something shared that feels so strange
Something cold that will not go away

There's a heart as cold as ice
In a vault that's made of stone
Over years, the walls got higher
Over years, the walls have grown

Is there anybody in there in this self-inflicted tomb?
If you peel away the layers, is there someone in this room?
If you peel away the skin, if you peel away the skin

This is someone else's story
Someone that I never knew
This is someone else's body
Am I getting through to you?

 

On a cool dark night someone's coming down the street
With a smoking gun and a smile on his face
For all to see, the rest is history
But no one knows what's on his mind
Except him and his monkey--come on . . 

When the big man fell with a secret on his lips
So close, so close
'Til the bullet gave his kiss
The world cried out loud, the rest is history
And no one knows what's on his mind
Except him and his monkey--come on . . 

You've got a right to know
You've got a right to know
You've got a right to know
You've got a right to believe that there's something more to see

There's a man at the desk who is talking real soft
To a half dozen guys but not a word is lost
The men depart they all know what to do
With a rifle aiming through a clearing in a bush
So close, so close, but no one thinks to look

You've got a right to know
You've got a right to know
You've got a right to know
You've got a right to believe that there's something more to see
Than a big bunch of flowers in a cemetery
So why hold out, come on and give your testimony

On a phone connection on the other side of town
Sits a man with a pencil who doesn't make a sound
He nods his head, the rest is history
But no one knows what's on his mind
Except him and his monkey--come on, come on

When the big man fell with a secret on his lips
So close, so close
'Til the bullet gave his kiss

You've got a right to know
You've got a right to know
You've got a right to know
You've got a right to believe that there's something more to see
Than a big bunch of flowers in a cemetery
So why hold out, come on and give your testimony

On a cool dark night someone's coming down the street . .
