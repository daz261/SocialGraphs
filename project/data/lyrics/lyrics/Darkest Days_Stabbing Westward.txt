Back when you were my life
You gave me something that I could live for
Now, everything's changed
And you're gone
But I'm still here waiting

How can I hold on?
With nothing to hold on to?
Why should I hold on?
When there's nothing to hold on to

Sex made me feel alive
But now I'm so bored with mindless passion
Drugs were somewhere to hide
But they've left me feeling cold and empty

How can I hold on?
With nothing to hold on to?
Why should I hold on?
When there's nothing to hold on to

I thought you were my friend
That you were someone that I could turn to
Now I realize
That you were a friend when you needed something

How can I hold on?
With nothing to hold on to?
Why should I hold on?
When there's nothing to hold on to

How can I hold on?
With nothing to hold on to?
Why should I hold on?
When there's nothing to hold on to
