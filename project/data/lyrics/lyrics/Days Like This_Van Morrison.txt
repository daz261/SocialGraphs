Take it or leave it I've heard it been said
All this Spring fever's just way over my head
Stealing my moments, taking up all my time
It's playing Russian Roulette with my mind

It's none of my business baby just what's going on
I'm not going to wait till somebody throw me a bone
I'm way out on a limb now, and nothing seems to rhyme
It's playing Russian Roulette with my mind

I think that you've caught on, that you've been used and all
I'm going down New Orleans, I've got to see Dr. John
Got my mojo working everything will be fine
Stop playing Russian Roulette with my mind

It's not easy baby when everything starts getting out of control
Hang on your hat now, hang on to your soul
Don't worry baby, I wanna throw you the line
They're playing Russian Roulette with your mind

Too many hustlers, I've been here before
None of them really know just who that you are
Everything gets contracted and space gets confined
They're playing Russian Roulette with your mind

They're playing Russian Roulette
They're playing Russian Roulette
They're playing Russian Roulette with your mind

They're playing Russian Roulette
They're playing Russian Roulette
They're playing Russian Roulette with your mind

 

It's not high finance, it's called heart and soul
If it's rock and roll, got to go, go, go, go, go
Gonna keep moving on up to the higher ground
Gonna keep on moving on up, I got to stand my ground
Gonna keep on moving on up, I wanna stick around
Won't let the bastards grind me down
Won't let the bastards grind me down
Won't let the bastards grind me down

Call me raincheck in the afternoon
Call me raincheck, need a shot of rhythm and blues
Call me raincheck, on a golden autumn day
Call me raincheck, I won't fade away, I won't fade away
I don't fade away, I don't fade away, unless I want to

Can't take my love away, ah 'cause it's here to stay
If it fades away, come back another day
Gonna keep on moving on up to the higher ground
Gonna keep on moving on up, I wanna stick around
Gonna keep on moving on up, oh gonna stand my ground
Won't let the bastards grind me down
Won't let the bastards grind me down
Won't let the bastards grind me down

My name is raincheck in the afternoon
My name is raincheck, need a shot of rhythm and blues
My name is raincheck, on a golden autumn day
My name is raincheck, and I don't fade away, I don't fade away
I don't fade away, I don't fade away, unless I want to

Move it up, move it up, move it up, move it up
Move it up, move it up, move it up, move it up
Move it up, move it up, move it up, move it up, move it up
Grind me down, grind me down, grind me down

My name is raincheck in the afternoon
My name is raincheck, need a shot of rhythm and blues
My name is raincheck, on a golden autumn day
My name is raincheck, and I don't fade away, I don't fade away
I don't fade away, I don't fade away, unless I want to

Put on your dancing shoes, dance away your blues
When I'm feeling like this, I got nothing to lose
Wanna keep on moving on up to the higher ground
Wanna keep on moving on up and I'll stick around
Wanna keep on moving on up, got to stand my ground
Won't let the bastards grind me down
Won't let the bastards grind me down
Oh, won't let the bastards grind me down

My name is raincheck in the afternoon
My name is raincheck, need a shot of rhythm and blues
My name is raincheck, on a golden autumn day
My name is raincheck, and I don't fade away, I don't fade away
I don't fade away, I don't fade away, unless I choose
I choose, I choose, I choose

No, I don't fade away, I don't fade away, I don't fade away
Unless I choose, I choose, I choose
I choose, I choose, I choose
I choose, I choose, I choose
I choose, I choose, I choose
I choose, I choose, I choose
No, I won't fade away, I won't fade away, I don't fade away
Unless I want to
