God is the answer
God is the answer
God is the answer
God lies within

And you can't say
That I didn't learn from you
And you can't say
That I didn't learn from you
And you can't say
That I didn't learn from you
And you can't say
That I didn't learn from you

God is the answer
God is the answer
God is the answer
God lies within

And I will not
Have a good time
But leave me just the same
The statue marks the place here
Where Pushkin stook his claim

God is the answer
God is the answer
God is the answer
God lies within

And I guess that
She couldn't tell me
Because she found it
Very frightening
And though a lead slug
Would have felled me
Pushkin
Rides the lightning

 

Come a little dog
Come a little dog
And had a little dog
Come a little dog
Come a little dog
And had a little dog
Come a little dog

Come a little dog
Come a little dog
And had a little dog
Come a little dog
Come a little dog
And had a little dog
Killed a little cat, and I killed a little dog
Killed a little cat, and I killed a little dog
Come a little dog
Killed a little cat, and I killed a little dog
Woof-woof
Killed a little cat, and I killed a little dog
Woof-woof

Come a little dog
Come a little dog
And had a little dog
Come a little dog
Come a little dog
And had a little dog

Where did the little dog come from
The little dog came from you
Little black spot on its little brown head
Little dead dog, I love you

Come a little dog
Come a little dog
And love a little dog
Come a little dog
Come a little dog
And love a little dog
Come a little dog
