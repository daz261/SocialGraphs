[Verse 1]
Dreamed I was a fireman
I just smoked and watched you burn
Dreamed I was an astronaut
I shot you down like a juggernaut
Dreamed we were still going out
Had that one a few times now
Woke up to find we were not
It’s good to be awake

[Verse 2]
Dreamed I was a tidal wave
I ravaged your coast, there were no survivors
Dreamed I was your landlord
I showed your place when you had lovers
If I was a vampire
I wouldn’t suck your blood
Then I dreamed I was you
The sweetest dream I have had

[Chorus]
If you could hear
The dreams I’ve had, my dear
They would give you nightmares for a week
But you’re not here
And I can never sleep
Come home so I can be a creep

[Verse 3]
Dreamed I was a dream
Stole you away, away in your sleep
Saved you from a fire
Gun for hire
Introduced you to a vampire
Wave crashed on the beach
We rolled around in its foamy grasp
Kissing in the chaos of a kelpy sea
Seems I couldn’t save you from me

[Chorus]
If you could hear
The dreams I’ve had, my dear
They would give you nightmares for a week
But you’re not here
And I can never sleep
Come home so I can be a creep

[Bridge]
Maybe I’m obsessive to think like this
Probably not impressing you
With my cheap tricks
Honey, it’s depressing what
Depression does to some
I’ll play the part for hours but
I know you’ll never come

[Chorus]
If you could hear
The dreams I’ve had, my dear
They would give you nightmares for a week
But you’re not here
And I can never sleep
Come home so I can be a creep
