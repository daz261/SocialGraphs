Terror! Worldwide!
You can't run away you can't hide
I came to get you! Get down!
Respect! And you can't turn back now
Speed is what you need, is what you feel, is what you're livin' for!
Let's fucking riot!

Go!
And welcome to my paradise
There's no good reason to keep you alive
Die, die, die my darling!
Run! cause you can't hide
There's no escape from where you coming from
We're going to the top where we belong

Life is like a videogame with no chance to win

Into the death!

Into the death!
Go, go, go!

Into the death!
Go, go, go!
Into the death!
Go, go!

Maybe we sit down and talk about the revolution and stuff
But it doesn't work like that
You can't turn back now, there's no way back
You feel the power to destroy your enemy

Midijunkies
Gonna fuck you up!
Midijunkies
Gonna fuck you up!

Another life wasted, another soldier dead
This system's guilty, it's true but sad
Our life is what they control
Soon they gonna take our bodies and souls!

Into the death!
Into the death!
Into the death!
Into the death!

Into the death!
Go, go, go!
Into the death!
Go, go, go!
Into the death!
Go, go, go!

In England they didn't wanna play on the radio!
