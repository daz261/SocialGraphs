Back in time the punishment
Was burn all you witches burn
Some mothers burned, burned alive
Hear the children cry...

Children Crying... mothers dying...

Some would die the innocent
Some would die a whore
Some so scared the children fled
Confused by this world

Why... they don't want to
Burn... alive...

Caught in the burning times
When all the witches died
Still hear the children crying
The burning times...

Some say when you float a witch
You set free their soul
I've always said... burn the bitch
My spoken words of old
Why... they don't want to
Burn... alive

Caught in the burning times
When all the witches died
Still hear the children crying
The burning times...

Back in time the punishment
Was burn all you witches burn
Some paid the price of their crimes
Caught in the burning times

Why... they don't want to
Burn... alive...

Caught in the burning times
So many people died
Still hear the children crying
The burning times...

Caught in the burning times
Caught in the burning times
Caught in the burning times

 

I was born into a womb so insane
Over crowded as we share the same veins
You will not be...
More man than me...
I... will not be the other...
I am the one... the chosen son
Who devours and smothers

Violence is not the way...
What am I anyway...

Implantation as they ripped us apart
Joined together cause we share the same heart
You will not be...
More man than me...
You... will not be the other...
I am the one... the chosen son
Who devoured his brother...

Hurt... help... hell...
And now you will see... that we will be
Always... together as one
Always together as... one
Will not be half a man
We're joined together as... one

The dominant son, who was joined as one
Always wonders why
The unborn son, who lives inside his head
Can never die

Violence is not the way...
Damaging vows I take...
The one who was built of rage
Bow down before I
Prayed forgiveness
From the father above
Joined together
But not bonded by love
I will not be...
More man than he...
We... will not have each other...
I am the one... the burden son
Who devoured his brother...

Hurt... help... hell...
And now you will see... that we will be
Always... together as one
Always... together as one
Will not be half a man...
We're joined together as... one...
