Daddy's little soldier boy
Mama's little pride and joy
Both hands on her apron strings
"Don't you touch that dirty thing"

A warning signal from above
Inspection with a clean white glove
They say that opposites attract
Like right and wrong, black on black

Like pleasure and a little pain
The sacred and profane
Ice and fire counteract
Like black on black

The oldest story known to man
The willing sacrificial lamb
Behind the light a shadow falls
The code of silence shakes the walls

A whisper to a silent scream
The power is so frightening
They say that opposites attract
Like right and wrong, black on black

Like pleasure and a little pain
The sacred and profane
Ice and fire counteract just
Like black on black

A warning signal from above
Inspection with a clean white glove
They say that opposites attract
Like right and wrong, black on black

Some things seem so sacred
Like a loaded question
The power of suggestion
Like the face of danger
The kindness of a stranger
Like a Judas Kiss
Like pleasure and a little pain
Immaculate seduction
Absolute corruption
Ice and fire counteract
No turning back
Like black on black
Black on black
Black on black

Like pleasure and a little pain
The sacred and profane
Ice and fire counteract
Like black on black

Like pleasure and a little pain
The sacred and profane
Ice and fire counteract
Just like black on black
Black
A little pain
Just like black on black
Black
Black on black
Black on black
Black on black

 

Forgive me I can't stay here anymore
I'm leaving with the tide
This evening another breeze blew round my door
Stirred me up inside
I'm breaking out of this tired old spell
I played it out long and so well
Oh whoa

And the phoenix flies straight and high
Back to Avalon
Now I'm on my way back where I belong
Gonna go there with the sun
Back to Avalon

Where I'm going all my demons disappear
I'm leaving them behind
I'm traveling way up on the atmosphere
Cause I made up my mind
Gonna find my love, gonna find my life
Gonne look them so deep in the eye
Oh whoa

And the phoenix flies straight and high
Back to Avalon
Now I'm on my way back where I belong
Gonna go there with the sun
Back to Avalon
Nobody knows what's inside my head
Or down this road
Whoa whoa I know I'm going home
And the phoenix flies straight and high
Back to Avalon
Now I'm on my way back where I belong
Gonna go there with the sun
And the phoenix flies straight and high
Back to Avalon
Now I'm on my way back where I belong
Gonna go there with the sun
Back to Avalon
