Well I found my inspiration there
In silent whispers it just came to me so clear
Simple question of what was I doing there

[Chorus]
Hesitation
When I'm standing with my prey
Indecision
Of if I should blow him away

It's kind of strange
What happened from that moment on
What more can I say than reason he was gone
What they were asking was more than I could bear

Execution
What more can...can I say
The realization
Of blowing a brother away

Something in me was gone
Something in me was gone

[Chorus]
Hesitation
When I'm standing with my prey
Indecision
Of if I should blow him away

Simple question of what was I doing there
Execution
It was not a part of me
The realization
Of how things are going to be

In my commitment to staying away from guilt
I feel no emotion for those I have gone and killed
Heartless devotion to saving the rest of me...

I take my gun and I give it to my prey
I turn my back to him and start to walk away
All I want is for someone to stop me there

Don't want redemption
Don't want salvation........(REPEAT)

In my commitment to staying away from guilt
I feel no emotion for those I have gone and killed.....
Heartless devotion to saving the rest of me...
