Kids 'round here look just like sticks
Trade old licks with a beat up six
I just smile and catch the groove
Gothic girls all dressed in black
Serious as heart attacks
Takes a little bit of getting used to
The old man with the whiskey stains
Lost the night and forgot his name
His poor wife will sleepalone again
It ain't hard to understand
Why she's holdin' on to her own hand

It's Midnight in Chelsea
(Sha la la la, Sha la la)
Midnight in Chelsea
(Sha la la la, Sha la la)

No one's asking me for favors
No one's looking for a savior
They're too busy saving me

I seen a lonesome rainy drive
Seems the chauffer took a dive
Sold his secrets to the sun
Ahh, later in a magazine
I finally figured what it means
To be a saint but not a queen
Two lustful lovers catch a spark
Chased their shadows in the dark
Someone's gettin' off tonight
A big red bus is packed so tight
Disappears in a trail of light
Somewhere, someone's dreamin'
Baby it's alright

It's Midnight in Chelsea
(Sha la la la, Sha la la)
Midnight in Chelsea
(Sha la la la, Sha la la)

No one's pinnin' dreams on me
No one's asking me to bleed
I'm the man I wanna be
When Chelsea girls sing
Sha la la la, Sha la la la
Sha la la la, Sha la la la
Oh, oh

It's morning when I go to sleep
And here comes the distant dawn with church bell rings
Another day is comin' on
Baby's born an old man dies
The way young lovers kiss good-bye
I leave my soul and just move on
Wish that I was there to sing this song

La la la la, Sha la la
Sha la la la, Sha la la
It's Midnight in Chelsea
Sha la la la, Sha la la
Ahh Midnight in Chelsea

No one's askin' me for favors
No one's looking for a savior
They're too busy saving me

It's Midnight in Chelsea
Sha la la la, Sha la la
Yeah no one's pinnin' dreams on me
No one's askin' me to bleed
I'm the man I wanna be
The man I wanna be
The man I wanna be
Midnight in Chelsea...
