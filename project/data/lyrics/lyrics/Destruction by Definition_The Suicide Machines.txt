Breaking...myself
There's something about myself I can't control
Yet it happens time and time again when I'm trying to be
Well I smash it down and break it down when I'm trying to be
Well it's such a shame it's sad to say there's nothing to see there
I don't wanna talk about it 'cause you know I can't live without it
It's a stupid fucking shame...
And every time I think about it
I think I'm so lame

I break the glass, I break it down

What's your story, what's your sign
No, I can't agree
Well you know you'll never get it in this life for free
You can blow it down and break the glass
Break my heart in two
But you'd better be prepared it's such a shock
There's nothing there

Fill me up because I'm empty
Why couldn't I just have kept me
You know it really fucking sucks...
When I try to talk about it the words seem to get stuck

I break the glass, I break it down
Down!

I break the glass, I break it down

Pick it up...
