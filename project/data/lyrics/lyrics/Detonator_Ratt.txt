I'm knockin' at your door
And there's no answer
I hear the moans and groans
Of your nasty laughter
I'm kickin' in the door
As your breathin' gets faster
Your trail of clues
Is leadin' to disaster

Once I looked into your eyes
I thought they were true
Innocence can turn to lies
And now the finger points at you, baby

Shame Shame Shame
You should've known better
Than to cheat on me
Shame Shame Shame
Now it don't matter
So let me be
You've got your own self to blame
Now it's time to feel the pain
Of your twisted little game
It's such a cryin'
Shame Shame Shame
Shame Shame Shame

Did you do your poses in the mirror
Did you tell him
Baby, baby please
Did you twist his tongue
And bend his ear
Did you have him beggin', beggin'
On his knees

Once you looked into my eyes
And told me you were mine
Now I see your cheap disguise
And you're runnin' out of time, baby

Shame Shame Shame
You should've known better
Than to cheat on me
Shame Shame Shame
Now it don't matter
So let me be
You've got your own self to blame
Now it's time to feel the pain
Of your twisted little game
It's such a cryin'
Shame Shame Shame
Shame Shame Shame

There's no answer

Once you looked into my eyes
And told me you were mine
Now I see your cheap disguise
And now the finger points at you, baby
Now you don't know what to do, baby

Shame Shame Shame
You should've known better
Than to cheat on me
Shame Shame Shame
Now it don't matter
So let me be
Shame Shame Shame
You should've known better
Than to cheat on me
Shame Shame Shame
Now it don't matter
So let me be
You've got your own self to blame
Now it's time to feel the pain
Of your twisted little game
It's such a cryin'
Shame Shame Shame
Shame Shame

 

You say that you've got nothing to lose
You've got that hunger honey
You gotta feed it
Just open wide I'll take a bite outta you
'Cause I'm ready, are you ready
Love's like a bug that you catch in a snatch
I'm here to treat it baby
You know you need it
You gotta rash and now your hearts gotta scratch
Are you ready, yes I'm ready
You know what I'm tryin' to say
Let's put it this way
Scratch, scratch that itch
Scratch, scratch that itch...
I'll be the doctor and I'll give you the cure
For this infection
I'm your injection
I'll heal what ails ya honey
That's for sure
Are you ready, yes I'm ready
You know what I'm tryin' to say
Let's put it this way
Scratch, scratch that itch
Scratch, scratch that itch...
Any night or any day
I'll be there right away to
Scratch, scratch that itch
Scratch, scratch that itch
