[Verse 1]
You weren't born with the world falling at your feet
The path is long and agonizing
Being dragged on your knees
And the silver spoon in your mouth tastes spoilt with rust
When all that glitters isn't gold
And fortunes turn to dust

[Pre-Chorus 1]
You're prime for the raping

[Chorus]
And when you don't pander to meet the agenda
Scavengers start to gather
Perverse visionaries taste the lather
The just rewards in controlled rebellion

Tossed and probed like a gristly piece of meat
Lock, stock, and barrel slave
You just don't contradict big brother
He's got the right to push you under

[Verse 2]
And they pledge you the earth
Then pull you six feet down
And you're branded with the stigma
Unusable dropouts
And with inspiration ravaged
You take the final bow
The creative demeanor
Shattered into a million pieces

[Pre-Chorus 2]
You're ripe for the breaking

(Chorus)
And when you don't pander to meet the agenda
Scavengers start to gather
Perverse visionaries taste the lather
The just rewards in controlled rebellion

Tossed and probed like a gristly piece of meat
Lock, stock, and barrel slave
You just don't contradict big brother
He's got the right to push you under

[Outro]
Slave (slave)
Slave (slave)

Slave (slave)
Slave (slave)
