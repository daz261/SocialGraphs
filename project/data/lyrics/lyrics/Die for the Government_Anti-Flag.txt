You've gotta die, gotta die, gotta die for your government?
Die for your country? That's shit
You've gotta die, gotta die, gotta die for your government?
Die for your country? That's shit
There's a gulf war vet, dying a slow, cold death
And the government says, "We don't know the source of his sickness"
But don't believe what they say, because your government is lying
They've done it before and don't you know they'll do it again
A secret test, government built virus
Subject test group gulf battle field troops
You've gotta die, gotta die, gotta die for your government?
Die for your country? That's shit
You've gotta die, gotta die, gotta die for your government?
Die for your country? That's shit
First world war veterans slaughtered, by General Eisenhower
You give them your life, they give you a stab in the back
Radiation, agent orange, tested on us souls
Guinea pigs for western corporations
I never have, I never will
Pledge allegiance to their flag
You're getting used, you'll end up dead
You've gotta die, gotta die, gotta die for your government?
Die for your country? That's shit
You've gotta die, gotta die, gotta die for your government?
Die for your country? That's shit
I don't need you to tell me what to do
And I don't need you to tell me what to be, fuck you
I don't need you to tell me what to say
And I don't need you to tell me what to think! What to think
What to think, what to think, what to think, think, think, think
You've gotta die, gotta die, gotta die for your government?
Die for your country? That's shit

[Intro]
Gulp, gulp, gulp
Gulp, gulp, gulp
I want to drink more beer
Until I puke

Drink, drank, punk
Drink, drank, punk
Drink, drank, punk
Drink, drank, punk

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I'm so cool
I can drink so much
I can drink more than you

[Chorus]
Drink, drank, punk
Drink, drank, punk
Drink, drank, punk
Drink, drank, punk

[Verse 1]
Met a girl at the bar, oh
She was a 10 at 2:00, I gave her four stars, oh
I took her home, she spent the night, oh
At 10:00 am she was a fright

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Some old guy bought me some alcohol
We got drunk at the mall

[Chorus]
Drink, drank, punk
Drink, drank, punk
Drink, drank, punk
Drink, drank, punk

[Verse 2]
Mom's gonna get us at the mall, oh
In a drunken stupor, hope I don't fall, oh
I chew on a big wad of gum, oh
Mom won't notice, she's old and dumb

[Outro]
Drink, drank, punk
Drink, drank, punk
Drink, drank, punk
Drink
Drank
Punk
