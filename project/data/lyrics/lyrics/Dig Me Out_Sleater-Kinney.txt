[Verse 1]
In one more hour, I will be gone
In one more hour, I'll leave this room
The dress you wore, the pretty shoes
Are things I left behind for you

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, you've got the darkest eyes
Oh, you've got the darkest eyes

[Chorus 1]
I needed it (I know, I know, I know)
Oh, I needed it (It's so hard for you to let it go)
I needed it (I know, I know, I know)
Oh, I needed it (You never wanted to let it let it go)

[Verse 2]
If you could talk, what would you say?
'Fore you things were just night and day
Take off the dress, take off the face
I'll hold you close before I leave

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, you've got the darkest eyes
Oh, you've got the darkest eyes

[Chorus 2]
I needed it (I know, I know, I know)
Oh, I needed it (It's so hard for you to let it go)
I needed it (I know, I know, I know)
Oh, I needed it (It's so hard for you to let it go)
I needed it (I know, I know, I know)
I needed it (It's so hard for you to say goodbye)
I needed it (I know, I know, I know)
I needed it (You need a little bit, just a little more time)

[Bridge]
Don't say another word
About the other girl
Don't say another word
About the other girl

[Outro]
I needed it (I know, I know, I know)
Oh, I needed it (It's so hard for you to let it go)
I needed it (I know, I know, I know)
Oh, I needed it (Never wanted to let it, let it go)
