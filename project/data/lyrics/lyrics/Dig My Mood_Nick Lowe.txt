Raindrops are falling on the citys
Glitter heart
Everywhere
There are lovers
Like we once used to be
Each turn I take reminds me of how we're now apart
And I'm lost in a Lonesome Reverie

Over there is where we found that little park
On the day you decided
To say that you loved me
I mean to drive on by
But as I'm parking up
I get into a Lonesome Reverie

I don't want to live this way
Clinging on to yesterday
And a memory of what once used to be
So I turn for home torn reluctantly
From a Lonesome Reverie

[instrumental]

I dont want to live this way
Clinging on to yesterday
And a memory of what once used to be
So I turn for home torn reluctantly
From a Lonesome Reverie

I am lost in a Lonesome Reverie
