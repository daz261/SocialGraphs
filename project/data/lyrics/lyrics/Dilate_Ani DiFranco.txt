[Verse 1]
Sleepwalking through the all-night drug store
Baptized in fluorescent light
I found religion in the greeting card aisle
And now I know Hallmark was right
And every pop song on the radio
Is suddenly speaking to me
Yeah, art may imitate life
But life imitates TV
'Cause, 'cause you've been gone exactly two weeks
Two weeks and three days
And let's just say that things look different now
Different in so many ways

[Chorus]
'Cause I used to be a superhero
No one could touch me
Yeah, not even myself, and
You were like a phone booth
That I somehow stumbled into, and
Now look at me
I am just like everybody else
I am just like everybody else

[Verse 2]
If I was dressed in my best defenses
Would you agree to meet me for coffee?
If I did my tricks with smoke and mirrors
Would you still know which one was me?
If I was naked and screaming on your front lawn
Would you turn on the light and come down?
Screaming, "There's the asshole who did this to me
Stripped me of my power
Stripped me down"

[Chorus]
'Cause I used to be a superhero
No one could hurt me
Yeah, not even myself, and
You were like a phone booth
That I somehow stumbled into, and
Now look at me
I am just like everybody else
I am just like everybody else

[Bridge]
Yeah, you've been gone exactly two weeks
Two weeks and three days
But now I'm a different person
Different in so many ways
Tell me, what did you like about me?
And don't say my strength and daring
'Cause now I think I'm at your mercy
And it's my first time for this kind of thing

[Chorus]
'Cause I used to be a superhero
I would swoop down and, and save me from myself, and
You were like a phone booth
That I somehow stumbled into, and
Now look at me
I am just like everybody else
I am just like everybody else
