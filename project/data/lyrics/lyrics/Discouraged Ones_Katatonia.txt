[Verse 1]
Somehow better without this
Headlights fuck the city
Somewhere I'm broken
No sensations nevermore

[Chorus]
Somehow I never leave this deadhouse
Somehow I don't mind being gone
And if you really think you've seen me
I have to prove you that you're wrong

[Verse 2]
What do you say when you speak?
I sense no time
Discouraged television sleep
Not awake until it's dark

[Chorus]
Somehow I never leave this deadhouse
Somehow I don't mind being gone
And if you really think you've seen me
I have to prove you that you're wrong

[Chorus]
Somehow I never leave this deadhouse
Somehow I don't mind being gone
And if you really think you've seen me
I have to prove you that you're wrong
