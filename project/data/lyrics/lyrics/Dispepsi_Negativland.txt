When 7-Up has got me down
When Hi-C gets me low
My Labatt's Blue ain't blue, it's brown
My Nestl√©'s Quik just makes me slow
When my sparkling cider's lost its shine
My can of Sharp's is dull
Hawaiian Punch has knocked me cold
A feeling hits my skull

And my mind just turns to Pepsi
And I couldn't tell you why
Smart drinks lead me to forget
And Coke won't get me high
When Constant Comment won't shut up
I'll sit right down and fill my cup
With Pepsi
Drink it up

When Diet Rite to me is wrong
My Country Time's expired
My Minute Maid's an hour long
My Maxwell House won't get me wired
When my PET Milk turns on me
And my Five Alive is dead
When my Royal Crown's been overthrown
An impulse hits my head

And my mind just turns to Pepsi
And I think of it a lot
My Swiss Miss just wasn't pure
And Kool-Aid isn't hot
When Odwalla smoothies rough me up
I'll turn to a bigger cup of Pepsi
Drink it up

When Samuel Adams makes me ail
Dr. Pepper's not around
When Sweet Success has let me fail
I crave a flavor most profound

And my mind just turns to Pepsi
When I look, I see, I buy
My Crystal Light has just burned out
And Canada's gone Dry
My Yoo-Hoo will not call to me
I am a loyal endorsee of Pepsi
Drink it up

It's just a funny thing
(Drink it up, drink it up, drink it up, drink it up...)
It's just a funny thing, that Pepsi commercial where there's the sun setting on this barn, but you hear this sort of "reezh rzzh," "reezh rzzh," and you don't know what it is, then you see in the back of the barn there's a, a soda machine, and this guy has a dollar bill, going "reezh rzzh," "reezh rzzh," and then it takes it
(Yes!)
There's, "yes! yes!"

Everybody drink it up
