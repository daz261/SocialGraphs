(Bainbridge)
[Instrumental]

 

So you're alive, I thought you was done ...

So you're alive, I thought you was done
I'm gonna bring you down with my needle gun
Feel my pin-prick tattoo your spine
Give it a minute, your life's entwined with mine

It's gonna make you run
Needle needle, needle needle gun
It's gonna make you run
Needle needle, needle needle gun

Hear my laughter in your head
It's a pity, it's a shame nothing's been said
It's a vaccination joy with the ultimate death toy
It's gonna make you run, needle gun! needle gun!

It's gonna make you run
Needle needle, needle needle gun
It's gonna make you run
Needle needle, needle needle gun

It's gonna make you run
Needle needle, needle needle gun
It's gonna make you run
Evil needle, needle needle gun!

(Needle gun!)
