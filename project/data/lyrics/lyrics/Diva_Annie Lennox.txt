Precious little angel
Take a look at what you've done
Well I thought my time was over
But it's only just begun
Precious little angel
You're my own sweet turtle dove
Won't you stay with us for ever
In a bundle full of love

Well I was lost until you came

Precious little angel
Won't you spread your light on me
I was locked up in the darkness
Now you've come to set me free
I was covered up with sadness
I was drowned in my own tears
I've been cynical and twisted
I've been bitter all these years

I was lost until you came
I was lost until you came

And wouldn't I run a thousand miles
To be with you (to be with you)
And wouldn't I run a thousand miles
To be with you (to be with you)

Precious little angel
Tell me how can it be true
That such a gift from heaven
Has been sent for me and you
Precious little angel
Don't you worry don't you cry
When this bad old world has crumbled
I'll be standing at your side

I was lost until you came
