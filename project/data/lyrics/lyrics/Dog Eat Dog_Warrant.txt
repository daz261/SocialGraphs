Through the hole in my wall, I see into your head
A beggar's-day banquet on a four-poster bed
It's food for the eyes, it's drink for the soul
The hole in my wall, I can't let myself go

I'm spinning round and round
(Round and round and round)
Don't let me down

(Ooh, I groove)
Through the hole in my wall
(Love the view)
Through the hole in my wall
(Velvet blue)
Through the hole in my wall
(I see you)
Through the hole in my wall

The hole in my wall lets in the sound
Of bodies and sweat and merry-go-rounds
The hole in my wall is better than sex
An X-rated Disneyland, groovin' T-Rex

I'm spinning round and round
(Round and round and round)
Don't let me down

(Ooh, I groove)
Through the hole in my wall
(Love the view)
Through the hole in my wall, yeah
(Velvet blue)
Through the hole in my wall
(I see you)
Through the hole in my wall

[?]

Oh, I'm spinning round and round and round
(Round and round and round)
Don't let me down

(Ooh, I groove)
Through the hole in my wall
(Love the view)
Through the hole in my wall
(Velvet blue)
Through the hole in my wall
(I see you)
Through the hole in my wall

Through the hole in my wall
