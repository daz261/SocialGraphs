Driving riding keep the throttle open wide
Pounding hounding feel the beating deep inside
Flag goes up you get down
Beat the lights hear the sound
Turbo charge let it flow
Hold on tight and don't let go

Burning wheels of fire (*)
Racing to the wire
Bring the glory down on you

Burning turning screaming down the quarter mile
Racing chasing put the pressure on the dial
Nitro burn keep it clean
Down the straight like a dream
In your machine speed machine

(Repeat *)

Grinding winding drop the clutch and let her fly
Speeding leading feel the seconds ticking by
Beat the clock take your turn
Feel the heat start the burn
Hit the gas hear the roar
Kick the pedal to the floor

(Repeat *)
