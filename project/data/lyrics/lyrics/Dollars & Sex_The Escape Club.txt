I just left Hollywood, California
Our countries have become sewers
Not only Hollywood
There's San Francisco and New York and other cities
But by and large Hollywood
That has filled the land and filled the world with filth

I woke up this mornin'
I couldn't get out of bed
Felt like this heavy band were playin' in my head
They were screamin' through the ceiling
Screamin' through the walls
Stealin' all my photographs and laughing at them all

Well, I phoned the man at work and this is what I said
I woke up this mornin' but I couldn't get out of bed
And I said

Oh-oh, oh-oh
"You call it poison, but I call it rock and roll"
I said
Oh-oh, oh-oh
"You call it poison, but I call it rock and roll"

The change of style felt out of place
Got myself a suntan and a facelift for my face
Down to the cathouse, cruisin' in L.A
Found myself a pretty girl with nothin' much to say

Her conversation's like she comes from outer space
Got legs and long hair but I couldn't see her face
And she said

Oh-oh, oh-oh
"You call it poison, but I call it rock and roll"
She said
Oh-oh, oh-oh
"You call it poison, but I call it rock and roll"
Kick it

This one called the rebel rocker sound
Right
I sing about guitars, I sing a rocker song
We take a little walk in the New York town
Everybody round, livin' can't be stopped
Them heavy metal sound almost makin' me frown, ay
[?] irie
[?], gonna make you [?]
Went to the west to check out the best
All them rocky girls with the silicon chests
I say to you, mon, don't let them take your music away
'Cause you might play what you wanna play
And you might say what you wanna say
'Cause I must say
Bum-a-billy, bum-a-billy, bum-a-billy, bum
Bum-a-biddly, bum-a-biddly, bum-a-biddly, bum
Bum-a-billy, bum-a-billy, bum-a-billy, bum
Bum-a-billy, bum-a-billy, bum-a-billy, bum

It takes an hour backcombing my hair
Chilling out on heavy grass and picking clothes to wear
Look in the mirror, walk out on the street
Bump into a policeman I didn't expect to meet
He said to me, "Hey, are you some kind of red?
Well, it looks to me, son, like you just got out of bed"
And I said

Oh-oh, oh-oh
"You call it poison, but I call it rock and roll"
I said
Oh-oh, oh-oh
"You call it poison, but I call it rock and roll"

Bum-a-billy, bum-a-billy, bum-a-billy, bum
Bum-a-billy, bum-a-billy, bum-a-billy, bum
Bum-a-billy, bum-a-billy, bum-a-billy, bum
Bum-a-billy, bum-a-billy, bum-a-billy, bum

Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh

 

Are they expensive in Paris? I found it
(Yeah) Yeah, la vie a cher
Hey, hey, hey
It all depends which type of clothes you wear
Hey, hey, hey
Jean Paul Gaultier, Jean Paul Gaultier
Hey, hey, hey

See the girl in the cat black dress
She likes a man if he's had success
She likes to party, she likes to tease
But without money, she's not easy to please
She's got looks, she's got style
She's a gold card Gaultier Francophile
You got the money, you eat 'til you're full
But she can't love, she's so fashionable

Hey, hey, hey
You're so fashionable
Hey, hey, hey
You're so fashionable

She holidays in Mexico
To a place where the in crowd go
She says the poor are something to see
Cheri, I'd never let them come near me
She's got cheekbones, she's got legs
She got a million dollar beautiful empty head
(A million dollar beautiful empty head)
Ain't got no time to be animal
She can't love, she's so fashionable

Hey, hey, hey
You're so fashionable
Hey, hey, hey
You're so fashionable

Mmm, baby
Well, you drive me wild
(He's smart)
(He's a cutie)
Hey, hey, yeah
(Jean Paul Gaultier)
(Jean Paul Gaul-, Jean Paul Gaultier)

Just pull the string and hear her talk
She got a slicked-back catwalk walk
And that's all, nothing to say
She lights a cigarette and turns the other way
She's so slick, she's so cool
Her understanding of reality is minimal (No, no, no)
(Minimal)
Look in her eyes, there's nothing at all
She can't love, she's so fashionable

Hey, hey, hey
You're so fashionable
Hey, hey, hey
You're so fashionable
Hey, hey, hey
(A million dollar beautiful empty head)
Hey, hey, hey
(A million dollar, million, million)
(Million dollar beautiful empty head)
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, yeah (Hey, hey, hey)
(A million dollar, million, million)
(Million dollar)

 

(Shout)

(Oh) Hey, everybody take a vote for freedom
(Oh) And shout the walls down
(Oh, shout) Everybody all around the world
(Oh) Gonna shout the walls down

Man who lived and cried alone
Built these walls from brick and stone
Said, "Hey, baby, I need someone
To help me hide from my life"
They found him lying in her bed
Tears had stained the pillows red
Wanted to be free instead
But couldn't get away

(Oh) Everybody take a little bit of love now
(Oh) And shout the walls down
(Oh, shout) Everybody all around the world
(Oh) Gonna shout the walls down

Hey, everybody gotta hear you shout
(Shout the walls down to the ground)
So open your hearts and let it out now
(Shout the walls down, shout the walls down)
Oh, give me, give me your freedom song
(Shout the walls down to the ground)
Don't stop 'til you reach someone
Shout the walls down, ooh yeah

(Oh, shout) Everybody take a vote for freedom
(Oh) And shout the walls down
(Oh, shout) Everybody all around the world
(Oh) Gonna shout the walls down, let's go

(Shout)
(Oh)
(Oh)

(Shout)
(Oh)
(Oh)
(Shout)

She believed in something more
Wanted to live just a little bit longer
Then he walked right through the door
And carried her away
He built these walls from brick and stone
Called these prison walls a home
Ain't it funny how you can fall so low
But never fly away?
Fly away, yeah

(Oh, shout) Everybody take a little bit of love now
(Oh) And shout the walls down
(Oh, shout) Everybody all around the world
(Oh) Gonna shout the walls down (Shout)

Everything was gonna be alright
Full days and lovers' nights
And now she's lying back on the floor (Shout)
Wishing for something more
(Oh) And seven years, they don't mean a thing
Yeah, well, a diamond ring
She closed her eyes and he's someone new
And she knows he's dreaming too (Shout)

Hey, modern man, hey, watch TV
Every night and she wants to scream
(Oh) I'm wasting my life away
Too scared to run away
(Oh) Too old to fight, too tired to try
Oh Lord, I don't know why
But one day, I'm gonna turn around
And shout the walls down

(Oh, shout) Everybody take a vote for freedom
(Oh) And shout the walls down
(Oh, shout) Everybody all around the world
(Oh) Gonna shout the walls down (Shout)
