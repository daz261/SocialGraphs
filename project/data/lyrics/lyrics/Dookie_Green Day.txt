[Verse 1]
Takin' all you down with me
Explosives duct taped to my spine
Nothing's gonna change my mind
I won't listen to anyone's last words
There's nothing left for you to say
Soon you'll be dead anyway

[Chorus]
Well, no one here is getting out alive
This time I've really lost my mind and I don't care
So close your eyes and kiss yourself goodbye
And think about the times we've spent and what they've meant

[Refrain]
To me it's nothin'
To me it's nothin'
To me it's nothin'
To me it's nothin'

[Verse 2]
I'm losin' all my happiness
The happiness you pinned on me
A loneliness still comforts me
My anger dwells inside of me
I'm taking it all out on you
And all the shit you put me through

[Chorus]
Well, no one here is getting out alive
This time I've really lost my mind and I don't care
So close your eyes and kiss yourself goodbye
And think about the times we've spent and what they've meant

[Refrain]
To me it's nothin'
To me it's nothin'
To me it's nothin'
To me it's nothin'

[Bridge]
Do you ever think back to another time?
Does it bring you so down that you thought you lost your mind?
Do you ever want to lead a long trail of destruction
And mow down any bullshit that confronts you?
Do you ever build up all the small things in your head
To make one problem that adds up to nothin'?

[Refrain]
To me it's nothin'
To me it's nothin'
To me it's nothin'

 

[Verse 1]
I don't know you, but I think I hate you
You're the reason for my misery
Strange how you've become my biggest enemy
And I've never even seen your face

[Chorus]
Well maybe it's just jealousy
Mixing up with a violent mind
A circumstance that doesn't make much sense
Or maybe I'm just dumb

[Verse 2]
You're the cloud hanging out over my head
And hail comes crashing down, welting my face
Magic man, egocentric plastic man
Yet you still got one over on me

[Chorus]
Well maybe it's just jealousy
Mixing up with a violent mind
A circumstance that doesn't make much sense
Or maybe I'm just dumb
I'm a chump!
