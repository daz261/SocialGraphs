Saw your face last night on the tube
Strong fine snake in a sucker's vacuum
15 clicks and it's time to say bye
15 trips and a love that won't die

Me and myself killed a world today
Me and myself got a world to save
Broadcast dead revolution don't pay
Strapped up freaks on the Lazarus plane

I can tell just by the climate, and I can tell just by the style
I was born and raised on Venus and I may be here a while
Cause every supersonic jerkoff who plugs into the game
Is just like every subatomic genius who just invented pain

I will deny you
I will deny you baby
I will deny you
I will deny you baby
I will deny you
I will deny you baby
I will deny you
I will deny you baby
Yeah yeah, yeah, wow

Oh baby, I'm lazy
Oh baby, introduce me to God
Oh baby, I'm lazy
Oh baby, set a place for the dog, for the dog

Yeah, Oh

Shut me off cause I go crazy with this planet in my hands
Shut me off cause I go crazy with this planet in my hands
Shut me off cause I go crazy with this planet in my hands
Shut me off cause I go crazy with this planet in my hands

I can tell just by the climate, and I can tell just by the style
I was born and raised on Venus and I may be here a while
Cause every supersonic jerkoff who plugs into the game
Is just like every subatomic genius who just invented pain

I will deny you
I will deny you baby
I will deny you
I will deny you baby
I will deny you
I will deny you baby
I will deny you
I will deny you baby

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, wow
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
