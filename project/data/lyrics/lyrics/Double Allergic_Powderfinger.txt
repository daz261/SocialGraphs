If I had no friends, I'd have no one to ridicule
So goes the tale of the resident fool
If I clear my space, I could clear it to be with you
Backhanded claims of a resolute
If I call an end to the trouble, I'm sinking in
Maybe a sign for a crime or sin

I'll love my girl when she comes home
I'll love my boys when they get home
With friends like that, who needs enemies?

If I make no sense, I'll be nearer to fitting in
Spreading the wisdom by accident
If I call you out, that'll bring it all to an end
Token resolve of a dissident
When you pull me in, that'll settle the residue
Maybe a sign for a crime or a sin

I'll love my girl when she comes home
I'll love my boys when they get home
With friends like that, who needs enemies?

 

[Verse 1]
When you are set to throw in your hand
When you are far from home
When what you believe is buried in your hands
When you feel outgrown

[Chorus]
I'll be the one to pick you up again
When you decide you've had enough of it
I'll be the one
I'll be the one

[Verse 2]
When your speech is slow
When your eyes are closed
When you feel betrayed
When your heart is frayed
When your feet are cold
When your sights are low

[Chorus]
I'll be the one to pick you up again
When you decide you've had enough of it
I'll be the one
I'll be the one

[Post-Chorus]
I'll be the one
I'll be the one
I'll be the one

[Verse 3]
When you are set to throw in your hand
When you are far from home
When what you believe is buried in your hands
When you feel outgrown

[Chorus]
I'll be the one to pick you up again
When you decide you've had enough of it
I'll be the one
I'll be the one

[Post-Chorus]
I'll be the one
I'll be the one
I'll be the one
I'll be the one

[Outro]
When you decide you've had enough
When you decide you've had enough
When you are set to throw in your hand
When you've had enough
When you're set to throw in your hand
When you're set to throw in your hand
When you're set to throw in your hand
