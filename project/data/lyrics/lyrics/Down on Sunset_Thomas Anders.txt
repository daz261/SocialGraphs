[Songtext zu „You Have Rescued Me“]

[Verse]
I was alone, living a lie, losing my mind
Wondering why, I wasted my time
On dreamin?
Just when I thought I'd had
Enough, you came on by
Taking my hand, you lifted me higher
Give me the strength to survive

[Chorus]
You, baby, you have rescued me
You bring out the best in me
You are the one I want to fly with
Love, it is not reality
It became true fantasy
And I'll love you for eternity
Walks in the park, laughs in the dark
Feeling so high
Sharing today, who's caring about tomorrow
Can't get enough kissing and hugs
Holding your tight
New love it burns, mmm sets me on fire
Bringing my soul back to life
