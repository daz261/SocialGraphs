[Verse 1]
Standing with my enemy
Hung on my horns
With haste and reverie
Killing with charm

[Chorus]
Only happy when you hurt
Only deadly in a swarm
Only healthy in the dirt
Only empty in your arm

[Verse 2]
I play, I'm sick and tame
Drawing the hordes
I wait, and show the lame
The meaning of harm
The skull beneath my feet
Like feathers in sand
I graze among the graves
A feeling of peace

[Chorus]
Only bending when you break
Only feeding when you're cold
Only healing when you ache
Only feeling when you don't

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Only bending when you break
Only feeding when you're cold
Only healing when you ache
Only feeling when you don't

 

[Verse 1]
I think I know the answer
I stumbled on and all the world fell down
And all the sky went silent
Cracked like glass and slowly tumbled to the ground

[Chorus]
They all say if you look hard
You'll find your way back home
Born without a friend
And bound to die alone

[Verse 2]
I'm thinking of your highness
And crying long upon the loss I've found
And on the plus and minus
Zero chance of ever turning this around

[Bridge]
Why doesn't anyone believe in loneliness?
Stand up and everyone will see your holiness

[Chorus]
They all say if you look hard
You'll find your way back home
Born without a friend
And bound to die alone
