[Chorus]
Welcome millennium, the fall of planet hate
Welcome the end my friend, all the world's the stage
Welcome to the future, the world is black no turning
From the consequence of ignorance
Welcome to the fall

Beyond within, enact, enable
Create the past, nonexistent fables
Welcome to the fall

Tension, delirium, growing everyday
Another suicide shocks the world again, I watch in apathy
Bleed until tomorrow, whosoever does not believe in me
Welcome to the fall

Beyond within, enact, enable
Create the past, nonexistent fables
Welcome to the fall

Can I bring you down again, can I make you feel?
Can I lift you up into the dreaming trip surreal?
Can I taste the future shock, spit out all the games?
Do you know my name, do you know my number?
Cracking under strange constrictions, Mr. Ordinary Visionary

[Solo]

[Chorus]

Beyond within, enact, enable
Create the past, nonexistent fables
Beyond within, enact, enable
Create the past, nonexistent fables
Welcome to the fall of one man's sanity

 

Time has no meaning for me. She is gone
And the void speaks to me

You paint the sky in obsidian lies
And come what may never will I know how you changed time
The riptide lies ahead, all my passions now are dead
I can see the path you never thought to follow
I feel so hollow

I stand before you, a shadow of a man
Behind these eyes self destruction swims through my mind
I'm confusion and contempt, I am the void
You are the emptiness of black tomorrow
I feel so hollow

[Solo]

You paint the sky in obsidian lies
And come what may never will I know how you changed time
The riptide lies ahead, all my passions now are dead
I can see the path you never thought to follow
I feel so hollow
You are diseased
You are deceiver
