Music and words by Tolkki
Sign of the times and writings on the wall
They show me it's time has come
Order of a new kind we will all find
Stronger than never before
Things are pretty much the same
Like in the year thirty eight
Oh won't we ever learn
This time is't gonna be different
So let's all join our hands
And let the children sing
For the last time
4th Reich is rising
Can't you see the signs
4th Reich is rising
For the last time
Let's just press more money
Don't worry about the inflation
We got to have more weapons to carry on
Unemployment and sorrow cannot be avoided at this point
But thins will be so different when they are
Ruling the world
4th Reich is rising
Can't you see the signs
4th Reich is rising
For the last time
What will be left to our children
Is this our final destiny

 

Music and words by Tolkki
Everywhere I go I see people staring at me
It makes me feel so strange
Why won't they just leave me be
So take a look in the mirror
And maybe you'll see all the things that happened
While you were looking at me
Am I really so different
In the Eyes of the world
You are no different to me
In the Eyes of the world
Is it so hard to see now
Everything we do is running to the sand
And who is to take the food away
From the children's hand
We all could be friends now
And it's not a crime
But we have to be quick now
Because we don't have much time
Are we really so different
In the Eyes of the world
You are no different to me
In the Eyes of the world
Is it so hard to see now
