[Verse 1]
Put on that dress
I'm going out dancing
Starting off red
Clean and sparkling, he'll see me

[Verse 2]
Music play, make it dreamy for dancing
Must be a way that I can dress to please him
It's hard to walk in the dress, it's not easy
I'm swinging over like a heavy-loaded fruit tree

[Chorus]
If you put it on, if you put it on
If you put it on, if you put it on

[Verse 3]
It's sad to see
Lonely, all this lonely
Close up my eyes
Dreamy, dreamy music, make it be alright

[Verse 4]
Music play, make it good for romancing
Must be a way I can dress to please him
Swing and sway, everything'll be alright
But it's feeling so damn tight tonight

[Chorus]
If you put it on, if you put it on
If you put it on, if you put it on

[Bridge]
"You purdy thang," my man says
"But I bought you beautiful dresses"
"You purdy thang," my man says
"But I bought you beautiful dresses"

[Verse 5]
Filthy tight, the dress is filthy
I'm falling flat, and my arms are empty
Clear the way, better get it out of this room
A falling woman in dancing costume

[Chorus]
If you put it on, if you put it on
If you put it on, if you put it on
If you put it on, if you put it on
If you put it on, if you put it on
