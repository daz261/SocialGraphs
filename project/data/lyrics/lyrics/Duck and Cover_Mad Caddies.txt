What do you think of me
Do you really want to see
A piece of me that I hide
Something that is hard to find
What's behind your smile
Is it really worth my while
What's beneith your tan-bed skin
Open up and let me in

Do you really want to feel
Something that is so unreal
Do you really want to be
The one and only one for me
When we go to sleep tonight
I'll have different goals in sight
Tell you what you want to hear
Have another drink my dear

I'm not going to try to hurt you
I'll be honest, kind and true
I'll take you out and treat you right
Just like a decent man would do

Now I've got you in my grasp
Do not fear my checkered past
Have you now begun to see
This diabolic side of me
In your mind I'm always there
I guess you thought I really cared
Now it's time to say goodbye
You bit the hook, believed the lie

I'm not going to try to hurt you
I'll be honest, kind and true
I'll take you out and treat you right
Just like a decent man would do

Gonna modify my behaviour
Make you think I'm your saviour
Now that I'm inside your head
I'm gonna use you
Probably abuse you
You should have listened to what your mum said

I'm not going to try to hurt you
I'll be honest, kind and true
I'll take you out and treat you right
Just like a decent man would do
(Yeah right!)
