I can't recall the hurting words that I once said
So long ago, still indignation clouds your head
And it's enough to know the pain of losing friends
You perpetuate
Certain sensless hate
And I can picture you today
As you say "I used to know that guy"
And as you speak they watch your face split in two

And when you see me It's always, hey Joe, how is it goin' bro?
Where have you been man? We used to be such good friends
Two-faced, you don't care You know what you can do with it
I can't pretend
And you just want a war, man
And there you go again

You ought to bury the hatchet
And leave behind all of the lies and your disguise
You know that I just want to bury the hatchet
How much more will you permit?
Think about it you'll admit
You and I have got to bury the hatchet

Am I really all that bad?
Sometimes I second guess
Often times I wonder why my head is such a mess
Put yourself in my shoes and picture if you can
All these insecuriries create that bitter sad man
You see hurting

Not me

Not me

I forgive, I forget I won't say the things I'll regret
Not this time
I will stop
But just between you and me it's a loss

I can't recall the hurting words that I once said
So long ago, still indignation clouds your head
'Cause it's enough to know the pain of losing friends
Fingers point at you Isn't that what a child would do?
And as you speak they'd watch your face split in two
And when you see me It's always, hey Joe, how is it goin' bro?
Where have you been man? We used to be such good friends
Two faced, you don't care You know what you can do with it
Hypocrite
Don't give me that shit
