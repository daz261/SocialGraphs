Black thorn that pierced your skin
Come back down to Earth again
The cold is creeping deep inside
Disconnect the telephone lines

Got to get away, got to get away, get away
Got to get away before the Lord calls me to stay
All that I know, should've been, could've been mine

I killed the last way out of this
Persuaded by a deceitful kiss

Said you better stay, said you better stay, better stay
Said you better stay before it's all gone, gone away
All that I know, should've been, could've been mine
And for all that I know
Should've been, could've been mine

Bite the thorn that pierced the skin
Come back down to Earth again
The cold is creeping deep inside
Disconnect the telephone line

Got to get away, got to get away, get away
Got to get away before I lose my mind
Said you better stay, said you better stay, better stay
Said you better stay before it's all gone, gone away
All that I know, should've been, could've been mine
And for all that I know
Should've been, could've been mine
(repeat to fade)
