[Intro]
Nowhere, Shampoo, TV, Combat, Boy's Own
Slim tie, Showdown, Can't stop
Nowhere, Shampoo, TV, Combat, Boy's Own
Slim tie, Showdown, Can't stop

[Verse 1]
Where do we go from here?
There's something in the sky
Shining in the light
Spinning and far away

[Chorus]
Nowhere, Shampoo, TV, Combat, Boy's Own
Slim tie, Showdown, Can't stop, (Satellite)
Nowhere, Shampoo, TV, Combat, (Satellite), Boy's Own
Slim tie, Showdown, Can't stop, (Satellite)
Nowhere, Shampoo, TV, Combat, (Satellite), Boy's Own
Slim tie, Showdown, Can't stop

[Refrain]
Looking for satellites
Looking for satellites

[Verse 2]
Where do we go to now?
There's nothing in our eyes
As lonely as a moon
Misty and far away

[Chorus]
Nowhere, Shampoo, TV, Combat, Boy's Own
Slim tie, Showdown, Can't stop, (Satellite)
Nowhere, Shampoo, TV, Combat, (Satellite), Boy's Own
Slim tie, Showdown, Can't stop, (Satellite)
Nowhere, Shampoo, TV, Combat, (Satellite), Boy's Own
Slim tie, Showdown, Can't stop

[Refrain]
Looking for satellites
Looking for satellites

[Outro]
Where do we go from here?
