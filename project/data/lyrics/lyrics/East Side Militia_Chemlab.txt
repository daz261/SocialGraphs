Roulette's spinning, the wheel of distinction
Darwin's selected you, for total extinction
I'm everything you think is wrong with the world
I'm a slutty, dirty little girl
Beaten and scarred and ripped and mangled
Came for love and stayed for strangle
Crown the serpent, proclaim the king
And now you're worshipping the Wrong Thing
Where everything is wrong, and everything is right
And everything is wrong, and everything is right
(And covered up in black light)

The cracks are showing through
Well, I've got a message for you
There's something changing inside
But I know it's not right

Lick your daughter, fuck your son
Inside, I'm the truly Ugly one
Everything that you should stay away from
Infectious, it's all infected, the disease is liberated
Lurking just out of sight... we're gonna make it fit in real tight
A little closer, said the Spider to the Fly

The cracks are showing through
Well, I've got a message for you
There's something changing inside
But I know it's not right

I am nothing, you are nothing, we are nothing
I am nothing, you are nothing, we are nothing... nothing at all...
I am nothing, you are nothing, we are nothing, under the steel belted sky...
