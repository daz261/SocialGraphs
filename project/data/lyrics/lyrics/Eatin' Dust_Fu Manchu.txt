Man made way unknown, change course, back to home
From the scope they saw a shine like that close behind
By now the controller knew, full power chased by two
No one in the room could tell a wild story, yeah, oh, well

For a moment things went calm, no need to sound the alarm
The controller gave the word, planes vanish is what we heard
Did it happen like he said, "Better find out instead"
Rolling back in time, short notice but we'll try

Will they ever show orbiter lays low

Next morning we arrived on site, had a feeling something ain't right
Soon as the car door slammed, Hemi's keys were in my hand
Blown heads on a six fifty four, all right now we need one more
Orbiter is close at hand, we all agreed on a skyward plan

Will they ever show orbiter lays low

So now months passed us by, we're sure it was all a lie
Sun mirror was placed on high will let us know over time
