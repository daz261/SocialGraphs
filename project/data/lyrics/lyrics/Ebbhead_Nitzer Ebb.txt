Always told to take more care
But touch that skin and you'd be there
A voice so clear but far away
Picking up on every word I say

To tell the truth I can't even lie
No politician or a secret spy
I give to you
I give to you

No one else can make me
You pick me up and take me
You got it, you got it

My soul, it lies
My heart, it tries
My mind is spent
My love...

You can take it all
At your beck and call
I will give to you
I will give to you
I will give to you

I get up out of bed
I'm not alone, but nothing's said
I leave the room and go outside
Sunlight splash with every stride
To tell the truth, I don't even try
A life in knots that I don't untie

My soul, it lies
My heart, it tries
My mind, is spent
My love...

You can take it all
At your beck and call
I will give to you
I will give to you
At your beck and call
I will give to you
I will give to you

When the rain is falling
And the wind is calling
When the rain is falling
And the wind is calling
I give to you

When the rain is falling
And the wind is calling
When the rain is falling
And the wind is calling
I give to you

I give you life
I give you life
I give you life
At your beck and call
I will give to you
I will give to you
