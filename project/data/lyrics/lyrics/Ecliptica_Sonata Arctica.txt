[Verse 1]
My own land has closed its gates on me
All alone in world, it's scaring me
I am here to prove you wrong
I'm accused of something I live for

[Verse 2]
In my dreamland, there's one who understands
A friendly soul, trusting life in your hands
Yes, I gave it all I can
Now it's invaded by a stranger

[Chorus]
Keep in mind what you have heard today
You might find that you are not so brave
Are you man enough, carrying the load all alone
When others have your own

[Verse 3]
My old land is but a pile of sand
Cold and bare but something still is there
Yes, I gave it all I can
Now it's invaded by a stranger

[Chorus]
Keep in mind what you have heard today
You might find that you are not so brave
Are you man enough, carrying the load all alone
When others have your own

[Bridge]
I'm a true patriot, you are my land
You have my soul, you have all I had
Now I am here, and I want it all back

[Verse 4]
In my dreams, I climb the hills I see
And let a gentle breeze lead me to
Plains I once have seen and

Clear blue sky, I swim in lakes I find
I build a house right there
That you can't take, never take away

I am here to claim my land
You can't keep me away, forever

[Chorus]
Keep in mind what you have heard today
You might find that you are not so brave
Are you man enough, carrying the load all alone
When others have your own
Are you man enough, carrying the load all alone
When others have your own

 

[Verse 1]
All those lies suit you
They are custom made to
Drive you out of reality
Lies are true for you
You know, what you do is
Reaching a point of insanity

[Pre-Chorus 1]
When you wake from your dream you know what is true?
Ring of bell inside your head is playing with your mind

[Verse 2]
Remember to pray
And what the Bible says
And you will live through eternity
You haven't heard of this?
There is something you missed
It will cost you so heavily

[Pre-Chorus 2]
You must sleep in the stinking bed that you have made
When you're down where you belong hear what they say

[Chorus]
Stay for a while, stay forever
Sing for the times you are bound to betray
Run for your life, run forever
Your eyes tell a lie and the liar must always die

[Verse 3]
When you're done with him
You know where you have been
He will treat us all equally
Can you feel the fire burning

[Pre-Chorus 2]
You must sleep in the stinking bed that you have made
When you're down where you belong hear what they say

[Chorus]
Stay for a while, stay forever
Sing for the times you are bound to betray
Run for your life, run forever
Your eyes tell a lie and the liar must always die

[Chorus]
Stay for a while, stay forever
Sing for the times you are bound to betray
Run for your life, run forever
Your eyes tell a lie and the liar must always die
