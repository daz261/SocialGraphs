Did you ever think of me
As your best friend
Did I ever think of you
I'm not complaining

I never tried to feel
I never tried to feel
This vibration
I never tried to reach
I never tried to reach
Your eden

(Your eden. Your eden.)

Did I ever think of you
As my enemy
Did you ever think of me
I'm complaining

I never tried to feel
I never tried to feel
This vibration
I never tried to reach
I never tried to reach
Your eden

(Your eden. Your eden.)

I never tried to feel
I never tried to ...
(Your eden.)

 

And so many things I'd forgotten
In a world that we shared
With so many things for the asking
Never asked for the madness there
Strange how I find myself
So often on a distant shore

There's only one thing that's confusing
Was it you? Was it me?
With so many questions unanswered
Or was that part of your mystery?
Strange how I find myself
So often on a distant shore

So many things I'd forgotten

So many things for the asking

Strange how I find myself
So often on a distant shore
How I find myself
So often on a distant shore
