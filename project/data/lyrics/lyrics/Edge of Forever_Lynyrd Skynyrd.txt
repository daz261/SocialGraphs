[Verse 1]
You know I'm dirty because it's in me
Life's not easy
And it's the heart that I won't change
I wouldn't be the same
You see me one day and then the next day
I don't wanna play
I'm not the same dog you have known
It's not written in stone

[Chorus 1]
Well am I right or wrong
Looking out for number one
I never stay too long
I'm there and then I'm gone

[Chorus 2]
I'm not the preacher man
Oh can you understand
It's a game of win or lose
I've got an evil eye
You know sometimes I might lie
Oh I'm not the preacher man
Yeah-Yeah-Yeah

[Verse 2]
Saint was a sinner
Ain't he a winner
And did you hear him say
I didn't lie just as well
It's all in the head
Oh ain't it funny
How little money
Cheap talking honey
Can turn a sunny day to gray

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2][x3]

[Outro]
Aah aah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
Aah aah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
