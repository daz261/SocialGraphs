[Verse 1]
So you think I've come alive
Got my head out on the outside
Yeah, I've worn you like a brick
Yeah, now I'm sick
I move in time, I hear your face
It's all over the place
In everything I sing and do
Fuck you

[Verse 2]
I hear you've got a brand new beau
I hear he's lovely, white as snow
He moves in time, he moves real nice
I swear to God, that's my advice
It really makes the world unstick, yeah
Mama taught me how to dance and pray
And I said, "okay"
And then you made me feel like I was dead
Maybe it's just in my head

[Verse 3]
If I could live, I'd be the one
I would live and toll on
Yeah, I would never kiss your ass
I don't know where it's at
The complete derelicts in my life
I'm being really nice
I've gone blind, I'm missing teeth
I can't breathe
I'm a dirty old man who pissed on himself
Punching at a clock and screaming at the world I've healed
Yeah, I've healed
Yeah, I've healed
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
