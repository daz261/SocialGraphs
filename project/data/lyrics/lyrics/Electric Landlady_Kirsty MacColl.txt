I'm nearly sober
And I can see the truth
I'm not immune to the sorrow that you put me through
All I ever wanted
Was a little more respect from you

I used to love you
But now I feel abused
I was a fool to be blind to the things you do
All I ever wanted
Was a little more respect from you

I'll never understand
The habits of a man out on the town
And where he hangs around

Now you think it over
Decide what to do
I couldn't fall for your story if I wanted to
All I ever wanted
Was a little more respect from you

I tried to make you see
That you were losing me but every day
You still went out to play

And now I'll say for the last time
You had the chance
And I won't dance for you baby like you want me to
All I ever wanted
Was a little more respect from you

All I ever wanted was a little more respect

Children of the revolution coming out to play
Bombers ripped the night apart and blew the school away
Some live on the south side and they overlook the water
Some live on the north side and they're looking at the border
And those children of the revolution see the soldiers come
Smiling at the widows as they take away the sons
Children of the revolution shot down with a brand new gun
They're dropping down like flies and in their eyes
The images of war are in their eyes
They've seen it all before and know your lies
Won't keep their bellies full
In love and war there are no rules

Children of the revolution getting off the boat
To face the ignorance and prejudice that keep this land afloat
Children of the revolution make a brand new start
Running through the rubble of a thousand broken hearts and in their eyes
All promises are broken in their eyes
The words that can't be spoken and your lies
Don't keep their bellies full
In love and war there are no rules
But in their eyes
Murder comes by sea and from the skies
It's shiny and it's quick to take their lives
And if it's cruel in love and war there are no rules

Children of the revolution coming out to play
Someone sells a gun and someone blows them all away
Children of the revolution sold out by the banks
Who swap the green upon the dollars for the green upon the tanks
Children of the revolution shot down by a brand new gun
