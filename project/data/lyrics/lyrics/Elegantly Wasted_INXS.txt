[Verse 1]
Look at all that shines
Baby's down on the world and she knows it
If your spirit's running
Why don't me make it rain like we used to
We run, we hide
We wait and we want the good life
Aw sure you're right
This ain't, the good life

[Chorus]
Ah, Elegantly wasted
Ah, Elegantly wasted

[Verse 2]
Look at all the crimes
Baby's down on the world cause she owns it
Making up her life
Nothing more, nothing less makes it Voodoo
We run we hide
We wait and we want the good life
Aw sure you're right
This ain't, the good life

[Chorus]
Ah, Elegantly wasted
Ah, Elegantly wasted

[Verse 3]
We look at all that shines
Baby's down on the world and she knows it
If your spirit's fine
Why don't we make it rain like we used to
We run we hide
We want the good life
Aw sure you're right
This ain't, the good life

[Chorus 2]
Ah, Elegantly wasted
(you could be right, you could be certain, you could be right)
Ah, Elegantly wasted
Ah, Elegantly wasted
(you could be right, you could be certain, you could be right)
Ah, Elegantly wasted (feels like, feels like)

[Outro]
Elegantly wasted - you could be right
Elegantly wasted - you could be certain
Elegantly wasted - you could be right
Elegantly wasted - you could be right
Elegantly wasted - you could be certain
Elegantly wasted - you could be right
Elegantly wasted - you could be certain
Elegantly wasted - you could be right
Feels right, feels right
Elegantly wasted - you could be right
Elegantly wasted - you could be right
Elegantly wasted - you could be right
Elegantly wasted - you could be certain
Just like, just like
Elegantly wasted - you could be right
Elegantly wasted - you could be right
Feels right, feels right
Elegantly wasted Elegantly wasted
Elegantly wasted...Elegantly wasted
