[Verse 1]
The Devil weds a widow
Death another’s leftovers
Better to lie on a willows
Rest on alder boughs

[Verse 2]
Then upon a widow’s bed
On a used woman’s pillow
Sweeter the side of a fence
Than a widow’s flank

[Chorus 1]
Sweeter the side of a fence
Than a widow’s flank
Sweeter the side of a fence
Softer the side of a grove
Than a widow’s beside is
Softer the side of a grove

[Verse 3]
The Devil weds a widow
The grave one twice wed
A widow’s hand is rougher
Than a dry spruce bough

[Verse 4]
With which she strikes the playful
Grabs the one who laughs
A widow has had her games
And spent a merry evening

[Chorus 2]
Sweeter the side of a fence
Sweeter the side of a fence
Softer the side of a grove
Softer the side of a grove

[Outro]
With which she strikes the playful
Grabs the one who laughs
A widow has had her games
And spent a merry evening

 

[Verse 1]
The calloo's spirits are low
Swimming on the chill water
But the orphan's are lower
Walking down the village street

The sparrow's belly is chill
Sitting on the icy bough
But my belly is more chill
As I step from glade to glade

[Chorus]
The dove's heart is cold
As it pecks the village rick
But I'm colder still
As I drink the icy water

The dove's heart is cold
As it pecks the village rick
But I'm colder still
As I drink the icy water
