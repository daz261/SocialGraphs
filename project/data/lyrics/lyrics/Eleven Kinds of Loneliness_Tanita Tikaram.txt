I'm not there
If ever I was there
I'm sure I was never so bold
If ever I spoke so - I'm sure it's trouble

Not my trouble
I'm not so sure if I control this laughter
Everything herafter
Everything is bound to be trouble
Yeah, not my trouble
Trouble
No, not my trouble
If I was to blame
I'm sure we'll work it out
If I was to blame
I'm sure it was about

Trouble
Not my trouble
It's not my game
It's not mine
It's not my game

There is a tired face
A hiding to nothing face
A face that you keep to explore this trouble
You trouble me more and more
Trouble me more

I'm not certain
I ever could explain
Never certain
But I do need to explain

Trouble
Not my trouble
Trouble
It's not mine
