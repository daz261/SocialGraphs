[Intro]
Oh baby
Right back here in my arms
Right back here in my arms

[Verse 1]
Don't want you to write me no letters
Don't want you calling my phone
I just want you, I just want you
I just want you right back here in my arms

[Verse 2]
I ain't checking for the sweet talk, baby (Right)
Talkin' 'bout how you're missin' my charms (Right)
I just want you, I just want you
I just want you right back here in my arms
I just want you, I just want you
I just want you right back here in my arms

[Hook]
Right back here in my arms
(Oh baby)
Right back here in my arms
(Oh baby)

[Verse 3]
I know you got a lot on your mind (Right)
That's why I wanna give you some time (Right)
Till I get to, till I get to
Till I get to hug that body so fine
I know you need a little space, just a little
That's why I ain't showing my face (Right)
I just want you, I just want you
I just want you right back here in my arms

[Hook]
Oh baby
Right back here in my arms
Right back here in my arms
Right back right back
Right back here in my arms
Right back here in my arms

[Verse 4]
No, no, no to the postman bringing me letters
You know a brother gonna feel much better
If he keep his mind on, you know, whatever
Anything as long as it is making it wetter
Because I can't stop thinking about what we do
There ought to be a law against the hoochie ooh! (Ooh!)
(Can we groove?)
I don't want to do you no harm
I just want you right back here in my arms
Oh baby (Right back here in my arms)
Don't want you to write me no letters
I just want you, I just want you
I just want you right back here in my arms

[Hook]
Right back here in my arms
I just want you right back here in my arms
Right back here in my arms

[Outro]
I'll try to write you back
(Right back here in my arms)
