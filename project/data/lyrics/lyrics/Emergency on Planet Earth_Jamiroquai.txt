[Verse 1]
Everybody
Don't want no war, no
No, no, no
We're too young to die
(Too young to die!)
So many people
All around the world, yeah
All around the world
Seen their brothers fry
(I seen your brother fry)
What's the motive?
In that madness
Oh, I wish I knew, you made my people cry
(You made my people cry)
So politicians
This time
I think you'd better keep your distance
Say, sing it loud
We're too young to

[Chorus]
Do-do-do-do-do
Da-da-do

[Verse 2]
What's the answer?
I wish I knew
To our problems
I think we've gone too high
(I think we've gone too high)
Little children
Never said a word, now
You know they never said a word
Still they have to die
Well I'm asking why
It won't be long
No, no, no
Dancing like we do, yeah
Oh, like we do, now
To put this sad world right
(I gotta do it right)
So don't you worry
People, we don't have to suffer no more
Cause we're too young to

[Chorus]
Do-do-do-do-do
Da-da-do
Da-da-do-do
Do-do-do-do
Da-da-do

Do-do-do-do-do
Da-da-do
Da-da-do-do
Do-do-do-do
Da-da-do
Da-da-do

(Oh, don't you know)
(We're too young to die)
(Yeah, oh, I'm too young)
(I'm just too young)

[Bridge]
All gone when we drop the bomb
Can the politicians reassure?
Cause here I am
Presuming that
Nobody wants a war
There's so many people praying
Just to find out if they're staying
But lately stately governments
And disillusioned leaders
Are full of empty promises
But rarely do they feed us
Put our backs against the wall
Or don't we count at all?
Can you decide
Are you mesmerised?
Do you know which side you're standing?
Cause when it falls
Gon' take us all
Gotta know what we're demanding
I never lie
Can't you hear the cry
Coming from on high:
We're too young to die!

[Chorus repeats to fade]
Do-do-do-do-do

Da-da-do-do
Do-do-do-do

Do-do-do-do-do

Da-da-do-do
Do-do-do-do

Do-do-do-do-do

Da-da-do-do
Do-do-do-do

I'm so glad I've got you hooked up on my drug
Everybody dance to the music
Are you feeling well? Now you caught this bug
Everybody dance to the music
Think last time I took an overdose
Come on dance to the music
Hey, well it made me realize that I came too close
Now I'm gonna dance to the music, music, music
Yeah, come on now
Dead can seem to bear no relevance
Bet you wished you danced to the music
What you want to do is kill yourself
Still you don't dance to the music
I can look at you and hear your scream
Come on dance to the music
And you tell me that your needle's clean
Come on dance, dance
Come on now dance to the music
I need it, need it, need it
Come on now dance to the music
I need it, need it, need it, yeah
Come on now dance to the music
