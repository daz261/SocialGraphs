When he turned 34 but who's counting
He couldn't find anyone who wanted to party
So he walked around a playground with a bag of Mickey's Tallboys
And he heard the sound of laughter and he followed it for fifteen blocks
There was a house between Mavis and Water
They were out on the porch, they were inside playing quarters
And he said, "Don't you know the game Kazaam? It's a better game
You point your elbow at someone and say somebody else's name
And it alternates whose turn it is and if you lose you drink."
They said "Man, you really make us think
Yeah you make us think and so:

Tonight we're gonna be the party
We will party all night long
We are the party generation
So have a seat, what's in the bag?
Party on."

Round about one or two it started winding down
And he knew what they needed -- they needed donuts
So they walked out to Krispy Kroger's All Nite Sugar Palace
It was there in the doorway he said, "Oh, well maybe not."
Inside there were six women talking
They were the most justified angry ex-girlfriends
And they swiveled around slowly like they saw something bad
Through the eyes in the back of their heads
Like he always knew they had
And they said, "What a coincidence," and "Hey, you're just the man
We were saying that you did the best you could
You're fine, we understand and so--

Tonight we're gonna be the party
We will party all night long
We are the party generation
You were the best but we'll survive
Party on."

In the morning they sent him home with a designated driver
And he lay down and thought about the whole night
And he looked up at the photo that he bought at a junk shop
It was only fifty cents but he framed it and everything
It was the kind of party that you hope never ends
The lucky party boy surrounded by his friends
And they were all in pointed hats
Caught in a rebel birthday shout
And he was at the candles with his mom there to help him out
There was a lot that you could learn if you lay near them
Like if you listened you could hear them and he could hear them

They say:

Tonight we're gonna be the party
We will party all night long
We are the party generation
So lift your head and blow 'em out

Tonight we're gonna be the party
We will party all night long
We are the party generation
So lift your head lift your head
Party on

 

I never thought you were the letter writing type
Now I see the words you chose, the way you write
So I started to write back about the trees and the snow
And I saw a bird, couldn't say what it was
But I thought you'd know, you always surprised me

And if I wrote you, if I wrote you
You would know me and you would not write me again

And when the spring came and flooded all the streams
It's like how you got the night you told me all your dreams
And when the barn roof sagged after an icy bout
It's like how you shrugged when you knew
The truth was the only way out, but not the only way

And if I wrote you, if I wrote you
You would know me and you would not write me again

We drew our arms around the bastard sons
We never would drink to the chosen ones
Well you know the way I left was not the way I planned
But I thought the world needed love and a steady hand
So I'm steady now

And I'm so happy, I had to tell you
And I love you, and you will not write me again
You will not write me again
You will not write me again
