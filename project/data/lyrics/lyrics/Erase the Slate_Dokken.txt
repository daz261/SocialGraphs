Talking to my rabbit friend he seems so bright indeed
A conversation over tea
Then he told me / I'm standing all alone
There's a crowd of people eating at my throne
Is it just me / is it just you
Or is it everyone
I want the ordinary life
When the sky is dark I feel like it's light
I want the ordinary life
I must confess / I'm the maddest hatter
Of them all
And it's so contrary that I know I shouldn't
Watch the rainbows circle my friend mary
I wish that I could fly so I can see much more
I wish that I could see things
Like the others do
If it's just me / then it's just you
I'm not the only one

I want the ordinary life
When the sky is dark I feel like it's light
I want the ordinary life
I must confess / I'm the maddest hatter
Of them all
I want the ordinary
I wanna be with my friend mary
I want the ordinary life
When the sky is dark I feel like it's light
I want the ordinary life
I must confess / I'm the maddest hatter
Of them all
I want the ordinary life
When the sky is dark I feel like it's light
I want the ordinary life
I must confess / I'm the maddest hatter
Of them all
