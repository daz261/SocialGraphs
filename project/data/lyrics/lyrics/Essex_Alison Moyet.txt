[Verse 1]
When she said that you were through
I thought that there was nothing that I could do
Just because she ran right here
Doesn't mean I interfered
Now I'm wondering if we can feel the same

[Chorus]
Cause she keeps whispering your name
She keeps on whispering your name
Like she's just waiting

[Verse 2]
She once told me how she felt
Didn't just want me to hear it from someone else
There were unknowns she couldn't know
But she hoped you two would grow
And when you didn't she was brought to me in pain

[Chorus]
And she keeps whispering your name
She keeps on whispering your name
Like she's just waiting

[Bridge]
If it's just a little fling a simple thing
I'll try not to pretend
If it's just for jealousy she's using me
That might be hard to mend

[Verse 3]
Oh what else can I do
But try to give her more than she got from you
And when she wakes up suddenly and she says your name to me
I'll just hope it's force of habit and not need

[Chorus]
Cause she keeps whispering your name
She keeps on whispering your name
Like she's just waiting

[Outro]
Oh tell me what is fair
When nothing's wrong
And she just stares
Like she's just waiting
