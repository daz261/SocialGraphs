Yeah...
Well I bit off more than I could chew
I sucked awhile and spit it out
You met me once now who are you
You met me twice who am I to doubt
Built to please and raised to rock
Construction starts here on this block
Millenium has come at last
My one horse town is made of glass

My century...is turning
My century...is turning

Well so long to the so-so years
Of river mouths and chandeliers
Morning crews that make me yawn
I hold my heave until I'm gone
I cock an ear and crack a smile
Last in line and single file
The only ones standing at this speech
Are the ones with the brooms and the mops and the keys

My century...is turning
My century...is turning

Now I can't go back...it's my last chance
Now I can't go back...it's my last chance

Blacktop yards and sonic booms
Done heroin and in ladies rooms
Bouncing balls and spinning wheels
Electronic retail power deals
Turning calendars forgotten
Expiration date is rotten
Behind my eyes I've seen it all
Years go past upon the wall

My century...is turning
My century...is turning

My century...my century

 

They were gonna meet
On a Rocky Mountain street
Two bashful hearts beat in advance
Their hands were gonna sweat
It was all set
She ain't showed up yet
Still a good chance

It's a love untold
It's a love untold

Checking on her face
Checks his sleeve for his ace
And both just in case wear clean underwear
Games will be played
Excuses will be made
The stupid things they said
In their prayers

Oh about a love untold
It's a love untold

Soft hands slowly move across the blank white page
Thinking of words for my silent lips and fingers to obey

Soft hands slowly move across the blank white page
Thinking of words for my silent lips and fingers to obey

They were gonna meet on a crummy little street
It never came to be I'm told
Does anyone recall the saddest love of all
The one that lets you fall nothing to hold
It's the love untold...
Once upon a love untold
Just another love untold

They were gonna meet on a crummy little street
We were gonna meet on a crummy little street
