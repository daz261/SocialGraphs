Let it slide
Let it slide
Let it slide
Let it slide

They can make it sound so nice
Everybody's got a price
Ho, ho, ho, ho

Give it away
Give it away
Give it away
Give it away

Nobody's here to stay
They own you to the grave
Ho, ho, ho, ho

Try to hide
Try to hide
Try to hide
Try to hide

Everybody's got a price
They can make it sound so nice
Ho, ho, ho, ho

Hell to pay
Hell to pay
Hell to pay
Hell to pay

They own you to the grave
Nobody's here to stay
Ho, ho, ho, ho

 

[Verse 1]
I've made mistakes
That I'm sure I'll make again
Guess I liked them enough
The first time around
No way to fight 'em
No use denying
The way it grows
Uh-huh

[Verse 2]
Whatever happens
Never thought for a second
That I'd let go
Uh-huh

[Verse 3]
Everybody says: "you must've lost your head"
Well, one more time is good enough for me
Yeah, one more time is good enough for me

[Verse 4]
It's a hard road to your heart
And there was a time when I never thought I'd get that far
Uh-huh

[Verse 3]
Everybody says: "you must've lost your head"
Well, one more time is good enough for me
Yeah, one more time is good enough for me
