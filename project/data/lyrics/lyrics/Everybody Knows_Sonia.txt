Can you see in my eyes
That I was keeping my feelings inside
Should I be telling everybody
I don't know what to do

Are there the signs to recognize
Or has someone been telling me lies
I should never let a rumour
Change my point of view

It's just that I'm afraid that I could be
Falling in love too soon

Just listen to your heart that's what they say
Listen to your heart you'll be okay
Listen to your heart
Listen to your heart

Somewhere there's a truth you can't deny
That life is too short for goodbye
If I always let my heart
Control what's in my mind

It's just that I'm afraid maybe one day
Of breaking this heart of mine

Just listen to your heart that's what they say
Listen to your heart you'll be okay
Listen to your heart
Listen to your heart

Just listen to your heart and you will find
All your hopes and fears will turn out fine
Listen to your heart
Listen to your heart

It's just that I'm afraid that I could be
Falling in love too soon

Just listen to your heart that's what they say
Listen to your heart you'll be okay
Listen to your heart
Listen to your heart

Just listen to your heart and you will find
All your hopes and fears will turn out fine
Listen to your heart
Listen to your heart

Just listen to your heart that's what they say
Listen to your heart you'll be okay
Listen to your heart
Listen to your heart

 

If I had someone I could rely on
I'd give up my heart and my soul
I'd lose all my self-control
If I had someone I could rely on
I'd never turn my back on him
And if that boy was you
I'd open my arms and let him right in

I've been waiting, anticipating
That love would come to me
But hings just ain't that easy
Sometimes love is such a mystery

Got a picture in my mind
I want a very special kind of love
'Til then I'll be on my own

If I had someone I could rely on
I'd give up my heart and my soul
I'd lose all my self-control
If I had someone I could rely on
I'd never turn my back on him
And if that boy was you
I'd open my arms and let him right in

Now I've said it don't regret it
I put my faith in you
Now I've confessed this feeling
I'll soon discover if my dreams've come true

Every day I hope and pray
I need to know yhat you will stay with me
'Til then I'll be on my own

If I had someone I could rely on
I'd give up my heart and my soul
I'd lose all my self-control
If I had someone I could rely on
I'd never turn my back on him
And if that boy was you
I'd open my arms and let him right in

Got a picture in my mind
I want a very special kind of love
'Til then I'll be on my own

If I had someone I could rely on
I'd give up my heart and my soul
I'd lose all my self-control
If I had someone I could rely on
I'd never turn my back on him
I'd open up and let him in

 

I made such a big mistake
Trying to hide the way I was feeling
I laughed but my heart would ache
Something inside told me I needed
You more than the air that I breathe
You're not just one of the crowd
Now I'm wearing my heart on my sleeve
I wanna shout it aloud
I'm gonna climb to the top of a mountain
'Cos I'm not scared to tell the world I love you
I'm gonna climb to the top of a mountain
Calling out, you'll hear me shout
You are the one
Some things are worth waiting for
Now we're alone let's make this forever
I really couldn't ask for more
We're taking our time and we're so fine together
You've given me everything
And I don't want it to end
Who knows what tomorrow will bring
Baby until then
I'm gonna climb to the top of a mountain
'Cos I'm not scared to tell the world I love you
I'm gonna climb to the top of a mountain
Calling out, I'm gonna shout
I'm gonna climb to the top of a mountain
'Cos I'm not scared to tell the world I love you
I'm gonna climb to the top of a mountain
Calling out, you'll hear me shout
You are the one
Something inside told me I needed
You more than the air that I breathe
You're not just one of the crowd
Now I'm wearing my heart on my sleeve
I wanna shout it aloud
I'm gonna climb to the top of a mountain
'Cos I'm not scared to tell the world I love you
I'm gonna climb to the top of a mountain
Calling out, I'm gonna shout
I'm gonna climb to the top of a mountain
'Cos I'm not scared to tell the world I love you
I'm gonna climb to the top of a mountain
Calling out, I'm gonna shout
I'm gonna climb to the top of a mountain
'Cos I'm not scared to tell the world I love you
I'm gonna climb to the top of a mountain
Calling out, I'm gonna shout
I'm gonna climb to the top of a mountain...
