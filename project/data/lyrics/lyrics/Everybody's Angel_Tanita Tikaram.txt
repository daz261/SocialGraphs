[Verse 1]
One day to wonder what's bothering me
You said it
I'm just the half of this that just won't see
Believe it

If I am wishing I am hoping as well
Sometimes I
I tell you clearly
But it's hard to tell

Someone will watch me with an eager eye
But I'm not
I'm not even here to even try

If the rain stops calling
Calling my name
Well, I'm still in the thick of it
And bearing the shame

[Chorus]
(Deliver me)
Oh, no you don't deliver in me
(Deliver me)
Oh, no you don't deliver in me
(Deliver me)
Oh, no you don't deliver in me
(Deliver me)

One day you'll wake up
And then you'll see

[Verse 2]
Some times are hard, some times they drag
Well, I can see in your face
You've seen the half of this

Maybe I'm naming all the changes too much
But see you
You never leave it if you have to touch

And I will
Always be waiting with a happy smile
But the smile is just a-laughing
Killer, laugh awhile

Don't know what I'm doing here
I don't know if I'm sane
But I swear if I'm feeling this
I'm feeling the pain

[Chorus]
(Deliver me)
Oh, no you don't deliver in me
(Deliver me)
Oh, no you don't deliver in me
(Deliver me)
Oh, no you don't deliver in me
(Deliver me)

One day you'll wake up
And then you'll see

[Bridge]
Mmhmm

Mm hmm hmm hmm

Mm hmm hmm hmm

Hmm

[Verse 3]
I can't be your standard
Wish you away
I can't be all this much
See, you still have too much to say

Some skies are darkening; I call out loud
Well, I'm the good side of you
And I'm still proud to be
Waiting for lightness when you stray
Well, I'm sure that I hear him
He's slipping away

[Chorus]
(Deliver me)
Oh, no you don't deliver in me
(Deliver me)
Oh, no you don't deliver in me
(Deliver me)
Oh, no you don't deliver in me
(Deliver me)

But one day you'll wake up
And then you'll see

[Outro]
Mm hmm

Mm hmm hmm hmm

Mm hmm hmm hmm hmm

No, no, no, no, no, no, no

Deliver

 

A scene so simple
As if you're carried along
I've seen -
Some strange things and
He says:
"I'm used to winning"
Hearts abound
"I'm used to striking bands"
The sound
I'm used to turning every leading
Story in me
Believe this story in me

The scene's
A young man
It's the same self-same man
It's the - way you won me
A day ago -
It's strange to know so much
Always known too much
Always cared so much to take
Believe this story in me
Believe this story in me
Mm Hm Mm Hm Mm Hm

A scene -
So second
A scene -
So second best
I'm sure I'm saving you
When they look around
Here are the gathered
Here is the test of time
Here is what matters - in my heart
Yeah, maybe my heart's blind
In my heart
Yes - maybe my heart's blind
But I'm sure
I'm taking - believe this story in me
Believe this story in me
Mm Hm Mm Hm Mm Hm

Watch young scenery
Watch young
What's been burning here?
Well - you know it's
Seen the sun in me
Yes, you now it's
Seen the sun in me
Yes, you know it's warm and I feel better
I feel better, I feel better
