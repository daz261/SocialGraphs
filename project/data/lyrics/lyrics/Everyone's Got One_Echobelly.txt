Let the fear dislocate
Lest we frown upon the female agressor
Makes no sense, goes against the gender
Let her anger curse the years of oppression
Blame the mother, sell the sister
Before she blows you away

Won't someone give her a gun,won't someone
Won't someone give her a gun, won't someone

In a lifetime full of changes
A woman's group is still a second-class convention
Look around who has the power
Am I a big mouth with a fix of paranoia
On your side, on your side
Not here for the ride

Won't someone give her a gun,won't someone
Won't someone give her a gun, won't someone
Oh oh a gun

Half the population, one percent of wealth
Half the population, one percent of wealth
Blame the mother sell the sister
Blame the mother, sell the sister
Oh before I blow you away

Won't someone give her a gun, won't someone
Won't someone give her a gun, won't someone
Won't someone give her a gun, won't someone
Won't someone give her a gun, won't someone
