[Verse 1]
When the time grew near
For me to show my love
The longer I stayed away for
Hiding from a word I need to hear now
Don't think I'll hear it again (don't think I'll hear it again)

[Pre-Chorus]
But the nights were always warm with you
Holding you right by my side (right by my side)
But the morning always comes too soon
Before I even close my eyes (close my eyes)

[Chorus]
All I do each night is pray
Hoping that I'll be a part of you again some day
All I do each night is think
Of all the times I closed the door to keep my love within

[Verse 2]
If you can't forgive the past
I'll understand that
Can't understand why I did this to you
And all of the days and the nights so I regret it
I never showed you my love (I never showed you my love)

[Pre-Chorus]
But the nights were always warm with you (my love)
Holding you right by my side (right by my side)
But the morning always comes too soon
Before I even close my eyes (close my eyes)

[Chorus]
All I do each night is pray
Hoping that I'll be a part of you again some day
All I do each night is think
Of all the times I closed the door to keep my love within

[Bridge]
Surely we must be in sight
Of the dream we long to live (we long to live)
If you stop and close your eyes
You'll picture me inside
I'm so cold and all alone
Straight on back to me

[Chorus]
All I do each night is pray
Hoping that I'll be a part of you again some day
All I do each night is think
Of all the times I closed the door to keep my love within

[Outro]
Come on
Time is running out
You and me
Harmony
You and me...
You and me..
Forever more
That's what I told you

 

[Verse 1]
You've maybe seen me walk behind you
Follow you just everywhere you go
I've heard a whisper
They're telling me you've missed her
Know you're loving someone else instead of loving me

[Chorus]
So I've been wasting my time
Running after you girl
Wasting my time
Still I feel a sense of love
Never be mine
You're someone else's lady
Always on my mind
That I could steal your love away

[Verse 2]
Even now I know it doesn't change me
Maybe some day you'll be free again
Till then remember
Babe, I won't surrender
Hurts me when I know you're loving
Someone else instead of loving me

[Chorus]
So I've been wasting my time
Running after you girl
Wasting my time
Still I feel a sense of love
Never be mine
You're someone else's lady
Always on my mind
That I would steal your love away

[Bridge]
You said that you've been missing me
But how can that be, girl, how can that be, girl
Now all our plans that used to be passing us by
You say you wanna be free

[Verse 3]
Why'd you have to leave me?
Girl, I wouldn't leave you
I gotta have you
Girl, I gotta have you
Why'd you have to leave now?

I've gotta have you
Girl, I gotta have you
I really need you
I really, really need you
Wasting my time

[Chorus]
Wasting my time, running after you, girl
Wasting my time, still I feel a sense of love
Never be mine, you're someone else's lady
Always on my mind, that I could steal your love away

Wasting my time, running after you, girl
Wasting my time
Never be mine, you're someone else's lady
Always on my mind, that I could steal your love away

Wasting my time
Wasting my time, still I feel a sense of love
Never be mine, you're just someone else's lady
