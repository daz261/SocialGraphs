I need a break and I need one clean
Things are never what they seem
What seems close is so far away
You keep runnin' out of words to say, but I keep on singing anyway

'Cause I'm never goin' back there
No I'm never goin' back there
Folks don't really talk much about it anymore

'Cause it's a place with no way in it
It's a road to no way out
I'm asleep when I'm awake
Can't get a break
And I'm falling out
I'm falling down again
And I'm calling out
I'm calling out to you
Yes I'm falling out
I'm falling down again

'Cause it's a place with no way in it
It's a road to no way out
Everything ends in a heart ache
Can't get a break
And I'm falling out
I'm falling down again
And I'm calling out
I'm calling out to you
Yes I'm falling out
I'm falling down again
And I'm calling out
I'm calling out to you

No one calls much anymore
That's OK 'cause I don't use the phone
It feels better on your own
But don't get waisted every day alone

And I'm never goin' back there
I don't care
I don't want to talk much anymore

'Cause it's a place with no way in it
It's a road to no way out
Everything ends in a heart ache
Can't get a break
And I'm falling out
I'm falling down again
And I'm calling out
I'm calling out to you
Yes I'm falling out
I'm falling down again
And I'm calling out
I'm calling out to you

 

You have the right to be righted
And a right to be wrong
Just like a song Sly sang
There's a riot goin on

What's that to do with me
The shit ain't on TV
Guess the revolution missed me

Need some air
Don'tcha pass out
In a crowd
Need some air
Don't wanna hang out
With your crowd
I'm choking on the silence and I wanna scream out
Scream out loud
Need some air

Dozed to New York City and I musta been gone
Stuck in a rerun house, watchin Japanese porn
Said I needed some air
Got up outta my chair
The sidewalk up and hit me

Won't ya turn me on
Now all my teeth are gone
People closin' in like a riot
So give my world a spin come on and try it

Belleview woke me from a nightmare
Somebody up there really likes me
Stitches in my head
The revolution is dead
Dead, ya said

Need some air
I passed out
In a crowd
I need some air
Don't wanna hang out
With your crowd
I'm choking on the silence and I wanna scream out
Hey, scream out loud
I need some air
I heard you scream out HEY
Scream out loud
Need Some Air
