There´s a little old place
Down south of le grange
Where the whiskey flows and
The nights go on for days
My home on the range
There´s a sultry queen set her
Sights on me
Was the best damn thing that i
Ever seen oh ya
She´s evangeline

That preacher´s daughter
She took off her leather dress
She pulled me into sin and now
I must confess

She´s a sister, sister of pain
She´s a knock down, drag it
Out, lick it up to do it again

Such a sweet young thing took
A bite out of me
She spread her cards out for
All the world to see oh ya
I went willingly
She walked me back darkened room
Said this one´s on me boy
I want to see you howl at the
Moon and i´m talkin´ soon

That night I saw the light i´d
Never seen before

When I thought my time is up
She said how ´bout a, a little more

For the sister, sister of pain
She´s a knock down, drag it
Out, lick it up do it again
A sister, a sister of pain
Drop down, spread ´em out
Open up it´s only a game

Suck your soul, make a blind
Man see
With a touch of her hand
Brings a devil out of me
She held up a sign said
Have no fear
We got liquor up front, and
Poker in the rear

For the sister, sister of pain
She´s a knock down, drag it
Out, lick it up do it again
A sister, a sister of pain
Drop down, spread ´em out
Open up it´s only a game
Yeah

Sister, sister of pain
She´s a knockdown, drag it
Out, lick it up do it again
Yeah
