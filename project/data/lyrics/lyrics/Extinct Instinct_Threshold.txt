As we sailed through the clouds over plains of emerald green
A million dead unseen we were justifiably proud
They saw the doors opening they saw the smothered ground
They heard the fire ravaging we thrilled at every sound
Judges of the night with the calculus of godly might
Cause the world to weep as we lay your body down to sleep

How it all tortures endlessly gone tomorrow the same
Can you in all humility give all that power a name
When the kiss of a feather has worn the mountain down
In its annual orbit of the sun

When will the suffering cease and do we all deserve our peace
(destiny is but to run)
Will our wealth increase when will we all be released
(future's only just begun)

But it was not always like this now i gaze with jaundiced eyes
On the fruit of our exploitation i stop to wonder why
Where has it all gone all the time that we won
All our lives and all of this waste

When will the suffering cease and do we all deserve our peace
(destiny is but to run)
Will our wealth increase when will we all be released
(future's only just begun)

 

Give me a place to stand and I will move the world
Give me the right to speak and see my flag unfurled
The gods of war and the generous whore
Give me life in this tinsel town
But the shit I eat and the people I meet
Make me want to bring this curtain down

In the night time the shadows fall and I retire to lay down
The twisted chains and losses and gains of war
It's the right time to speak in rhyme of the fire gods that lay down
Read between all the shadows I've seen and more

I am falling down closer to the ground
(give to me your fairest deeds)
Teardrops are rising
Tell me where you're bound I will follow now
(I am he your fairy steed)
Teardrops are falling

Nightmare is coming and I hear the drumming
Of demons in the night
The space where my heart was is claimed by the servants
Of my subconscious flight
The wings that I fly on are taking me into
The underworld tonight
Where I perceive all my wildest dreams where I
Bring them all to life

All that stands before breaking human lore
(I'm your wildest fantasy)
Teardrops are running

Nightmare is coming and I hear the drumming
Of demons in the night
The space where my heart was is claimed by the servants
Of my subconscious flight
The wings that I fly on are taking me into
The underworld tonight
Where I perceive all my wildest dreams where I
Bring them all to life

Unicorn so wild and free, balm my eyes carry me home
Teardrops are drying

Nightmare is coming and I hear the drumming
Of demons in the night
The space where my heart was is claimed by the servants
Of my subconscious flight
The wings that I fly on are taking me into
The underworld tonight
Where I perceive all my wildest dreams where I
Bring them all to life
