[Verse 1]
Face in the gutter, eyes on the floor
Knocked down twice, can't take it no more
You got no vision in your head
You got no vision, better dead
Get on your feet, open the door
Walk on down, you know the score
It's a dead-end street back to the wall
You get it together you can get it all
The weak will fall, the strong remain

[Chorus]
No pain, no gain, yeah
No pain, no gain, yeah

[Verse 2]
No time for losers, you make the call
Believe in yourself, stand tall
Another day, it's in your hand
You can be the winner in the end
The weak will fall the strong remain

[Chorus][x2]

[Verse 3]
Keep running, don't look back
Keep moving, paint it black
Keep going, don't ever stop
There's time to rest, the day you'll drop
You roll the dice, you play the game
The weak will fall the strong remain

[Chorus][x3]

 

[Verse 1]
I'm an alleycat with only seven lives
I'm the trouble scratching at your door
When the moon is bright and shining high
I'm getting loose just like the night before
One for the money, two for the show
You can't resist it on a night like this
I'm the answer baby and you know
Tonight you're mine, forget the guy you're with

[Chorus 1]
Baby I don't care
If I have to crawl an extra mile
Because you can take me everywhere
And you're the one I really need tonight

[Chorus 2]
Someone to touch
I need a girl like you
Someone to touch
That somebody could be you

[Verse 2]
Don't try to tell me that your daddy's mean
You think your mama wouldn't let me in
Come on and step inside my dream machine
Don't fight it honey you just can't win

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]
Someone to touch
I need a girl like you
Someone to touch
That somebody could be you
Someone to touch
I need a girl like you
Someone to touch
Come on baby, I think it's you
