Sinking my teeth
Into you
Sweet obscenity
You're in too deep
For your own good

I'm commanding thee
Succumb to me
Set me free

Facing the animal
Walking the higher ground
Lost in a ritual
I close your eyes
And kiss you twice

Facing the Animal

The scent of your skin
Overpowers me
There is no remedy
It comes from within
The divinity
I just can't resist
Must admit
I'm losing it

Facing the animal

Facing the animal, yeah
Lost in a ritual
