[Verse 1]
You turn around
Then you ask me behind tears of doubt
Just what do I see in you
Please don't cry
I know sometimes it seems we barely get by
But you don't see how much you do
To get me through

[Chorus]
When the world is cold
And I need a friend to hold
You give me love
You give me love
And when my hope is gone
And I feel I can't go on
You pick me up
You give me love
You give me love

[Verse 2]
I apologize
If I never told you what you are in my eyes
Oh baby, let me tell you now
Every day
Looks sweeter knowing you'll be there in every way
Now how can you say that's not enough?

[Chorus]
'Cause when the world is cold
And I need a friend to hold
You give me love
You give me love
And when my hope is gone
And it feels I can't go on
You pick me up
You give me love

[Bridge]
You give me everything my heart desires
Morning sun and midnight fires
Someone there to share my dreams
With you I have everything

[Chorus]
When the world is cold
And I need a friend to hold
You give me love
You give me love
And when my hope is gone
And I feel I can't go on
You pick me up
You give me love

[Outro]
Yeah, when my world is cold
And I need a friend to hold me
You give me love
You give me love
And when my hope is gone
And I feel I can't go on
You pick me up
You give me love
Yeah, when my world is cold
And I need a friend to hold me
You give me love
You give me love
