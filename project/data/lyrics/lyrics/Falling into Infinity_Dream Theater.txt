[Verse 1]
There, there it is
I swear he's gonna murder that poor kid
Wait, I hear it again
Don't turn on the lights until we
Hear the way it ends

[Chorus]
Under Peruvian skies
Vanessa regretfully waits
The story unfolds in her eyes
Where midnight hysteria's
No big surprise
Battered and bruised
Always confusing
The love that she's losing for hate

[Post Chorus]
Poor Vanessa
Poor, poor Vanessa

[Verse 2]
Hey, I hope you know
I'm taking all of this with me when I go
Shame, you're not to blame
I'm the monster you created
In your daddy's name

[Chorus]
Under Peruvian skies
Vanessa regretfully waits
The story unfolds in her eyes
Where midnight hysteria's
No big surprise
Battered and bruised
Always confusing
The love that she's losing for hate

[Post Chorus]
Poor Vanessa
Poor Vanessa

[Bridge]
Terror by night
Liar by day
Telling her secrets
Won't take them away

[Guitar solo: John Petrucci]

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
Under Peruvian skies
Vanessa regretfully waits
The story unfolds in her eyes
Where midnight hysteria's
No big surprise
Battered and bruised
Always confusing
The love that she's losing for hate
