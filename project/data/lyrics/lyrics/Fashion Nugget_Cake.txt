To me, coming from you
Friend is a four letter word
End is the only part of the word
That I heard
Call me morbid or absurd
But to me, coming from you
Friend is a four letter word

But to me, coming from you
Friend is a four letter word
End is the only part of the word
That I heard
Call me morbid or absurd
But to me, coming from you
Friend is a four letter word

When I go fishing for the words
I am wishing you would say to me
I'm really only praying
That the words you'll soon be saying
Might betray the way you feel about me

But to me, coming from you
Friend is a four letter word
