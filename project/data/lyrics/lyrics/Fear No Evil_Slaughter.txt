Get used to it!

Ain't never gonna settle down
'Cause I've got something to say
I'm not gonna get pushed around
And nothin's gonna stand in my way
Well, I'm all pumped up and I'm ready to go
I'm gonna stand up and shout
And if ya don't like what I'm sayin' to you
Don't let the door hit ya on the way out

Get used to it
Ya gotta live out of control
Get used to it
'Cause rock n' roll is in your soul

Now listen up!

Nothin's ever gonna slow me down
I always got my foot on the gas
And if ya can't groove to these sounds
Well, pucker up and kiss my ass!
I'm like a 44 magnum on a shooting range
That's what I'm all about
And if you don't like what I'm sayin' to you
Don't let the door hit ya on the way out!

Get used to it
Ya gotta livе out of control
Get used to it
'Cause rock n' roll is in your soul
Yеah!

'Cause what you think of me
Is none of my damn business
I'm just gonna drive along
With my windows down
And the wind in my hair
And my middle finger in the air
Because rock n' roll is here to stay
And if you don't like it
My finger's gonna be pointin' your way!

So get used to it
Ya gotta live out of control
Get used to it
It's rock n' roll

Get used to it
Ya gotta live out of control
Get used to it
'Cause rock n' roll is in your soul

Yeah, damn straight, baby!
