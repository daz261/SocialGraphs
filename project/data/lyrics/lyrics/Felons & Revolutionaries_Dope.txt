[Verse 1]
I don't need diamond rings or high priced suits that shine
Limousines and flashing things or ancient bottled wine
Designer names and lavish things and million dollar hair
Modern dames without a brain, I never really care

[Hook]
I don't care nothin' about it!
Whoa, yeah!

[Verse 2]
I don't care for glitzy things or a fancy neighborhood
Glamour games or plastic fame or the king of Hollywood
Dazzling flamboyant things or a top hat on my head
Or modeling for magazines or to be a debonaire

[Hook]
I don't care nothin' about it!
Whoa, yeah!
I don't care nothin' about it!
Whoa, yeah!
Whoa, yeah!
I don't care nothin' about it!
Whoa, yeah!
Whoa, yeah!
Whoa, yeah!
Whoa!

 

If somebody's askin', I've gone away
Yeah, somebody's packin and gone today
The summer was lovely and I enjoyed my stay
Maybe I'll be back one day

Sorry to hurry, but I'll miss my plane
Don't worry about me, I'll be okay
See ya the next time, maybe you'll stop by
Maybe, well I'll try
Hopefully, but I guess

I never cared that much, yeah
I never kept in touch, yeah
And most of all, what really sucks is
Everything and all of us

So-and-so called me yesterday
So-and-so tells me that so's okay
I-don't-know took me far away
Hopefully, I'll be back one day

So many places, so many faces
Everything changes and everything's the same
So many places, so many faces
Everything changes, yeah, typical, but I guess

I never cared that much, yeah
I never kept in touch, yeah
And most of all what really sucks is
Everything and all of us

Everything sucks
Everything sucks

I never cared that much, yeah
I never kept in touch, yeah
And most of all what really sucks is
Everything and all of us
