Shoot yourself in the leg
& the goose lays the golden egg
I had that golden egg before
But it disappeared as I limped out the door
Never reveal what you know
That the whole thing is just for show:
A cardboard world with painted skies
Because we all must agree to believe in the lies
Bring yourself down to your knees
& they'll give you the golden keys
The keys will open any lock
To an empty room or a Chinese box
I can forget how I feel
& pretend that it's all for real
The pot won't call the kettle black
& I don't even feel the knife in my back
& when we go off to our bed
After struggling for our bread
A pleasant dream may stand instead
Of the clamor & noise that goes on in your head
So carry on like before
& don't listen to me any more
Don't believe a word I sing
Because it's only a song & it don't mean a thing

 

When the dream comes to an end
& I wake up once again
It's no surprise anymore
When the knock comes on my door
& I go from place to place
& always see your face;
But you're not there anymore
When the knock comes on my door
So I stayed awake all night
Trying to think things right
& I'm down on the floor
When the knock comes on my door
