Yes indeed I'm alone again
And here comes emptiness, crashing in
It's either love or hate, I can't find in between
'Cause I've been with witches and I've been with the queen

It wouldn't have worked out anyway
So now it's just another lonely day
Hey, hey
Further along, we just may
But for now it's just another lonely day

Wish there was something I, could say or do
I can resist anything but, the temptation from you
But I'd rather walk alone, than chase you around
I'd rather fall myself than let you, drag me on down

It wouldn't have worked out anyway
And now it's just another lonely day
Hey, hey
Further along, we just may
But for now it's just another lonely day

Yesterday seems like a, life ago
'Cause the one I loved today, I hardly know
You I held so close, in my heart oh dear
Grow further from me with every, falling tear

It wouldn't have worked out anyway
So now it's just another lonely day
Hey, hey
Further along, we just may
But for now it's just another lonely day
For now its just another lonely day
Hey, hey
For now its just another lonely day
