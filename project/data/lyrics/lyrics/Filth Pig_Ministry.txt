Well I started out younger at things that people start younger at
And a thousand days and nights of getting overexposed
Then someone asks, "How do you sleep at night?"
With the borrowed dreams from a broken past

You keep runnin' away don't matter how fast or long
You always wind up there
Another thousand pile-ups in the ugly name of morality
Fucking ugly, some creepy guy keeps asking
"How the fuck do you sleep at night?"
With a frozen dream and a borrowed hope that died

[Chorus 1]
Filth pig, filth pig
Filth pig
I sleep with both eyes open
Filth pig, filth pig
Filth pig

I keep chasing this tail but the tail gets bigger go figure
A thousand more stories keep the fires and flames alive
So how the fuck do I dream at night?
With the memories of a borrowed death, the guilty past

[Chorus 2]
Filth pig, filth pig
Filth pig
He sleeps with both eyes open
Filth pig
Filth pig, filth pig
Filth pig
He sleeps alright 'cause he's a
Filth pig, filth pig
Filth pig

 

Hot lava, come down
Big monkey flow
Chokin' on a color
Floating down like a rain (oh yeah)
Hot lava
Cool down
Big travel, every town
Roll it over with a ball and a chain

Hot lava
On the always to ready to burn
What the hell is in your
Lost and your found
Got lotta those time
Some owner lost
He wants nothin' but the kick underground

(Be healed, be healed!)
Hot lava, lava
(Be healed!)

Big kicka mule
Dipped in hot cotton
Make water like candy
And a fever like mine
Big boiler
Make rotten grey matter
Not spoiled like the child
Who pops them two at a time

(Be healed! Be healed!)
Hot lava, lava
(Be healed! Be healed!)

Lava
Lava
Lava
Lava
Lava
Lava

(Be healed!)

(Be healed! Be healed!)
Hot lava, lava
(Be healed! Be healed!)

(Be healed!)
Hot lava
(Be healed!)
Hot lava
(Be healed!)
Hot lava
(Be healed!)

Hot lava
Hot lava
Hot lava
Hot lava...
