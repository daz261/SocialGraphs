Let me tell you
I'd rather live than just imagine
Don't think there is a way around
And if I fail I'll still be standing
With my feet firmly on the ground
Through my window from the sky flows a lullaby
Someone's waiting in my dream
Taking me to places I've never been
If I had some wings then I could fly
In my dreams I am the dragonfly
I guess I always will be searching
I live and learn from my mistakes
And all the love that I'm expecting
Is equal to the love I make
Little dreamer when evening falls. shadows fall
Bring some honey for my soul
Take me to the places where I've never been
If I had some wings then I could fly
In my dreams I am the dragonfly
If I had some wings then I could fly
In my dreams I am the dragonfly
