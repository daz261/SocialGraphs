I guess the time is coming
You're gonna be out thumbing
Looking for another reason
To follow it, follow it through
I know you think you're winning
Everything you've ever given
I can tell you one thing true
I'm stalling for falling for you
But take it with a grain of salt
Know that it's not your fault
You can be a little blind sometimes

So won't you come back, come back
Instant replay, come back
Don't you kiss those dreams away
Come back, come back
You've been falling away for so long
So long, so long, so long
So long, so long, so long, ah, yeah

You can reserve opinion
You can keep the heads a-spinning
Doesn't matter what you do
You're keeping it in the fire
Tell me if it really matters
Tell me if you're getting shattered
Tell me if you're satisfied
Feeling so starry-eyed
Come in for a little while
I know that it's not your style
No such thing as self denial for you

Oh, won't you come back, come back
Instant replay, come back, yeah
I need you every day
Come back, come back
You've been away for so long
So long, so long, so long
So long, so long, so long, ah, yeah

I guess the time is coming
You're going to be out thumbing
Looking for the other side
Feeling so starry-eyed
You know it takes a couple of tries
I know sometimes you talk with your eyes
I know you keep it all inside sometimes

Oh, won't you come back, come back
Instant replay, come back
Oh, don't you kiss those dreams away
Come back, come back
You've been far enough away for so long
So long, so long, so long

Come back
Instant replay, come back, yeah
Won't you come back
Every day, babe, I need you
I need you
