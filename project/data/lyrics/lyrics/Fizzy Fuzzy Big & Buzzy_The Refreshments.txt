We could write our names here in the mud
No one's around to see them
We could hang our shoes here in a tree
No one's around to steal them
I could give you a star, you could give me one too
And that way we'd be even
And I could sing a song way out of tune
And not care a bit about it

We could both wear cowboy hats
And pretend that we could speak Italian
I could eat some gum and make my breath
So minty fresh to kiss you
Your breath will smell like wine, I like that a lot
Especially when I kiss you
And I could hit my funny bone real hard
And you could call me "sweetheart"

And whoever said there's nothing new under the sun
Never thought much about individuals
But he's dead anyway

So let's go down together
Down together, let's go down
Together, down together
Down together, let's go down
Together, down together
Down together, let's go down
Together, down together
Down together
Yeah, let's go

We could all wear ripped up clothes
And pretend that we were Dead Hot Workshop
I could drive long, long way
And not even have the gas to make it back
We could chase our shadows around the lawn
Until we're both exhausted
And I could forget the words here one more time
And hope that no one notices

And whoever said there's nothing new under the sun
Never thought much about me

Yeah, well, what's good for you is good for me
And what's bad for you is bad for me
And what's good for you is good for me
And what's bad for you is bad for me

Well, cars break down
And people break down
And other things break down too

So let's go
Down together, down together
Down together, let's go down
Together, down together
Down together, let's go down
Together, down together
Down together, let's go down
Together, down together
Down together
Yeah, let's go

All right, all right

We could find a speck of dust and scribble down our life story
