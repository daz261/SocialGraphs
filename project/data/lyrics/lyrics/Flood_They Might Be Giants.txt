Why is the world in love again?
Why are we marching hand in hand?
Why are the ocean levels rising up?
It's a brand new record for 1990
They Might Be Giants' brand new album Flood

 

[Chorus]
I lost my lucky ball and chain
Now she's four years gone
Just five feet tall and sick of me
And all my rattling on

[Verse 1]
She threw away her baby-doll
I held on to my pride
But I was young and foolish then
I feel old and foolish now

[Verse 2]
Confidentially, she never called me baby-doll
Confidentially I never had much pride
But now I rock a bar stool
And I drink for two
Just pondering this time bomb in my mind

[Chorus]
I lost my lucky ball and chain
Now she's four years gone
Just five feet tall and sick of me
And all my rattling on

[Post-Chorus]
She walked away from a happy man
I thought I was so cool
I just stood there whistling
"There goes the bride" as she walked out the door
"There goes the bride" as she walked out the door

[Verse 3]
I could shake my tiny fist and swear I wasn't wrong
But what's the sense in arguing when you're all alone?
Sure as you can't steer a train
You can't change your fate
And when she told me off that day
I knew I'd lost my home

[Verse 4]
Confidentially, I never told you of her charms
Confidentially, we never had a home
But this railroad apartment was the perfect place
When she'd sit and hold me in her arms

[Chorus]
I lost my lucky ball and chain
Now she's four years gone
Just five feet tall and sick of me
And all my rattling on

[Post-Chorus]
She walked away from a happy man
I thought I was so cool
I just stood there whistling
"There goes the bride" as she walked out the door
"There goes the bride" as she walked out the door
"There goes the bride" as she walked out the door

 

[Chorus]
This is where the party ends
I can't stand here listening to you
And your racist friend
I know politics bore you
But I feel like a hypocrite talking to you
And your racist friend

[Verse 1]
It was the loveliest party that I've ever attended
If anything was broken I'm sure it could be mended
My head can't tolerate this bobbing and pretending
Listen to some bullet-head and the madness that he's saying

[Chorus]
This is where the party ends
I'll just sit here wondering how you
Can stand by your racist friend
I know politics bore you
But I feel like a hypocrite talking to you
You and your racist friend

[Chorus]
This is where the party ends
I can't stand here listening to you
And your racist friend
I know politics bore you
But I feel like a hypocrite talking to you
And your racist friend

[Verse 2]
Out from the kitchen to the bedroom to the hallway
Your friend apologizes, he could see it my way
He let the contents of the bottle do the thinking
Can't shake the devil's hand and say you're only kidding

[Chorus]
This is where the party ends
I can't stand here listening to you
And your racist friend
I know politics bore you
But I feel like a hypocrite talking to you
And your racist friend

 

Mr. Horrible
Mr. Horrible
Telephone call for Mr. Horrible
But before he can talk
To the ugliness men
There’s some horrible business left
For him to attend to
Something unpleasant has spilled on his brain
As he sponges it off they say

“Is this Horrible?
Is this Horrible?
It’s the ugliness men, Mr. Horrible
We’re just trying to bug you
We thought that our dreadfulness
Might be a thing to annoy you with”

[Chorus]
But Mr. Horrible says, “I don’t mind
The thing that bothers me is
Someone keeps moving my chair”

“Would you mind if we balance this glass of milk
Where your visiting friend accidentally was killed?
Would it be okay with you if we wrote a reminder
Of things we’ll forget to do today otherwise
Using a green Magic Marker, if it's alright
On the back of your head?”

Mr. Horrible
Mr. Horrible
We’re not done with you yet Mr. Horrible
You have to try on these pants so the ugliness men
Can decide if they’re just as embarrassing as we think
We have to be sure about this

[Chorus]
But Mr. Horrible says, “I don’t mind
The thing that bothers me is
Someone keeps moving my chair”

Someone keeps moving my chair

[Chorus]
But Mr. Horrible says, “I don’t mind
The thing that bothers me is
Someone keeps moving my chair”

 

I'll never know what you'll find
When you open up your letter box tomorrow
'Cause a little bird never tells me anything I want to know
She's my best friend, she's a sparrow
And I'll never never know
What you never never never want to know
When you know what you are, O

If I had a pair of eyes on the back of my head for each time
You forgot to take out all the things you forgot to talk about
When you took a bite out of my spine
I would have a lot of eyes on me by this time, wouldn't I?
Wouldn't that just be fine?

Too late or soon to make noise about love and there's no time for sorrow
Run around in the rain with a hole in the brain till tomorrow

I'll never know what you'll find
When you open up your letter box tomorrow
'Cause a little bird never tells me anything I want to know
She's my best friend, she's a sparrow
And I'll never never know what you never never never want to know
When you know what you are, O

 

Hot Cha, where are you?
Everybody's eyes are closed
I can't see why I miss you so
So, hot Cha, where are you?

First time hot Cha went away
A floating island was his home
Then the phone rang off the hook
And hot Cha had to come back home

Hot Cha, where are you?
Everybody's eyes are closed
I can't see why I miss you so
So, hot Cha, where are you?

Second time he went away
Left the bathtub running over
Stereo on and cooking bacon
Never came back to tell us why

If that honey would come back
We would throw such a party
Drink and cook the prodigal son
Fondue forks for everybody

Hot Cha, where are you?
Everybody's eyes are closed
I can't see why I miss you so
So, hot Cha, where are you?
Hot Cha, where are you?
Hot Cha, where are you?

 

Hang on...hang on tight...

They might be giants (Boy)
They might be giants
They might be rain
They might be heat
They might be frying up a stalk of wheat

They might be giants (Boy)
They might be giants
They might be brain
They might be washed
They might be Dr. Spock's back-up band

...To make the merry-go-round go faster
So that everyone needs to hang on tighter
Just to keep from being thrown to the wolves...

Tabloid footprints in your hair
Tabloid footprints everywhere
We can't be silent
'Cause they might be giants
And what are we gonna do unless they are

They might be giants (Boy)
They might be giants
They might be bald
They might be snow
They might be something else in the snow

Hang on tight...

They might be giants (Boy)
They might be giants
They might be fake
They might be lies
They might be big, big, fake, fake lies

Tabloid footprints in your hair
Tabloid footprints everywhere
We can't be silent
'Cause they might be giants
And what are we gonna do unless they are

They might be giants... (Boy)
They might be giants... (Boy)
They might be giants... (Boy)
They might be giants... (Boy)

They might be giants... (Boy)
They might be giants... (Boy)
They might be giants... (Boy)
They might be giants... (Boy)

They might be giants... (Boy)
They might be giants... (Boy)
They might be giants... (Boy)
They might be giants... (Boy)

They might be giants... (Boy)
They might be giants... (Boy)
They might be giants... (Boy)
They might be giants... (Boy)
