[Verse 1]
Hot summer streets
And the pavements are burning
I sit around
Trying to smile
But the air is so heavy and dry

[Verse 2]
Strange voices are saying
(What did they say?)
Things I can't understand
It's too close for comfort
This heat has got right out of hand

[Chorus]
It's a cruel (cruel), cruel summer
Leaving me here on my own
It's a cruel (it's a cruel), cruel summer
Now you're gone, you're not the only one, it's a cruel...

[Verse 3]
The city is crowded
My friends are away
And I'm on my own
It's too hot to handle
So I got to get up and go

[Chorus]
It's a cruel (cruel), cruel summer
Leaving me here on my own
It's a cruel (it's a cruel), cruel summer
Now you're gone, you're not the only one, it's a cruel...
Cruel (cruel), cruel summer
(Leaving me) Leaving me here on my own
It's a cruel (it's a cruel), cruel summer
Now you're gone, you're not the only one, it's a cruel...


[Bridge]
Mmm, now don't you leave me
Mmm, now don't you leave me
Now don't you leave me, come on, come on
Mmm, now don't you leave me
Mmm, now don't you leave me
Now don't you leave me, come on, come on

[Chorus until Fade]
It's a cruel (cruel), cruel summer (cruel summer)
Leaving me here on my own (Leaving me here on my own)
It's a cruel (it's a cruel), cruel summer
Now you're gone, you're not the only one, it's a cruel...
Cruel (cruel), cruel summer
(Leaving me) Leaving me here on my own
It's a cruel (it's a cruel), cruel summer
Now you're gone, you're not the only one, it's a cruel...
It's a cruel (cruel), cruel summer
