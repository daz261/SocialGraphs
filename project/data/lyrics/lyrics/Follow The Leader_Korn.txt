[Verse 1]
Something takes a part of me
Something lost and never seen
Every time I start to believe
Something's raped and taken from me, from me
Life's gotta always be messin' with me (You wanna see the light)
Can't they chill and let me be free? (So do I)
Can't I take away all this pain? (You wanna see the light)
I try to every night, all in vain, in vain

[Pre-Chorus]
Sometimes I cannot take this place
Sometimes it's my life I can't taste
Sometimes I cannot feel my face
You'll never see me fall from grace

[Chorus]
Something takes a part of me
You and I were meant to be
A cheap fuck for me to lay
Something takes a part of me

[Verse 2]
Feelin' like a freak on a leash (You wanna see the light)
Feeling like I have no release (So do I)
How many times have I felt diseased? (You wanna see the light)
Nothing in my life is free, is free

[Pre-Chorus]
Sometimes I cannot take this place
Sometimes it's my life I can't taste
Sometimes I cannot feel my face
You'll never see me fall from grace

[Chorus]
Something takes a part of me
You and I were meant to be
A cheap fuck for me to lay
Something takes a part of me

[Bridge]

Go!

[Hook]
So buy, something on the ming-a-boo
Buy, some things they buy
So, something on the ming-a-boo
Buy, some things they buy
Buy, something off the hee-a-hoo
No, some things they buy
Buy, something on the ming-a-hoo
Buy, some things they buy

[Chorus]
Something takes a part of me
You and I were meant to be
A cheap fuck for me to lay
Something takes a part of me

[Outro]
Part of me
Part of me
Part of me
