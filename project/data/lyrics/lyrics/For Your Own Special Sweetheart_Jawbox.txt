Hey angel, consider your position
Framed to be consumed
Savory
Savoring your sympathy
Hey angel, fly over and bless me
See you feign surprise
That I'm all eyes
And you're all you need to be
Hey angel, whatever position
We consider fit to put you in
You'll protest your complicity

Easy now
One hand will wash the other
One hand will wash the other

Hey angel, fly over and bless me
See you feign surprise
But I'm all eyes
And we're all we need to be, need to be

Easy now
One hand will wash the other
One hand will wash the other

 

A minute, a second
A half-life, a minus
A segment, a blinder
Elective detention
It's secession time
Paid for by cutting backwards
It's election time
Letting every insult become presidential injury

(I'm begging you just hold my head up)
This last disgrace, breathe in my face
Bleed in distaste, bless this amen
Final lesson

A minute, a second
A half-life, a minus
A second reminder
Selective attention
It's secession time
Paid for by cutting backwards
It's insurrection time
Letting every insult be accepted into history

(I'm begging you just hold my head up)
This last disgrace, breathe in my face
Bleed in distaste, bless this amen
Final lesson (Na-na-na)
Final lesson

This last disgrace, bless this amen
Final lesson (Na-na-na)
Final lesson (Na-na-na)
Final lesson (Na-na-na)
Final lesson (Na-na-na)
Final lesson
