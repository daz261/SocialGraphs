"Here she is, direct from the convent, Miss Dixie Leonard"

I was alone on a shelf
In a world by myself
Oh, where could my prince charming be?
But a man came along
Made my life like a song
And taught me these words of ecstasy
Tenderly

I want some huggin' and some squeezin'
And some muggin' and some teasin'
And some stuff like that there
I want some pettin' and some spoonin'
And some happy honeymoonin'
And some stuff like that there

I used to think that love
Was just a lot o' rubbish;
A mess o' cabbage, a mess o' cabbage
But now my attitude
Is wholly lovey dovish
And baby, you, you've done it!

I want some kissin' and some hopin'
And some missin' and some mopin'
And some stuff like that there
I want some leapin' and some chasin'
And some weepin' and some pacin'
And some stuff like that there

And when I get a certain feelin' I confess it
There's really only one expression to express it
I want some huggin' and some squeezin'
And some muggin' and some teasin'
And some leapin' and some chasin'
And some weepin' and some pacin'
And some stuff
I want some stuff like that there

I used to think romance was bunk
A double mickey for the ickey
But all at once my heart was sunk
And baby, you, you've done it!

I want some kissin' and some hopin'
And some missin' and some mopin'
And some stuff like that there
I want some leapin' and some chasin'
And some weepin' and some pacin'
And some stuff like that there

And when i get a certain feelin' i confess it
There's really only one expression to express it
I want some huggin', squeezin'
Muggin', teasin' and some stuff
Stuff like that there!
Oooooooooh!
