In the friendship of lovers
Lives the joy of the heart
And when trust is forsaken
Our whole world falls apart

And when the wind cries you're with me
And tears say enough
And when the song prays for love

Young hearts forever
Don't wait one moment this time
Love is forever
(with somebody like you, yeah)
The young hearts survive

On the wings of an angel
Ooh a child learns to fly
And little by little
The sands move through time

And I can live a lie
But I think I know better

Young hearts forever
Don't wait one moment this time
Love is forever
(with somebody like you, yeah)
The young hearts survive

Here in the darkness
She dances alone
Roses from yesterday
Will she ever know

(guitar solo)

Oh...

Young hearts forever
Don't wait one moment in time
Love is forever
(with somebody like you, yeah)
The young hearts survive

(with somebody like you, yeah)

Young hearts
Young hearts
When love is forever
Young hearts
(one moment in)
Forever
Forever
Forever
(with somebody like you, yeah)
Give me just a little more time
She was an old flame of mine
I remember
I remember

We were lost and alone
Somewhere so very new
Caught in the magic of love
And your forgiveness
Selfish and too blind to see
Love was our music and, oh

I am
Lost in a world of emptiness
I am
Learning to tell the truth

Somewhere, somebody new
We shared, faith without truth
With only my words left I turn
To your forgiveness
Eyes in the darkness they cry
Tears are forever and oh

I am
Lost in a world of emptiness
I am
Learning to tell the truth
So many roads to choose

(guitar solo)
Whoa ooh...
Ooh ooh
Whoa...

I am
Lost in a world of emptiness
I am
Learning to tell the truth

I am
Lost in a world of emptiness
I am
Learning to tell the truth
So many roads to choose
