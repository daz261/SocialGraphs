[Verse 1]
Together we have discovered
The languid fatigue of love
Interrogated all our beauty
We've turned each other inside out

[Chorus]
Drowning in
Ebony tears

[Verse 2]
Long face of cheerlessness
The only bonding we share
Enlightened by degradation
The only pleasure is pain

[Chorus]
Drowning in
Ebony tears

[Verse 3]
Embedded in our resentment
Lay the keys to disengage
Still we burn in persecution
For the punishment of possessiveness

[Chorus]
Drowning in
Ebony tears
