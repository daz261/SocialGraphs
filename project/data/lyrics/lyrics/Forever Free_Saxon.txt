Listen now, heed the warning
Can't you hear the planet's cries
With the storm comes the fury
Mankind looks towards the sky

Burn the wheat (*)
Feed the fire
On the wind
Rising higher
There's a hole in the sky
Are we blind
Hole in the sky
Can't you see

Come the sun, come the wind
Ultraviolet radiation
Bring the flood from the sea
Breaking down communication

(Repeat *)

Listen now, heed the warning
Bring the land to devastation
Come the thunder, come the rain
See the end of all creation

(Repeat *)
