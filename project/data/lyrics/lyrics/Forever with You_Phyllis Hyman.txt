(Phyllis)
Funny how love goes
I wish I had never met you
(Damon)
I wish I had never seen your face
(Phyllis)
Cause now I can't forget you
(Damon)
The memory of you is too much for me to take

(Phyllis)
There was a time when you were mine
I couldn't wait to see you, hold you in my arms

(Damon)
Oh how I would yearn
And my heart would burn with love for you, you

(Phyllis)
You and me we got along so good
I thought our love would last forever

(Damon)
Suddenly things changed
Now the mere mention of your name

(Phyllis)
Makes me sad and blue
Oh I'm missing you

(Phyllis)
Funny how love goes
I wish I had never met you
(Damon)
I wish you had never come into my life
(Phyllis)
If I could just forget you
I know that everything would be alright
Everything would be alright

Late at night when I'm fast asleep
I can hear you calling out my name
(Damon)
When will it end
(Phyllis)
There's no need to pretend
I still love you the same
Ooh yes I do

(Damon)
If I could just put my pride aside
I'd come running back to you

(Phyllis)
But I know it wouldn't do any good
Because I did the best I could
It would be the same thing again
Oh, oh yeah

(Phyllis)
Funny how love goes
I wish I had never met you
(Damon)
I wish I had never tasted your love
(Phyllis)
Cause now I can't forget you
The memory of you is too much for me to take

(Phyllis & Damon)
Funny how love goes
(Damon)
Funny how love goes
(Phyllis)
Funny how love goes
(Damon)

Funny how love goes

(Phyllis)
Talking about you baby
(Damon)
I can't, I can't
(Damon)
I can't baby
Love, love, love, love

Fade

 

Hey, hey
Oh, wo, wo

I am not ashamed in any way
Of how I've my life
Held my head up high
Never once did I run and hide
Why should I compromise
I never live a lie

Take your time to understand me
If you want to share my life
Please don't think that I'm demanding
Its just the way I am
And now I need to know
How far we can go

CHORUS
I've been waiting so long [so come right or not at all]
Time for you to be strong [come right or not at all]
Show respect for me [a little love and honesty]
Even more sincerity [so come right or not at all]

If you come to me unselfishly
I'll treat you like a king
I will hold you tight
Each and every night
Tenderness is all that I possess
I really must confess

I would rather be here lonely
Than be mistreated by you
If you really want to know me
Just look into me eyes and make me realize
There's no need to hide

CHORUS
I've been waiting so long [so come right or not at all]
Time for you to be strong [come right or not at all]
Show respect for me [a little love and honesty]
Even more sincerity [so come right or not at all]

Deep down in my heart
There's a very special place
That so few people ever get to see
So if you want to get close to me
All you got to do is show me some sincerity

Sh-show me
Show me baby
Show me
Aw come on and show it
I need to know baby
Come on baby
You need to be there for me
[ad-lib]

CHORUS
I've been waiting so long [so come right or not at all]
Time for you to be strong [come right or not at all]
Show respect for me [a little love and honesty]
Even more sincerity [so come right or not at all]

CHORUS
I've been waiting so long [so come right or not at all]
Time for you to be strong [come right or not at all]
Need to be strong
Show respect for me [a little love and honesty]
Yes indeed, take your time to understand me [so come right or not at all]
Even more sincerity [so come right or not at all]

CHORUS
I've been waiting so long [so come right or not at all]
Too long
Time for you to be strong [come right or not at all]
Need you right there
Show respect for me [a little love and honesty]
Even more sincerity [so come right or not at all]
