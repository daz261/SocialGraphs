Stand
Stand and walk
Tragedy
Is cheap and so is talk
Decision
Yours to make, what will you do?
In the end
It comes back to you
‘Cause it's a long way to fall

Thunder
Don't scare me at all
Lightning
Well just a little
Pressure
It ain't worth a dime
And your wounds
They'll all heal in time
‘Cause it's a long way to fall

The answers are getting harder
The answers are getting harder
The answers are getting harder
(If an answer comes to those who pray)
The answers are getting harder
(If an answer comes to those who pray)
The answers are getting harder
(If an answer comes to those who pray)

The answers are getting harder and harder
And there ain't no way to bargain or to barter
But if you've got the angst we got the ardor
You might faint from the fight but you're gonna find it
For every challenge could have paradise behind it
And if you accept what you have lost and you stand tall
You might just get it back and you can get it all
So now you know why it's a long way to fall
Yeah, ‘cause it's a long way to fall
It's a long way to fall

(But badiddela da de doo badidela da nn deddle da nn do etc.)

Stand
Stand and wallk
Stand

 

You'll get no answer from me
About what I want or what I get
Brave enough to speak, afraid to see
Confuse the issue till you forget

And I've tried
To finally decide
Why
I'm in your face

And if you can't already tell
I am unable to let things go
I'm told I do it very well
But more important you should know

That all the same
You've got no one to blame
But yourself
If you call that a waste

‘Cause it ain't me
That's been hurting you inside
And if you've learned
You'll know much more than I

That you're gonna have to go and find it
I could dig beneath the ground
You'll have to unearth every ugly stone
That kept you on your own
And simply put them down
You're gonna have to look around

You'll get no answer from me
About what I get or what I want
That was enough to make her leave
She's not the first one come and gone

And I don't care
Buyer beware of me
‘Cause it might get rough

If you want peace then live alone
If you wanna hide then find a stage
Each a brief but perfect home
To accommodate your rage

And sometimes
In the midst of all my crimes
I feel lost
Or have I lost enough?

Remaining friends
Remind me as they say
It's up to you
The things you throw away

And still you're gonna have to go and find it
You'll have to dig beneath the ground
You'll have to unearth every ugly stone
That kept you on your own
And simply put them down
You're gonna have to look around
You're gonna have to look around
You're gonna have to look around
