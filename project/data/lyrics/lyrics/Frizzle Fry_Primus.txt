[Verse 1]
Too many puppies are being shot in the dark
Too many puppies are trained not to bark
At the sight of blood that must be spilled
So that we may maintain our oil fields

[Refrain]
Too many puppies
Too many puppies

[Verse 2]
Too many puppies are taught to heel
Too many puppies are trained to kill
On the command of men wearing money belts
That buy mistresses sleek animal pelts

[Refrain]
Too many puppies
Too many puppies
Too many pup-pup-pup-pup-pup-pup-puppies
Too many puppies

[Verse 3]
Too many puppies with guns in their hands
Too many puppies in foreign lands
Are dressed up sharp in suits of green
And placed upon the war machine

[Outro]
Too many puppies are just like me
Too many puppies are afraid to see
The visions of the past brought to life again
Too many puppies, too many dead men

 

Hello, all you boys and girls
I'd like to take you to the inside world
It's quite an irregular place to be
But never fear, you're safe with me
Well, maybe

Golden hair of macramé
Against the face that's cut from stone
The white porcelain's screaming, "Ayie!"
Thank God the boy's not alone

I don't believe in Santa Claus
I don't believe in spite
I have no use for beauty dolls
Especially on this night
I don't believe in miracles
I don't believe in lies
I don't believe in holograms
For I am the Frizzle Fry

Andy's painting green again
This time they might take him away
When Barrington starts to breathe again
It may just take us all away

I don't believe in charity
I don't believe in sin
And if you don't believe in me
We'll play this tune over again
I don't believe in pinochle
And I don't believe I'll try
I do believe in Cap'n Crunch
For I am the Frizzle Fry

 

[Intro]
One, two

[Verse 1]
When he was young you'd not find him doing well in school
His mind would turn unto the waters
Always the focus of adolescent ridicule
He has no time for farmer’s daughters
Alienated from the clique society
A lonely boy finds peace in fishing
His mother says, "John this is not the way life's supposed to be
Don't you see the life that you are missing?"

[Chorus]
And he says
When I grow up I want to be
One of the harvesters of the sea
I think before my days are done
I want to be a fisherman

[Verse 2]
Now years gone by, we find a man that rules the sea
He sets out on a dark May morning
To bring his catch back to this small community
He doesn’t see the danger dawning
Four hours up, oh, the ocean swelled and swelled
The fog rolled in, it started raining
The starboard bow, oh my God, we're going down
They do not hear his frantic mayday

[Chorus]
As he says
When I grow up I want to be
One of the harvesters of the sea
I think before my days are done
I want to be a fisherman

[Outro]
I'll live and die a fisherman
Call him John the fisherman
Call him John the fisherman
We call him John the fisherman

 

[Verse]
We are gathered here today in the majestic halls of old
To honor a man they call Sathington Willoughby
There's a joke or two a pun or three I feel that must be told
Then I go on to speak of Sathington Willoughby
Sathington Willoughby, the legislator
That penned us up a bill, that banned the use of certain things

[Outro]
Like this and that
(this and that)
This and that
(this and that)
This and that
This and--
