[Verse 1]
It's twelve o'clock and it's a wonderful day
I know you hate me, but I'll ask anyway
Won't you come with me to a place in a little town?
The only way to get there's to go straight down
There's no bathroom and there is no sink
The water out of the tap is very hard to drink

[Pre-Chorus]
Very hard to drink

[Chorus]
You wait 'til tomorrow
You wait 'til tomorrow

[Verse 2]
You say that money isn't everything
But I'd like to see you live without it
You think you can keep on going living like a king
Ooh, babe, but I strongly doubt it

[Pre-Chorus]
Very hard to drink
Very hard to drink

[Chorus]
You gonna wait 'til, fat boy
Fat boy, wait 'til tomorrow
You gonna wait 'til, fat boy
Fat boy, wait 'til tomorrow

[Chorus]
You wait 'til tomorrow
You wait 'til tomorrow
You gonna wait 'til, fat boy
Fat boy, wait 'til tomorrow
You gonna wait 'til, fat boy
Fat boy, wait 'til tomorrow
Oh, yeah

 

[Verse 1]
Unsuspecting brother doesn't know what to do
When everything just falls to the ground, oh

That his friend will never be found
When he's informed, that he

[Chorus]
Will never see the boy
Will never see the boy
Never see him open his eyes
Will never see the boy
Never see the boy
You'll only hear his heavenly cries
Oh, yeah
Uh, huh

[Verse 2]
Thinking of the past, it's all over now
Mother nature strikes once again
It happened all so fast, my only question's how
How could they let that building descend
Oh, yeah
Uh, huh

[Chorus]
Will never see the boy
Will never see the boy
Never see him open his eyes
Will never see the boy
Never see the boy
You'll only hear his heavenly cries
Oh, yeah
Uh, huh

[Verse 3]
Off to the new life, I live on death
You're leaving me all through the night
If he's born again, I need you to find
Need you to find where he is
