Laughter echoes through the night
The evening star shines over Midgard
Evil mingles in the dark
The organised cosmos' enemy comes forth

Loke, the son of F†rbaute.. father of lies
Born of earth, unbound by laws

Takk weeps no heavy tears
For the loss of the sun's handsome son
But the mare in the woods submits
For the regaining of Foster brother's favour

Loke, the son of F†rbaute.. father of lies
Born of earth, unbound by laws

The salmon glides in the waterfall
The eagle sails with the wind
Hammer groans in Jotun scull
The under ground spurts fire

Laughter, deceit, beauty and contempt
The old norse god's protector and leader of Jotuns

 

Forget all laws, all order and peace
Chaos is everything; no time or place
Now when all light and life ends
When the wind now is killing
The chains has broken...

The time has come
As the norns predicted
Nothing lasts forever
The battle at Vigrid shall come
There is no brothers
There is no strong bounds
The bound anger is loose
Inner coldness is free
A river of foam
Has dried up
The power of the wolf, obscure hate
No longer sees a limit

Angrboda beared
Her name justly
With Lauyíus son she breeded
Dread, hate and death
A cry of warning in the dark
The mountains roofs, bear tendors
Woman beard, the sound of catsteps
Breath from the fish, spit from the bird
Tamed forces from a forgotten time
Has held our world in chains
But not for ever!

Fenris is loose

Now our wisdom
Is swallowed by ancient hate
The nine steps are fulfilled
A new road is lain
