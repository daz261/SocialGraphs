I'll call you sister Carrie but I'll never say it
Beauty to a whisper
Has your solar sister
The magnet will deliver
An arrow from the quiver
I'll call you sister Carrie but you'll never hear it
Fifteen minutes later
As time pulls down her fader
And nibbles off the fakers
Who roll under the breakers

I'll close my eyes and listen to you read the story
Knowing I'll soon be left behind
So won't you read sister Carrie Jean, sister Carrie
Always the patient one

I'll call you sister Carrie I won't breathe a word
Frosting on the beater
The flag trips down the meter
You thought you could defeat her
You're lucky you could meet her

I'll close my eyes and listen to you read the story
But I'm already far behind
So won't you read sister Carrie Jean, sister Carrie
Always the patient one

I'll close my life and let you teach me a new story
Out of the pages of your mind
And magnet will deliver
Suspend my solar sister

And you can read, sister Carrie, read

 

Can you hear it?-like an invitation
Can you feel it?-it's a revelation

The flavor of the month is busy melting in your mouth
Getting easier to swallow and harder to spit out

Can you hear it?-does the sound remind you?
Can you feel it?-it's gonna redefine you

The flavor of the month is busy melting in your mouth
Getting easier to swallow and harder to spit out

Can you hear it?-like an invitation
Can you feel it?-a reverberation

The flavor of the month is busy melting in your mouth
Getting easier to swallow and harder to spit out
