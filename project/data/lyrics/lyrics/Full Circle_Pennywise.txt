A burning plane as it's going down
The last scream before it hits the ground
A lost ship on a raging sea
A blinking distress signal of emergency
A run away train careening off the tracks
The last breath before a heart attack
The earthquake as it shakes your room promising falling skies in impending doom

~Chorus~
--
One chance you feel it
Before you meet with your destiny
One chance you need it
To come to terms with mortality
All that's important to me
Everything inside of me
All that's trivial will fade and soon recede
You will see when on a date with destiny
---
Look in the jaws of your own demise
Watch your life pass before your eyes
Did you live like a dream come true or did you just survive?
Did you do all you could do?
In a fall from a burning tower
What would you do with just one more hour?
Live that hour out everyday Like it was your last you'll live much better that way

Chorus 2X

When you're on a date with destiny
You're on a date with destiny (3x)
