Oh, so fine
We were trying
Out of nowhere
Just in time
Let you take me
Deep down the river
Kiss the changes
That shape my life

Always
Left behind
All the tracks that
I could find
Do do do do do
All these scars are mine

I was thinking got the feeling
The gift you gave
Is gonna last forever

All the lies you find
All the truth you see
Rise and fall
But I know what's mine
Here we lie
Looking up to
Empty sky
And the promises we find

I'm not the first one
To ask why
Yeah, yeah

Do do do do do
Do do do do do
All we ever try

I was thinking
Got the feeling
The gift you gave
Is gonna last forever

I was thinking
Got the feeling
The gift you gave
Is gonna last forever

Do do do do do
Do do do do do
All these scars are mine

Do do do do do
Do do do do do
All these scars are mine

I was thinking
Got the feeling
The gift you gave
Is gonna last forever

All the lies you find
All the truth you see
Rise and fall
But I know what's mine

I was thinking
Got the feeling
The gift you gave
Is gonna last forever

All the lies you find
All the truth you see
Rise and fall
But I know what's mine

 

There are river's running
Just for you and me
In the darkest hours
Choices made to be
I choose to pull my punches
Don't you test my conscience
You'll see
You'll see

Cut your teeth and make your peace
That's what you asked for

Cut your teeth and make your peace
That's what you asked for

Cut your teeth and make your peace
That's what you asked for

Cut your teeth and make your peace
That's what you asked for

Got a way of getting
What I want to see
When you know I'm winning
You'll get over me
All the trash your thinking
Don't you feel it sinking
You'll see
You'll see

Cut your teeth and make your peace
That's what you asked for

Cut your teeth and make your peace
That's what you asked for

Cut your teeth and make your peace
That's what you asked for

Cut your teeth and make your peace
That's what you asked for

All the bitter fighting
Makes no sense to me
Were only talking circles
Loosing sympathy
No time like the future
Make signs cause I need ya

There are river's running
Just for you and me
In the darkest hours
Choices made to be
I choose to pull my punches
Don't you test my conscience
You'll see
You'll see

Cut your teeth and make your peace
That's what you asked for

Cut your teeth and make your peace
That's what you asked for
[repeat to end]
