I looked into your eyes
They told me plenty
I already knew

You never felt a thing
So soon forgotten
All that you do
In more than words
I tried to tell you
The more I tried I failed

I would not let myself believe that you might stray
And I would stand by you no matter what they'd say
I thought I'd be with you until my dying day

Until my dying day

I used to think my life
Was often empty
A lonely space to fill

You hurt me more than I ever could have imagined
You made my world stand still
And in that stillness
There was a freedom I never felt before

I would not let myself believe that you might stray
And I would stand by you no matter what they'd say
I thought I'd be with you until my dying
Day

Until my dying day
