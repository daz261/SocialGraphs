[Intro]
Hip hop, do it 'til you drop
Don't stop, don't you ever stop
Na na na, na na na, na na na na
Na na na, na na na, na na na na
Na na na, na na na, na na na na
Na na na, na na na, na na na na

[Rap: Wayne Wayne]
This is it and you know I'll run it freestyle
To the club to see En Vogue, I'll run a country mile
A dope hat, combat boots, I'm comin', cutie pies
Yo, I know En Vogue will love me 'cause I'm too fly
My jerkin' dance'll make 'em stare, and yo, give a laugh
Ask them to dance, they'll look me over and say, 'Oh no, we'll pass'
That's okay, I'll just dance and do my own thang
But when the night is over they'll remember Wayne Wayne

[Chorus - Maxine (En Vogue) Dawn]
Hip hop lover (Hip hop, do it 'til you drop)
You're too young for me (Don't stop, don't you ever stop) Do it to me, baby
Hip hop lover (Hip hop, do it 'til you drop)
You can't dance with me (Don't stop, don't you ever stop)
Do it to me, baby

[Verse 1 - Terry]
Me and my girlfriends broke down to the club
The minute we stepped in
We were being asked to the dance floor, yeah
Before I got his name, he was hittin' on me strong
But I knew from the conversation
He was a bit too young, yeah

[Chorus - Maxine (En Vogue) Dawn]
Hip hop lover (Hip hop, do it 'til you drop)
You're too young for me (Don't stop, don't you ever stop) Do it to me, baby
Hip hop lover (Hip hop, do it 'til you drop)
You can't dance with me (Don't stop, don't you ever stop)
Do it to me, baby

[Verse 2 - Maxine (Wayne Wayne)]
Brown leather combats, sales tag on his hat
He wore his clothes all inside-out (Yo, mental tip!) Oh
He had a funky step and I thought he was so cute
But as far as me hooking up with him
He had to come harder than that, yeah

[Chorus - Maxine (En Vogue) Dawn]
Hip hop lover (Hip hop, do it 'til you drop)
You're too young for me (Don't stop, don't you ever stop) Do it to me, baby
Hip hop lover (Hip hop, do it 'til you drop)
You can't dance with me (Don't stop, don't you ever stop)
Do it to me, baby

[Verse 3 - Terry]
When the set was over, we headed out to the car
He politely asked to walk me out
Huh, he's playng good so far
The minute I blinked my eyes, he snuck in a little kiss
So I swung out quick to smack him one
But I'm glad I missed

[Chorus - Maxine (En Vogue) Dawn]
Hip hop lover (Hip hop, do it 'til you drop)
You're too young for me (Don't stop, don't you ever stop) Do it to me, baby
Hip hop lover (Hip hop, do it 'til you drop)
You can't dance with me (Don't stop, don't you ever stop)
Do it to me, baby

[Bridge]
Na na na, na na na, na na na na
Na na na, na na na, na na na na

The beat may drop but not like all the others

[Chorus - Maxine (En Vogue) (Dawn)]
Hip hop, do it 'til you drop
Don't stop, don't you ever stop
(Do it to me, baby)
Hip hop, do it 'til you drop
Don't stop, don't you ever stop
Hip hop lover (Hip hop, do it 'til you drop)
You're too young for me (Don't stop, don't you ever stop)
(Do it to me, baby)
Hip hop lover (Hip hop, do it 'til you drop)
You can't dance with me (Don't stop, don't you ever stop)
Hip hop lover (Hip hop, do it 'til you drop)
You're too young for me (Don't stop, don't you ever stop)
(Do it to me, baby)
Hip hop lover (Hip hop, do it 'til you drop)
You can't dance with me (Don't stop, don't you ever stop)
(Do it to me, baby)
Hip hop lover (Hip hop, do it 'til you drop)
You're too young for me (Don't stop, don't you ever stop)
(Do it to me, baby)
Hip hop lover (Hip hop, do it 'til you drop)
You can't dance with me (Don't stop, don't you ever stop)
