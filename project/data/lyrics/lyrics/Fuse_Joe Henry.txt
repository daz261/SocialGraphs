If I know my angels, I know what they'd say
Be still my little butcher boy, you'll give us all away
Be still you wretched little freak, give us room to move
Give us milk, you little pig, we'll tell you when we're through

My love is like a mountain, her mouth is like a mine
Incubating diamonds, as we rise and shine, shine
Rolling over granite, there's a smell like cloves and clay
And if I know my angels, they'll take it all away

Can you get it?

Now I've sold my bread, to keep my spirits high
To keep some taste on my tongue, and my feelings dry
They'll have their fun and leave me, I'm like a stone without a weight
But if I know my angels, I'll fall just like a king

I can't get it

 

Here comes the night, there go your knees, reaching for the floor
You say I'll stand guard down here, she stands in the door
With a pony on the tether pulling cold and sugarcane

There go your knees
And there she goes
She's a-hauling cane like it was gold

And when she calls upon the dead
To stand up in her place
They'll raise the roof up overhead
And speak out from her face
And fish jump in her boat all day
And flog your feet like steel

There go the dead
Out through the roof
She speaks your name
Like it was proof

The carnies kick the gravel
And they wait for you in town
They pull back on the lever
And they bring the truck around
But her fingers on her lips
Are like a penny for a fuse

And it would take
All the world to go
The town will burn
For all you know
