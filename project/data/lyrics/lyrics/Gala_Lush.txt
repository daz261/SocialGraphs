Sunbathing, and she came down from above
Close my eyes and I feel like I'm in love
Wrapped in silk, how I got here I don't know
Tastes like milk and there's nowhere else to go

Soft red lips, slowly open wide
Honey drips and I long to feel inside
Deep and warm, the only to place to be
Sleep til dawn, then she does the same for me

Drawn fine line, heal my bad spine
Close together, now its all mine
Wake in sunlight, sunlight bleak white
Realise she's gone
