Follow the one
Evil masked in pride
Charisma to lead
Speeches laced with hate

Leading the dense
The bovine human herd
Inherently stupid
The fools deserve this fate

Warfare begins
Cities are ablaze
Tortured screams
Skin turning black

Carbonization
They will all burn
Mass execution
They will all die

Burning the world
And all of it's life
Throwing all the people
In a pit of fire

Watching the sheep
Gathering to die
Followers in life
Follow to the grave

Follow the one
Evil masked in pride
Charisma to lead
Speeches laced with hate

Leading the dense
The bovine human herd
Inherently stupid
The fools deserve this fate

Warfare begins
Cities are ablaze
Tortured screams
Skin turning black

Carbonization
They will all burn
Mass execution
They will all die

Pile the bodies
Set them aflame
The human race
Sentenced to burn

Burning flesh
Miasma of their death
Civilisation
It is destroyed

Pits of corpses
Unholy grave of war
Hanging victims
Guilty of free thought

Warfare begins
Cities are ablaze
Tortured screams
Skin turning black

Carbonization
They will all burn
Mass execution
They will all die

Pile the bodies
Set them aflame
The human race
Sentenced to burn
Pile the bodies
Set them aflame
The human race
Sentenced to burn

War of fire shred their souls
Burn in hell doomsday's toll
Failed to see the trap they laid
Demagogues lead them into the flames

Pile the bodies
Set them aflame
The human race
Sentenced to burn
Pile the bodies
Set them aflame
The human race
Sentenced to burn
