Bits and pieces of love for you
So sweet and simple
Yet I'm frightened by the way you feel

Little by little you touch my heart
Where they had touched it too
And as I smile I catch myself

Trouble me or I'll go
Trouble me with you
Spider, spider, crawl up my leg
Guilty and poison-free
I wish that I could be like you

Trouble me or I'll go
Yeah I'm human too
Over and over the need needs filled, a human weakness
And as I act I hate myself

Bits and pieces of love for you, so sweet and simple yet
I'm frightened by the way you feel
And as I act, I hate myself
