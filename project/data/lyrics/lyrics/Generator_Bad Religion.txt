[Verse 1]
A refreshing plunge
A drink of palatable water
A deep inspiration on a warm summer day
A safe stroll in a middle-of-the-road community
A neighbor who, in times of need, will not turn away

[Refrain]
I ain't no politician
I am a citizen
And I wonder if I'm living too far out of bounds

[Verse 2]
Community protection, rehabilitation
Police that serve without legitimate right to maim
Global awareness, ecological guilt
Cultural and environmental awakening

[Refrain]
I ain't no optimist
I try to be a realist
And I wonder if I'm thinking too far out of bounds

[Chorus]
Is it too much to ask?
Could it be the Earth is shrinking? (Could it be)
I can see the walls closing in
No one can take much for granted anymore

[Verse 3]
Remote control
Three cars for every family
Corruption at the expense of the simple majority
A violent clash
A plunder of the third world
Any wretched ploy that bolsters our economy

[Refrain]
I ain't no blind supporter
I'm a conscious citizen
And I know that we are living too far out of bounds

[Guitar Solo]

[Refrain]
(Ah) Ain't no politician
(Ah) Ain't no blind supporter
(Ah) I ain't no mouth to feed
(Ah) I am a citizen
And I wonder if I'm living too far out of bounds

[Chorus]
Is it too much to ask?
Can we keep the Earth from sinking? (Can we keep)
I can see the walls closing in
No one can take much for granted anymore
(You better not take it for granted anymore)
I'm not taking nothing for granted anymore
