Hyperactive

I just am, I never tried to be
Hyperactive, I like to get crazy
And I got friends who can keep up with me
And when we're out, we like to go full speed
You and me, yeah
You and me
I'm hyperactive, I can't help myself
I'm hyperactive you should watch yourself
'Cause I'm hedonistic and I stay up all night
And I don't know what's wrong
And I don't know what's right
I'm hyperactive, I can't help myself
I'm hyperactive, you should watch yourself
'Cause I'm hedonistic, know what I like to do
And, baby, I wanna play with you
It's in my genes, my triple energy
But I don't get triple morality And
I can try, but I'm not promising
To keep you safe, baby, when you're with me
I'm hyperactive, I can't help myself
I'm hyperactive you should watch yourself
'Cause I'm hedonistic and I stay up all night
And I don't know what's wrong
And I don't know what's right
I'm hyperactive, I can't help myself
I'm hyperactive, you should watch yourself
'Cause I'm hedonistic, know what I like to do
And, baby, I wanna play with you
