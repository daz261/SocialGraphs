Drivin' fast to live
Not to know
I got my .44
I'm tearin' up the asphalt
Drivin'
My engine just can't take much more
Tryin' to be the one, I got to beat you down
I gotta lead the pack
When you know I got my gun
You know I'm havin' fun
I'm gonna make it back

Gonna hunt you down with my .44
I got my pedal to the floor
Dontcha mess around with my .44

You see me comin' down the line
With my CG's open wide
I blow my hammer back
And you can swing and check
Let my bullets fly
Take a little drink now give it to me
My .44
Get in my seat
Then I hit the line
I see you in my sight
You know I'm gonna take another life

Gonna hunt you down with my .44
I got my pedal to the floor
Don't mess around with my .44

Gonna hunt you down with my .44
I got my pedal to the floor
Don't mess around with my .44
Gonna hunt you down
Said hunt you down
Gonna hunt you down with my .44
Got my pedal to the floor
Dontcha fuckin' mess around

No
No
No, No
No, No
Don't mess around
