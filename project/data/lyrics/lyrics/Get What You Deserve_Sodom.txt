Say your little prayer to god every day
And you will not burn in hell
You think the way you live you life is right
But I think it is not

Your mind's fucked up by serving
Some one you don't know
You don't if it's real
If you really wanna bop then find
Some one and bop until the end of time

Say your prayers to god every day
And you all will burn in hell
The lies they tell you won't come true
And in the end you simply die
