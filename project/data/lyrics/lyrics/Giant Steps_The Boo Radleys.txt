I don't need you preachin'
Tellin' me points of law
I got my own problems
Trying to stay off the floor

As the vultures circle
And the bills and demands fill the floor
It's been three weeks and three days
Since I last stepped out my door

This is my life too
This is mine

Jesus this room's so cold
But you've got your own problems
I can't see an end to it all
