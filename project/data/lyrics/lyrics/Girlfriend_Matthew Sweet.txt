[Verse 1]
I wanna love somebody
I hear you need somebody to love
Oh, I wanna love somebody
I hear you're looking for someone to love

[Chorus]
'Cause you need to
Be back in the arms of a good friend
And I need to
Be back in the arms of a girlfriend

[Verse 2]
I didn't know nobody
And then I saw you coming my way
Oh, I didn't know nobody
And then I saw you coming my way

[Chorus]
Don't you need to
Get back in the arms of a good friend?
Oh, 'cause, honey, believe me
I'd sure love to call you my girlfriend

[Bridge]
Hoooo
(One, two, three, four)
Alright

[Chorus]
Don't you need to
Get back in the arms of a good friend?
Oh, 'cause, honey, believe me
I'd sure love to call you my girlfriend

[Outro]
'Cause you got a good thing going, baby
You only need somebody to love
Oh, you got a good thing going
You're only looking for someone to love
'Cause you need to
Get back in the arms of a good friend
And I'm never gonna set you free
No, I'm never gonna set you free
