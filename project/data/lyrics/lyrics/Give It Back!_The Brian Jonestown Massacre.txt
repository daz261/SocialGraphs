Satellite
Flying high
Hello

Keep it cool
Break the rules
Beg for light
You know

Love flies above
While you're low

Evil eye
Teaches lies
Beg for light
It goes

Keep it cool
Break the rules
Know its time
To go

Love flies above
While you're low
Love flies above
C'mon let's go

Just passed
Satellite
Flying high
Hello

Keep it cool
Break the rules
Pray for light
Hello

Love flies above
Now you know
Love lives above
C'mon let's go
