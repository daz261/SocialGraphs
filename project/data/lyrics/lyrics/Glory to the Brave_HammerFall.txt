Icy water on my hands
The roar of thunder everywhere
I close my eyes
I realise I'm far away from home
In the twilight zone, the shadows mourn

Out of the night came the shining
The metal age

Ivory towers conceal my eyes
Caught up in a long lost time
When no-one speaks
At liberty, they guard their destiny
To forge the steel, they will reveal

Out of the night came the shining
The metal age

I'm falling into the breach
Well, I'm a stranger in this land
I'm falling

Standing strong, the brave and the elder
With scars seldom forgotten, above it all
Come with us, offering shelter
From the icy wind that shivers
Come with us to the twilight zone

You're welcome to the metal age

Hear the bell begins to chime
The moonlit skies burst out in flames
The time has come, it must be done
Let the power be unchained
By the force within, let the war begin

Out of the night came the shining
The metal age

 

Silent screaming
You're on your own
Balancing on a blade between
Whats right and what is wrong
Don't loose your faith, don't sit there in silence
Show your strength, let's hail the metal gods, bare your heart

All for one, our burning hearts will live forever
One for all, together standing strong

Hammerfall, we will prevail
Hammerfall, let us hail
Hammerfall, let us hail

We share a dream, the future is ours
A metal heart is hard to tear apart, heed the call
A flash of light calls out the providers
We run this race, but we will never crawl, all hail Hammerfall

All for one, our burning hearts will live forever
One for all, together standing strong

Hammerfall, we will prevail
Hammerfall, let us hail
Hammerfall, let us hail

Just follow your heart, don't listen to the crowd
The wisdom, the voice is calling from inside
The time long forgotten will soon come again
Prepare for the meeting, the gods of metal reign
