You paint a tulip red with joy
You say the psalm, I will not fear
Somehow, knowing what you do know
Still you tremble out and in

You cry up in your room
Aunt Ruthie comes, you cannot still your limbs
Somehow knowing what you do know
Still you tremble out and in

You see how I go to pieces
That I'm laying on the ground
Like the sky is so heavy
When I could be brave

And I always go to pieces
And I have it in my mind
That the sky is tall and heavy
When I could be brave, brave

You go outside, you see the Holy Spirit
Burning in your trees
And walk on, glowing with the same glow
Still you tremble out and in

And the birds of all your yellow teacups sing
And you know this hymn
Somehow knowing what you do know
Still you tremble out and in

See how I go to pieces
That I'm laying on the ground
That the sky is so heavy
When I could be brave, brave

Oh I know it, I know it, here is God beside
I meant it, I meant I'm sure of that
But the sky is tall and heavy
When I could be brave, brave
Brave
