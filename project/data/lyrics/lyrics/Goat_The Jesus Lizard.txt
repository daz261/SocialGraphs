So since the surgery
How's that ghost limb?
Hey, man, say, man, have you
Been rubbin' your nub?

Por favor
No sacar las manos
No sacar las manos
Fuera de la ventana
En tu cuenta, es mucho dinero
Lo siento

But I have got to hand it to you
You're taking this extremely well
Yeah, rub it on me
Rub it on me, Duane

So since the surgery
How's that ghost limb?
Hey, man, say, man, have you
Been rubbin' your nub?

 

He's gone in her lips, a glow from her lip
Ignites the shapes she sees in the shade
Only a little is used to come to a close
Only a little is used to come to a close

Tonight at the knife stick up place
I spoke as a child and choked on that line
Then I saw them, then I saw them
Then I saw them, then I saw them

What are they doing outside?
What are they doing?
What the hell are they doing outside?
What are they doing?

In so much brown and crap
It's set in an odd light
This one it stops right here now
I think it's trouble you invite

In so much as they
Don't know what's right
This one it stops right here now
I think it's trouble that you invite

An absurd gag, a monkey trick
An Irish bull, a childish joke
Ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow
Ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow

Tonight at the knife stick up place
I spoke as a child and choked on that line
Then I saw the, then I saw them
Then I saw them, then I saw them

I know they have them down there
I've seen them down there
Body parts all over this town
What are they doing?
