The dragon rises before me
I'll fornicate the beast
Come to me
Possess me as I burn
Into your painted realms

Come raging chaos
Rule power from your soul
Pure demoniac blessing
As I kill myself in woe
As I kill myself in woe

As souls coloured the face of the moon
Shall suffer the eclipse

You must know that I can no longer see
The difference of dream and reality

For the walls have been sieged
And banished by our dark satanic blasphemy
