Jenny sits all alone and she waits for the one
With a handful of charm she will bring back the sun
She's been waiting inside of her house at the end of the world
End of the world

She sees visions of futures, but not of her own
And she cries when she thinks of her empty home
She's been waiting inside of her house at the end of the world
End of the world, end of the world

Jenny sits and she hopes for a knock at her door
For a savior, a king or someone to adore
She's been waiting inside of her house at the end of the world

She sees visions of futures, but not of her own
And she cries when she thinks of her empty home
She's been waiting inside of her house at the end of the world
End of the world, end of the world

How will you ever see the end to this if you never leave
This little house you hide inside, this little house that you keep?
You say you'll never feign a distance from this place on the hill
You know it makes you cry and covers you, the things that you will
How will you ever meet the one who could bring back the sun?
You live inside yourself and now this house is the only one
You live inside yourself and now this house is the only one
(repeat)

 

Listen to me, everything will work out fine
There's a time in your life when you're losing your mind
Just come with me something different this time

I don't want to know where you intend to go
Everything changes, but nothing is stronger than love

Listen to me, everybody wins some day
And in time you will find every dog has his day
Nothing should matter or stand in your way

I don't want to know where you intend to go
Everything changes, but nothing is stronger than love

Everything changes, but nothing is stronger than love
