[Verse 1]
Where is the love where is this love
Where is the love that everyone is talking of
Where is the love where is the love
That everyone is dreaming of

[Verse 2]
Come to bed come to bed
Come to bed I cannot sleep in all this heat
Come to bed come to bed
This terror's all within my head

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't be deceived, no land in sight
We're all adrift in this dark night
We float on seas of disbelief
While singing songs of pain relief

[Chorus]
Shake my body - release my soul
Punish my senses - lose control
This body's young but my spirit's old
Scatter my ashes and let these feelings grow

[Verse 1]
Where is the love where is this love
Where is the love that everyone is talking of
Where is the love where is the love
That everyone is dreaming of

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't be deceived, no land in sight
We're all adrift in this dark night
We float on seas of disbelief
While singing songs of pain relief

[Chorus]
Shake my body - release my soul
Punish my senses - lose control
This body's young but my spirit's old
Scatter my ashes and let these feelings grow

[Bridge]

[Outro]
Shake my body - release my soul
Punish my senses - lose control
Shake my body - release my soul
Punish my senses - lose control
Shake my body - release my soul
Punish my senses - lose control
Shake my body - release my soul
Punish my senses - lose control
Shake my body - release my soul
Punish my senses - lose control

 

You may say I am cynical, but I say man is flawed
He has a vague memory of before some fall
Behaving like a reptile, but talks of walking tall
If god is in his image, the almighty must be small

God only knows

Swaggart has been caught with his trousers round his knees
After damning me and you to hell for eternity
Sex and power and money is the prayer of these priests
They bribe their way past heaven's gates and steal a set of keys

God only knows

My guru has been sleeping with adepts and with sheep
While I was fucking celibate, self-righteous in belief
Yesterday he was god, now he is a creep
We fell upon each other starving for belief

God only knows

I speak in the name of god
I speak in the name of that
White haired old man in the clouds
Always a man
Dispensing lightening justice from his fingertips
Watching you every second of the day
Just waiting for you to fuck up
I speak in the name of God
I'm his intermediary
I'm a Mollah, I'm a Priest, I'm a Vicar
If you want to go to God
You have to come through me

Is heaven full, oh lord, of these babbling preachers and
God-fearing biggots
All these sef-rightious, self-appointed prophets
Because if so:-
I know where I'd rather be
Away from this cacophony
Away from this cacophony
God only knows
God only knows
God only knows

 

Oh it's late it's late it's late show
Oh it's late it's a late it's a late show

I'm afraid of loneliness swallowing me
I'm afraid of loneliness swallowing me
Swallowing me

Bow down, bow down with someone
Bow down, bow down with somewhere
It's It's It's better than me
It's It's It's better than me

I'm afraid of loneliness swallowing me
I'm afraid of loneliness swallowing me
Swallowing me

Bow down, bow down with somewhere
Bow down, bow down with someone
It's It's It's better than me
It's It's It's better than me

Oh, it's a late show
It's it's it's a late show

I'm afraid of loneliness swallowing me
I'm afraid of loneliness swallowing me

Hula-hey-ray, hula-hey-rey
Hula-hey-ray, hula-hey-rey
Hula-hey-ray, hula-hey-rey
Hula-hey-ray

Are you swallowing me?
Are you swallowing me?
Are you swallowing me?
Are you swallowing me?

Swallowing me
Swallowing me
Swallowing me
Swallowing me
