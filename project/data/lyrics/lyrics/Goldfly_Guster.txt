[Verse 1: Ryan Miller]
Played follow the leader
Keeping my steps in time
Counting on the wonder ahead
I leave the pain behind

[Hook: Ryan Miller & Adam Gardner]
It's on me
It's all mine
Go away
They're my mistakes
They're not your problem

[Verse 2: Ryan Miller]
Pinned down in this heaven
I'll die a thousand times
Aware of the damage ahead
I'll leave the pain behind

[Chorus: Ryan Miller]
Another day
A perfect day
A twinge of pain
The sting of a needle
When staring at
The walls provide
A brilliant sight
Through eyes of a needle

[Verse 3: Ryan Miller]
So warm at the bottom
Warm never felt so kind
And for a moment or two
I leave it all behind

[Hook: Ryan Miller & Adam Gardner]
It's on me
It's all mine
Go away
They're my mistakes
They're not your problem

[Bridge: Ryan MIller]
Black dog
White picket fences
Mow them down and dance in the riptide
Face down in consequences
Crack me up
And stay on your own side

[Chorus: Ryan Miller]
Another day
A perfect day
A twinge of pain
The sting of a needle
When starin at
The walls provide
A brilliant sight
Through eyes of a needle

[Outro: Ryan Miller]
I wish I may
I wish I might
I pray my soul
To keep tonight
When all the walls
Stop staring back
A perfect day
A sting for the last time
