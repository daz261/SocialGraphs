Oh
To be
Not
Anyone
Gone
This maze
Of being
Skin
Oh to cry
Not any cry
So mournful
That
The dove
Just laughs
And
The steadfast
Gasps
Oh to owe
Not anyone
Nothing
To be
Not here
But here
Forsaking
Equatorial bliss
Who walked
Through
The callow mist
Dressed in scraps
Who walked
The curve
Of the world
Whose bone
Scraped
Whose flesh
Unfurled
Who grieves
Not
Anyone gone
To greet lame
The inspired sky
Amazed to stumble
Where gods
Get lost
Beneath
The southern
Cross

 

[Verse 1]
Toward another he has gone
To breathe an air beyond his own
Toward a wisdom beyond the shelf
Toward a dream that dreams itself

[Chorus]
About a boy beyond it all
About a boy beyond it all

[Verse 2]
From the forest from the foam
From the field that he had known
Toward a river twice as blessed
Toward the inn of happiness

[Chorus]
About a boy beyond it all
About a boy beyond it all

[Verse 3]
From a chaos raging sweet
From the deep and dismal street
Toward another kind of peace
Toward the great emptiness

[Chorus]
About a boy beyond it all
About a boy beyond it all

[Outro]
I stood among them I listened
I stood among them I listened not
I stood among them and I heard myself
Who I've loved better than you
So much so that I walked on
Into the face of God
Away from your world
And my sour stomach
Into the face of God, who said
Boy, I knew thee not, but boy
Now that I have you in my face
I embrace you. I welcome you
He was just a boy
Whirling in the snow
Just a little boy
Who would never grow
