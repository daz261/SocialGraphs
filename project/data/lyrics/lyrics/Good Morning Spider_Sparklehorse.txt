Supposed to come a rain but it's not

Oh yeah

Oh yeah
Here come the painbirds

Spiral down those hateful dears
Between our skins and burning spheres

Oh yeah
Here come the painbirds
Oh yeah
Here come the painbirds

Goddamn it's so very hot/spiral down those hateful dears
Supposed to come a rain but it's not/between our skins and burning spheres

Oh yeah
Here come the painbirds
Oh yeah
Here come the painbirds
Oh yeah
Here come the painbirds
