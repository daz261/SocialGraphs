To every young man who can pass
From every lipstick lezzie-lez
And every drag queen's high heeled stagger
To every bulldagger swagger
Do the bulldagger bulldagger swagger 3x
Yeah

I went to charm school
I got a degree
In full-fledged femininity
No now, I'm not tryin' to be a man
I'm just a bein' who I am
And that's a very very very butch lesbian

Do the bulldagger bulldagger swagger 3x
Yeah
Uh-huh

I went to the ladies room I had to pee
Why was everybody starrin' at me?
A little girl giggled
A lady gasped
One woman almost had a heart attack

She started doing the bulldagger bulldagger swagger
Do the bulldagger bulldagger swagger 2x
Yeah yeah

To every young man who can pass
From every lipstick lezzie-lez
And every drag queen's high heeled stagger
To every bulldagger swagger
Do the bulldagger bulldagger swagger 3x
Yeah
Uh-huh
Oh-yeah
