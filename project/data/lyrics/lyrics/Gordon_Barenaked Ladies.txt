(The silence, the terror, the pain, the horror
As your mom comes downstairs)

[Intro]
Enid, we never really knew each other anyway
Enid, we never really knew each other anyway

[Bridge]
It took me a year to believe it was over
And it took me two more to get over the loss
I took a beating when you wrote me those letters
And every time I remembered the taste of your lip gloss

[Chorus]
Enid, we never really knew each other anyway
Enid, we never really knew each other anyway
Maybe we always saw right through each other anyway
But Enid, we never really knew each other anyway

[Verse 1]
There were times when I wanted to hurt you
And there were times when I know that I did (Whoa-oh)
There were times when I thought I would kill you
But can you blame me? I was only a kid

Now, tell me why we never really respected each other
And tell me why I never believed
That you were a person too
I always thought that you fancied my brother
I may not have liked it, oh but
Memory is a strange thing, oh, and Enid?
Enid, I remember you

[Chorus]
Enid, we never really knew each other anyway
Enid, we never really knew each other anyway
Maybe we always saw right through each other anyway
But Enid, we never really knew each other anyway

[Bridge]
It took me a year to believe it was over
And it took me two more to get over the loss
I took a beating when you wrote me those letters
And every time you told me to get lost

[Verse 2]
Now it's not fair to say that it's 'cause
I was three inches shorter then
And it's not fair to say that it's 'cause
I was only fifteen years old
But maybe it's fair to say that it was a lack of communication
I took a phone message, oh and speaking of communication
Oh, and Enid?
Enid you got a cold

[Bridge]
I can get a job I can pay the phone bills
I can cut the lawn, cut my hair, cut out my cholesterol
I can work overtime, I can work in a mine
I can do it all for you
But I don't want to

[Chorus]
Enid, we never really knew each other anyway
Enid, we never really knew each other anyway
Maybe we always saw right through each other anyway
But Enid, we never really knew each other anyway

[Outro]
I can teach you how to dance, how to sing, how to knit
How to make things that you never ever made before
Enid, I can teach you how to use cookie cutters
To make crazy things out of Play-Doh

Little houses, little farms, little accessories for your mom
For your Barbie set, for your friends and your family
Enid, I can teach you how to snowmobile, cross-country ski, snowshoe
But I don't want to!

[Chorus]

 

[Verse 1]
I found my locker and I found my classes
I lost my lunch and I broke my glasses
That guy is huge! That girl is wailin'!
First day of school and I'm already failing

[Chorus]
This is me in grade nine, baby
This is me in grade nine (This is me in grade nine)
This is me in grade nine, baby
This is me in grade nine

[Verse 2]
I've got a blue-and-red Adidas bag and a humongous binder
I'm trying my best not to look like a minor niner
I went out for the football team to prove that I'm a man
I guess I shouldn't tell them that I like Duran Duran

[Chorus]
This is me in grade nine, baby
This is me in grade nine (This is me in grade nine)
This is me in grade nine, baby
This is me in grade nine

[Verse 3]
Well, half my friends are crazy and the others are depressed
And none of them can help me study for my math test
I got into the classroom and my knowledge was gone
Guess I should've studied instead of watching Wrath of Khan

[Chorus]
This is me in grade nine, baby
This is me in grade nine (This is me in grade nine)
This is me in grade nine, baby
This is me in grade nine

[Bridge]
They called me chicken legs!
They called me four-eyes!
They called me fatso!
They called me Buckwheat!
They called me Eddie

[Chorus]
This is me in grade nine, baby
Yeah, this is me in grade nine (This is me in grade nine)
This is me in grade nine, baby
This is me in grade nine

[Verse 4]
I've got a red leather tie and a pair of rugger pants
I put them on and I went to the high school dance
But Dad said I have to be home by eleven
Aw man, I'm gonna miss "Stairway to Heaven"!

[Chorus]
This is me in grade nine, baby
This is me in grade nine (This is me in grade nine)
This is me in grade nine, baby
This is me in grade nine (Well, this is me)

This is me in grade nine, baby
Yeah, this is me in grade nine (This is me in grade nine)
This is me in grade nine, baby
This is me in grade nine
