Complimentary
Is an homage i won't pay
Mediocracy
Is the mantra of our time
Nihilism
Instability within
We won't be pacified
We brake to olive branch sick cow
Infallibility
Sardonic to the end
Delusionary expectancy
Of things you can't amend
Don't call me a patriarch
Don't honor my contempt
Intolerant intoxicant

Absordent
Deodorant
Stick that between your legs honey
Constant vigilance precludes
Your surprise
Roll out the barrel it's time to americanize
Rational thinking eludes you all the way
Preconceived notion the factionizing way
Constipation
Is a problem from within
So villainous we can't discuss
The quagmire we are in
Don't call me irrelevant
Don't supersize the lies
Mathematically schematically
Puzzlehead go to bed
