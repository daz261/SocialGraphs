I felt a little uneasy on easy street
Out of place and incomplete call it guilt
Call it what you will
Kissed good-bye the summer sky
Hollywood and Malibu tides
Through thick and thin you got a
Good friend in me
Just give me a beer and give me a bed
Chase the demons out of my head
Play me a song and sing me to sleep
And meet me in the middle of my dreams

Well I’ve seen the sun rise from the cliffs at Point Reyes
And I’ve see it set upon Thunder Bay
But I always keep my compass set on you

When the night comes in and the stars come out
The highway lines start to wear me out
It’ll be ok cause I’m coming back home to you

And distant salutations and silly souvenirs
Can’t help your twilight loneliness
Or brush away your tears
I’ll wire you some love today
There’s so much more I want to say

But I’m Western Union desperate
In a pay phone in the rain
And it’s so insane
I’m Rimbaud and you’re Verlaine

So hey! California here I come
I got my old backpack and a sunburnt thumb
I hope my compass is tried and ture
Cause when I need a friend it’s still you
