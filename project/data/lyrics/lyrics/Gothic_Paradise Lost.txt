[Verse 1]
Stare at the dark foreboding walls
I turn and look away
The fear, it haunts me
While I sleep
(Sleep)

[Verse 2]
Now as life is torn apart
The walls, they lead the way
This tortured journey
Almost at the end
(At the end)

[Verse 3]
Look at time upon the skies
I turn and look away
The truth, it haunts me
Wake me from sleep
(Sleep)
