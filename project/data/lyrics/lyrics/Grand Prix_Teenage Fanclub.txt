It gives me pain when I think of you
And the things together that we'll never do
At first it's cold, and then it's hot
Tried to be someone that I know I'm not

I'm in trouble and I know it
How I'm feeling, I can't show it
But these feelings don't go away

I remember you, lines on your face
Sharing a moment in the perfect place
I'm deep in your eyes and inside your head
And I try to reach you when I'm in my bed

In trouble, I know it
How I'm feeling, I can't show it
But these feelings don't go away

There is no choice in what I must do
Nothing is greater than to be with you

I'm in trouble, I know it
How I'm feeling, I can't show it
These feelings don't go away
