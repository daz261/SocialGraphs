Passers by coincide with me
Steppin' out to cross my line
Feelin' sick - feel like shit
But I always say I'm fine

One stab in the back after another
I've had it up to my ears
One well aimed kick in their rear
And then I'm outta here

Are you ready - I've been ready
All my life all along
You bet I'm ready

Day by day night by nightmare
I've got my ass on the line
I've gotta get down get on out
Before I'm goin'blind

Are you ready - I'm ready
Won't you come along
Bet your ass I'm ready
Gotta move right out of here
