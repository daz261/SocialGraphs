[Verse 1]
Call you up in the middle of the night
Like a firefly without a light
You were there like a blowtorch burning
I was a key that could use a little turning

So tired that I couldn't even sleep
So many secrets I couldn't keep
Promised myself I wouldn't weep
One more promise I couldn't keep

[Pre-Chrous 1]
It seems no one can help me now
I'm in too deep
There's no way out
This time I have really led myself astray

[Chorus]
Runaway train never going back
Wrong way on a one-way track
Seems like I should be getting somewhere
Somehow I'm neither here nor there

[Verse 2]
Can you help me remember how to smile?
Make it somehow all seem worthwhile
How on earth did I get so jaded?
Life's mystery seems so faded

I can go where no one else can go
I know what no one else knows
Here I am, just drowning in the rain
With a ticket for a runaway train

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And everything seems cut and dry
Day and night
Earth and sky
Somehow I just don't believe it

[Chorus]
Runaway train never going back
Wrong way on a one-way track
Seems like I should be getting somewhere
Somehow I'm neither here nor there

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
Bought a ticket for a runaway train
Like a madman laughing at the rain
A little out of touch, a little insane
It's just easier than dealing with the pain

[Chorus]
Runaway train never going back
Wrong way on a one-way track
Seems like I should be getting somewhere
Somehow I'm neither here nor there

[Outro]
Runaway train never coming back
Runaway train tearing up the track
Runaway train burning in my veins
Runaway but it always seems the same
