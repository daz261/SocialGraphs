Everybody go 'round, go 'round, go 'round
Everybody lay down, lay down, lay down
Don't nobody make a sound
Everybody lay down

Everybody give up, give up, give up
Nobody hang tough, hang tough, hang tough
Life a little too rough
Everybody lay down

Everybody say hey, don't nobody say no
Everybody say wait, don't nobody say go
Everybody lay down

Everybody cry loud, cry loud, cry loud
Nobody too proud, too proud, too proud
To tell you what they're all about
Everybody lay down

Everybody don't care, don't care, don't care
Nobody play fair, play fair, play fair
Maybe everybody too scared
Everybody lay down

Everybody say hey, don't nobody say no
Everybody say wait, don't nobody say go
Everybody lay down

Everybody look higher
Everybody wanna touch the fire
Nobody willing to lay it all down

Everybody want heaven
Everybody say amen
One thing is certain
You gotta lay it all down

Everybody say hey, don't nobody say no
Everybody say wait, don't nobody say go
Everybody lay down
