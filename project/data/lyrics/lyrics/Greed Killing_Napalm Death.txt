[Verse 1]
Played out, wide off the mark
Mania develops
Akin to fiction
More than to a world of fact

[Chorus]
My own worst enemy
My own worst enemy
Lifes foul treachery
My own worst enemy

[Verse 2]
Dams of emotions build
A dull and turbid screen
Clouding veils of black
In jungles of hopes oppressed

[Chorus]
My own worst enemy
My own worst enemy
Lifes foul treachery
My own worst enemy

[Bridge]
So many times
For no reason
So many promised punches
For what reason?

Ceaseless decay
Parallel obscene and flagrant
Ceaseless decay
Restrained my mind coils

So many times
For no reason
So many promised punches
For what reason?

Ceaseless decay
Parallel obscene and flagrant
Ceaseless decay
Restrained my mind coils

[Verse 1]
Played out, wide off the mark
Mania develops
Akin to fiction
More than to a world of fact

[Chorus]
My own worst enemy
My own worst enemy
Life foul treachery

 

Decay, melting wits
It thinks to true control
Can't see you're recognized the pain
Expression sealed decay melting wits
That's it you're recognized the pain
Can't see your recognize the pain

Darkly quit makes to spat new poll spray the stench
No rules for tender mercy is take the plunge and fail
Aftermath don't feeling got no way on through burden
Aftermath on feeling or no way on through burden
Self betrayal

Decay melting wits
It thinks to true control
Can't see you're recognize the pain
Can't see you're recognized the pain
