Forced open eyes, i felt the heat cling to me
Felt the air pass through me
Rode an engine that was wearing down
From bearing me between the nether ends of questions
Past my half-learned lessons
While i faked a joyful sound
Chrysalis, always waiting, wasting time
Debating action, feeling smart
And pushing to be pulled apart
You know this road so well
Can't tell me where it leads
Fifty miles of extremes, from contact to withdrawal
That engine's slowing to a crawl
Doubtful of a coming change
That turns half into a whole
Without feeling pain at all
You know this road so well
Can't tell me
Where it leads...
It's only in-between

 

Deny responsibility
You make yourself into a tool
But the forge is never called into question
The eye beholds the reward
You need to be adored
You're the finish so you'd better look good;
From day one this has been your lesson
If this is all you need to be
Your conscience is a liability
Do you ever doubt this was meant to be?
You shine
This kind of polish can be very expensive
But soul is unknown
To tools and chrome
