What up ya
Give it to me go

Can't make me, can't break me
And now you know you're the one
Can't fake it, can't take it
And now you know you're the one

Can't make me
And now you know you're the one
Can't break me
And now your name's number one
Can't make me
And now you know you're the one
Gonna take you out

Boom Boom Boom Boom
There goes another one
Boom Boom Boom Boom
There goes another one
Boom Boom Boom Boom
There goes another one
Boom Boom Boom Boom
There goes another one

I haven't gotten to it quite yet
But you deserve all that you'll get
Like Santa Claus, but with a twist
Your name goes to the top of the list
Boom Boom Boom Boom

What up like that
Yea
Do it to it, yea

Can't top me, can't stop me
And now you know you're the one
Can't lop me, can't drop me
And now you know you're the one

Can't top me
And now you know you're the one
Can't stop me
And now your name's number one
Can't top me
And now you know you're the one
Gonna take you out

Boom Boom Boom Boom
There goes another one
Boom Boom Boom Boom
There goes another one
Boom Boom Boom Boom
There goes another one
Boom Boom Boom Boom
There goes another one

Some people still will make a house call
Could be business or just personal
I don't congratulate you for your rise
Just eliminate those I despise
Boom Boom Boom Boom

Give it to me go

Throw it down, yea

Give it up again
