For registraition
So get your gold card
And make me happy
I lost my brother
He was a good man
I'm sure the others
Will throw the ball in

You tried to stop them
But they kept going
Penalty victim
For boundary throw in
Don't bother me cos
I never smoke that
I'm sure the others
Had an abortion

You got a trademark for registraition
So get your gold card
And lets be happy
I love the others
I'm contradicted
You said it's over
But i won't listen
