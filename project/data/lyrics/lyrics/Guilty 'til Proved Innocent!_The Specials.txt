How can you be so horrible?
The things you say are terrible
You make me feel ashamed
When you call me names

How come you think it's wise
To tell those wicked lies
You play such silly games
When you call me names

Stones and sticks don't hurt like bricks
No skin off my nose
I'll take the flack and hand it back
It's just the way that it goes
You dish the dirt but names don't hurt
You never break my bones
I'll grit my teeth but underneath
It' only sticks and stones

You think you win a prize
To cut me down to size
You make outrageous claims
When you call me names

Stones and sticks don't hurt like bricks
No skin off my nose
I'll take the flack and hand it back
It's just the way that it goes
You dish the dirt but names don't hurt
You never break my bones
I'll grit my teeth but underneath
It' only sticks and stones

How can you say those things
When they aim to sting
It always sounds the same
When you call me names

Stones and sticks don't hurt like bricks
No skin off my nose
I'll take the flack and hand it back
It's just the way that it goes
You dish the dirt but names don't hurt
You never break my bones
I'll grit my teeth but underneath
It' only sticks and stones

You never say what you mean
You never mean what you say
You never say what you mean
You never mean what you say
You never say what you mean
When you call me names
When you call me names
When you call me names
When you call me names

 

Come let me tell you about the shotguns of Hillfields
Let me tell you about the stenguns of Knightsbridge
Let me tell you about the Moss Side barretta
Let me tell you about the windows of my house

I'm not afraid of being afraid, I'm only fearful
I'm not afraid of being afraid, I'm only fearful

Let me tell you about the bombs in the Arndale
Let me tell you about the Welling election
Let me tell you about the black church burning
Let me tell you about the bat by my front door

I'm not afraid of being afraid, I'm only fearful
I'm not afraid of being afraid, I'm only fearful

Don't talk to strangers
Bolt your front door, don't make eye contact
Buy a crook lock, wear your flak vest to the supermarket

It makes me shudder when I read the newspaper
Have a career, learn to breed paranoia
Me keep a watching on the rear view mirror
Me no tell you where I keep my revolver

Come let me tell you about the security systems
Let me tell you about the video surveillance
Let me tell you about my new rotweiller
Welcome to the siege mentality

I'm not afraid of being afraid, I'm only fearful
I'm not afraid of being afraid, I'm only fearful
I'm not afraid of being afraid, I'm only fearful
I'm not afraid of being afraid, I'm only fearful
Fearful, fearful, fearful
