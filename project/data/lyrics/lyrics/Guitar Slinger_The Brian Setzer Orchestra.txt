You say you love me baby
Well this ain't no lost and found
I've got just one deal to make then I'll be trouble bound
They say that you're a doll, that with you I'll keep on winnin'
I think they're talkin' 'bout the kind of doll that you stick pins in

You're my Hoodoo Voodoo Doll
You're my Hoodoo Voodoo Doll
If you keep on sinnin', I'll stick another pin in
You're my Hoodoo Voodoo Doll

I asked the fortune teller where my love might be
She gazed into her crystal ball then looked straight up at me
I told her when your eyes met mine you cast an evil spell
I made a deal with the devil man, my soul to him I'd sell

You're my Hoodoo Voodoo Doll
You're my Hoodoo Voodoo Doll
If you keep on sinnin', I'll just stick another pin in
You're my Hoodoo Voodoo Doll

Got your gris-gris and your mojo, but it won't work on me
Now you're mixin' up some love potion #3
Got my deal signed in blood and there ain't no turnin' back
Cost me all of my money and my pink Cadillac

You're my Hoodoo Voodoo Doll
You're my Hoodoo Voodoo Doll
If you keep on sinnin', I'll stick another pin in
You're my Hoodoo Voodoo Doll

 

When you're young and so in love as we
And bewildered by the world we see
Why do people hurt us so
Only those in love would know
What a town without pity can do

If we stop to gaze upon a star
People talk about how bad we are
Ours is not an easy age
We're like tigers in a cage
What a town without pity can do

The young have problems, many problems
We need an understanding heart
Why don't they help us, try to help us
Before this clay and granite planet falls apart

Take these eager lips and hold me fast
I'm afraid this kind of joy can't last
How can we keep love alive
How can anything survive
When these little minds tear you in two
What a town without pity can do

How can we keep love alive
How can anything survive
When these little minds tear you in two
What a town without pity can do

No, it isn't very pretty
What a town without pity can do
