6, 6, 6 am on the weekend
She's creeping out of the East End
And he said it was nothing
Just slipped and missed her ride from the girlfriends

And hey Jenny
Your hair looks crazy messy
Did you all nod off with your shoes on?
Did you fuck and fall asleep on the futon?

I can't believe you were crashed out watching some movies

"Wake up, lil floozy
Jenny looks a little jonesy"
She said, "I don't quite know what happened
Woke up with my dress wide open

And I like the lights, and I like 'em pretty bright
(And he pulled out a pipe in the taxi)
And I like the lights, and I like 'em pretty bright
(And he took off my tights in the taxi)

And I like the lights, and I like 'em pretty bright
(And he pulled out a pipe in the taxi)
And I like the lights, and I like 'em pretty bright
(And he took off my tights in the taxi)"
