[Verse 1]
Yeah, I made a promise to love myself
But somehow I don't think that I'm gonna make it

Yeah, is that me behind the screen?
I see some shapes, but I can't see any faces

[Chorus]
An ego might not be so bad
It could be something I should have
I can't make my mind up
Help me with this while I grip this
I made a promise to myself, but I think I need some help
If you see something that is good in me won't you tell me?
And maybe I'd be something you could stand

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I made a promise to love myself
I think this could be good for you as well as me

Yeah, I know I'm not that much fun
The joke I have become doesn't make you laugh

[Chorus]

Yeah!

[Bridge]
Here comes the doubt again (x3)
Here comes the doubt
Here comes the doubt again (x3)
Here comes the doubt
Here comes the doubt (x4)

[Chorus](x2)
