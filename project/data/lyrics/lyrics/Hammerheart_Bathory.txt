Mother winter leaves our land
And opens wide the seas
The lukewarm breeze doth beckon me
As it whispers through the trees

It says: Set your sails
And let me take your ship to foreign shores
Take farewell of those near you
And your land of the North!

The wild cold deep black ocean's waves
Invites my hungry heart
Cry not my love I'll return
Only death can keep us apart

Odin in the sky up high
Let the Ravens of yours fly
To guide us on our sail to foreign shores
Let your Ravens fly

The wind blows through my hair
And fills our sails with hope and pride
Caress these lines of Oak, wind
Do not throw us all aside

The wild cold deep black ocean's waves
As wide as sky above
Carry us, oh, Gods of sea
Don't take us down below

Now approach the shore at dawn
All is still the light of daybreak is yet to be born
Clad in morning dew asleep
The city's walls rise before us men from the seas

Carrying cold steel at our sides
No time to lose at sunbirth we attack the city by surprise
Down the coastlines with the wind we reign
Men of the North we leave the shores in flames

Shores in Flames
Shores in Flames
Shores in Flames
Shores in Flames

Fire!

[Guitar Solo - Quorthon]

Thor of thunder way up high
Swing your Hammer that cracks the sky
Send the wind to fill our sails and take us home
Guide your sons, us, home

When the wind cries out my name
And time has come for me to die
Then wrap me in my cape
And lay my sword down at my side

Then place me on a ship of Oak
And let it drift with tide
Let the flames purify my soul
On its way to hall up high

Up high
Up high
Up high
Up high

Fire!

 

Out of the water
The cold black Nordic sea
Risen towards the eternal sky
The land lays open and free

Up high the Mountains
Where the wind catch its speed and chill
Snowstorms are born
And rage loud through the valleys and the hills

Above two Ravens
Messengers of the wise One eyed God
Who rules this land
Of the strong and the great

And tall
Beautiful
Behold this thy land
Open and free
This thy home of the brave

Dark endless forest
Where at the day hides the shadows of the night
Snowcovered vast lands
As great as the eternal sky

Now in the midst
Of this wild and this open and free
He placed my kind
To possess this their land to be

Above two Ravens
Messengers of the wise one eyed God
Who ruled this land
Of once strong and once great

But now
Forgetting to behold this their land
Once ours (once) free
This my home of once brave

[Guitar Solo - Quorthon]

 

One man rode the way through the woods
Down to Asa Bay
Where dragon ships had sailed to sea
More times than one could say

To see with own eyes the wonder
People told, from man to man
The God of all almightiness
Had arrived from a foreign land

The rumors told of a man
Who had come from the other side the seas
Carrying gold cross around neck in chain
And spoke in strange tongue of peace

He had come with strange men in armor
Dressed in purple shirts and lace
Smelling not of beer but flowers
And with no hair in face

And the bold man carrying cross
Had told all one of Asa Bay
The God of all man, woman, child had come
To them all save

And to thank Lord of Heaven
One should build to God a house
And to save one's soul from Hell
One should be baptized and say vows

A man of pride with the hammer told new God
To build his house on own
And spoke loud of the Gods of their fathers
Not too long time gone

The rumors said the man with a beard like fire
And the hammer in chain
By men in armor silenced was and by
Their swords was slain

Those who did not pay the one coin
Of four to man of new God
Whipped was twenty and put in chains then locked
By their neck to the log
(...to the log)

And so all of Asa Bay did build
A house of the cross
Every hour of daylight they did sweat
Limbs ached because faith does cost

[Guitar Solo - Quorthon]

And on the day two hundred
There it stood white to the sky
The house of the God of the cross
Big enough to take two dragon ships inside

And all of Asa Bay did watch
The wonder raise to the sky
Now must the God of the cross be pleased
And satisfied

Just outside the circle of the crowd
One old man did stand
He looked across the waters
And blotted the sun out of his eyes with one hand

And his old eyes could almost see
The dragon ships set sail
And his old ears could almost hear
Men of great numbers call out Oden's hail

And though he did know already
Though he turned face towards sky
And whispered silent words forgotten
Spoken only way up high

Now this house of a foreign God does stand
Now must they leave us alone
Still he heard from somewhere in the woods
Old crow of wisdom say
"People of Asa land, it's only just begun"
