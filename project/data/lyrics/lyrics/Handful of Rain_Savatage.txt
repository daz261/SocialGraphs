The night is growing dark
From somewhere deep within
It shelters like an ark
That always takes you in
And the mind goes numb
Until it's feeling no pain
And the soul cries out
For a handful of rain

Wash your women
In your whiskey
When your future's
In the past
And you're staring
Up at heaven
From the bottom
Of a glass
And you need some insulation
From the years you've had and lost
And you feel the perspiration
As you're adding up the cost

And the night rolls on
Like a slow moving train
And the soul cries out

There's a land beyond the living
There's a land beyond the dead
If it's true that God's forgiving
Of the lives that we had led
In the distance there's a thunder
And the air is thick and warm
And the patrons watch with wonder
The approaching of the storm

And the night rolls on
Like a slow moving train
And the soul cries out
For a handful of rain

There's an old man in the corner
And he's smoking all the time
And the smoke is drifting upward and it's
Twisting in my
Twisting in my mind

My mind

The whiskey's getting deeper
And I use it like a moat
There's a blues man in the distance and he's
Lost inside his note

His note
His note

The night is growing dark
From somewhere deep within
It shelters like an ark
That always takes you in
And the night rolls on
Like a slow moving train
And the soul cries out
For a handful of rain

 

He was standing all alone
Trying to find the words to say
When every prayer he ever prayed
Was gone
And the dreams he's never owned
Are still safely tucked away
Until tomorrow he just
Carries on

See the Devil in the streets at night
See him running in the pouring rain
See him grinning neath a twisted light
I'll be back again
See the people standing in a row
See them nodding like a field of grain
No one sees the sickle though
Coming cross the plain

And this he knows if nothing more
That waiting in the dark like destiny
Are those who kissed the dogs of war
And there is no tomorrow
No tomorrow
Take a chance
Take a chance

See the Devil he is so intense
See the Devil go and change his name
What's the going price of innocence
It can't be the same
Is it dark when the moon is down
Is it dark with a single flame
If there's glass falling all all around
I am not to blame

And this he knows if nothing more
That waiting in the dark like destiny
Are those who kissed the dogs of war
And there is no tomorrow
No tomorrow
Take a chance

Burn the night away

Pictures at an exhibition
Played as he stood in his trance
Staring at his inhibitions
All the time believing
That it now came down to
Nothing but this chance

I fear you
Your silence
Your blindness
See what you want to see
In darkness
One kindness
One moment
Tell me what you believe

I believe in nothing
Never really had to
In regards to your life
Rumors that are not true
Who's defending evil
Surely never I
Who would be the witness
Should you chance to die

Father can you hear me
This is not how it was meant to be
I am safe and so are you
As for the others destiny
I believe that situations
All depend on circumstance
Look away
Look away

Pictures at an exhibition
Played as he stood in his trance
Staring at his inhibitions
All the time believing
That it now came down to
Nothing but this chance
