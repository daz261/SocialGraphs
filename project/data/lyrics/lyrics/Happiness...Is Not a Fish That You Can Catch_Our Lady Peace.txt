We live, we die
I don't know the reasons we ask why
We hate, we push
Recent tests show we all are misunderstood, yeah

Come one, now, something's seizing
You know you lost your mind
You know we all need saving
She found you late last night
You feel the madness gaining
You know you just can't win
You know this, you know this, you know this
But I'm just so tired of waking up on the ground

I, well I never knew the girl
And I never knew the world hurt
I, I, and I
I, well I never knew the girl

We beg, we pray
But everything still happens anyway, yeah

Come on, now, something's teasing
Your conscience can't decide
She kept your will from caving
But left you paranoid
You feel the constant straining
She reappears divine
You noticed, you noticed, you noticed
But I'm just so tired of waking up all alone

I, well I never knew the girl
And I never knew the world hurt
I, I, and I
I, well I never knew the girl

I'm just so tired of waking up on the ground

I, well I never knew the girl
And I never knew the world hurt
I, I, and I
I, well I never knew the girl
And I never knew the world hurt
I, I, and I
