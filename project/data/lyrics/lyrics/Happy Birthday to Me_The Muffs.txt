Anytime, anyplace
Yeah it's nice to see your face
And it's true that I still want you
In the most obnoxious way

Honeymoon
Honeymoon
Honeymoon
Yeah

And I know what I feel
It'll do I do believe
And I know that it's your power
That'll be the end of me

(Repeat Chorus)
Going round and round the bend
I fear the end of me
Feeling like a twisted clown
I guess I'll wait and see

(Repeat Chorus)
