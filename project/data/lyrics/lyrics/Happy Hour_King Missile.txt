He makes the best fucking films (x2)
If I ever meet him I'm gonna grab his fuckin' neck
And just shake him
And say thank you thank you for makin'
Such excellent fuckin' movies

Then I'd twist his nose all the way the fuck around
And then rip off one of his ears and throw it
Like a like a like a fuckin' Frisbee

I wanna chew his fuckin' lips off
And grab his head and suck out one of his eyes
And chew on it and spit it out in his face
And say thank you thank you for all of your fuckin' films

Then I'd pick him up by the hair
Swing him over my head a few times
And throw him across the room
And kick all his fuckin' teeth in
And then stomp on his face 40 or 50 times

'Cause he makes the best fucking films
He makes the best fucking films
I've ever seen in my life
I fuckin' love him
I fuckin' love him
