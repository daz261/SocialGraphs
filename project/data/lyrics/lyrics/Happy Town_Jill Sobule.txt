I wake up every morning to the sound of birds
It's really not birds it's my neighbor's TV
She watches talk shows all day long
I used to hate her but now we get along

I used to sit under a gloomy cloud of gray
And now the sun is shining and it won't go away

I used to go up
I used to go down
Now I'm just even here in Happy Town
Happy Town

My boyfriend Bob he said I made him miserable
But we stayed together 'cause the sex was really good
And then he packed his bags with me to Happy Town
We don't fuck anymore, but we can really snuggle down

I used to sit under a gloomy cloud of gray
And now the sun is out and my whole world is beige

I used to go up
I used to go down
Now I'm just even here in Happy Town
I don't get excited
But nor do I frown
The lawn is always neat in Happy Town
Happy Town
Happy Town

To get to Happy Town you can call your doctor
You can unscrew the child-proof bottle cap
Pour yourself a glass of water

I used to sit under a gloomy cloud of gray
And now the sun is shining and it won't go away

I used to go up
I used to go down
Now I'm just even here in Happy Town
I don't get excited
Nor do I frown
The lawn is always neat in Happy Town
Happy Town
Happy Town

I used to go up
I used to go down
Now I'm just even here in Happy Town
I don't get excited
But nor do I frown
Life is just OK in Happy Town
Happy Town
Happy Tow

 

Another barren egg, another month gone by
Just more time to do as I please
No one watching over me
I don't have to make my bed I can lay in it instead
With no one there to bother me
'Cause I'm free it's just me

Another friend got caught
Another friend knocked up
Another friend with nothing in common with me
Another night with you
Spending time with you
I'm still alone 'cause you're the freest man I've ever
Known

I'm free just me
I'm free nobody but me
I'm free save me

Free as the snow as it melts away
Free as the wind on a real calm day
Free as the moth on my window pane
Like you like me

Another barren egg another year gone by
Just more time to do as I please
No one's tugging at my sleeve
I can be as rude as I please
No one's going to fire me
Floating in this endless sea

I'm free just me
I'm free nobody but me
I'm free save me
