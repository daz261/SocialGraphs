I've been riding around with the top down
Like I always do
My love at my side, but only this time
My friends say something's changed you
They said you're running with the wrong set
The girl is someone you should never have met
Let her go on her own, son
Everyone else has just come undone

The old town fathers are up in arms
The city council is very alarmed
Cousins and uncles are having fits
Predictors of doom think this is it
Everybody else is just hanging around
And me and my baby, we're the talk of the town

The statue there in the town square
Seems to stare at me
Walking around with my head down
They say can't we make you see
Said son, you know we're really color blind
But everybody else seems to really mind
Lose her now, I think you'll find
Everything else will just fall in line

The old town fathers are up in arms
The city council is very alarmed
Cousins and uncles are having fits
Predictors of doom think this is it
Everyone else is just thinking out loud
And me and my baby, we're the talk of the town

We're probably not the first
Surely not the last
Shouldn't throw stones out from your house of glass
Round here lots of crackers and cheese
Stay away from those my daddy said to me
You'll get in trouble if you mess with these

The old town fathers are up in arms
The city council is very alarmed
Cousins and uncles are having fits
Predictors of doom think this is it
Everybody else is just hanging around
And me and my baby, we're the talk of the town

 

Is he sane or insane
That's all they want to know
Is he crazy or strange
Then if so, I want to go
I've seen him leave at night
Followed him so far
Drove out about thirteen miles
Then he pulled in to a shothouse bar
For a ...

Long tall cool one
Don't know just what's going down
Long tall cool one
Looks like a new friend I've found

Walking in the shadows
Now I want back in the light
As I make the drop I've got some
Second thoughts tonight
You see I walked right in, sat right down
Offered him a light
Big talk for about thirteen hours
He said, can you help me with a job tonight
For a ...

Long tall cool one
Don't know just what's going down
Long tall cool one
He said something's in it for me right now
I've reached out into the darkness
Jumped up from my bed
Woke up in the middle of the night
Got myself in way over my head
For the ...

Long tall cool one
Don't know just what's going down
Long tall cool one
Looks like a new friend I've found
Long tall cool one
But it better never bite me well
Long tall cool one
Customer's always right ...
