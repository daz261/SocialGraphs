[Verse 1]
From Hank to Hendrix
I walked these streets with you
Here I am with this old guitar
Doing what I do
I always expected
That you would see me through
I never believed in much
But I believed in you

[Chorus]
Can we get it together
Can we still stand side by side
Can we make it last
Like a musical ride?

[Verse 2]
From Marilyn to Madonna
I always loved your smile
Now we're headed
For the big divorce
California-style
I found myself singing
Like a long-lost friend
The same thing that makes you live
Can kill you in the end

[Chorus]
Can we get it together
Can we still stand side by side
Can we make it last
Like a musical ride?

[Verse 3]
Sometimes it's distorted
Not clear to you
Sometimes the beauty of love
Just comes ringing through
New glass in the window
New leaf on the tree
New distance between us
You and me

[Chorus]
Can we get it together
Can we still walk side by side
Can we make it last
Like a musical ride?
