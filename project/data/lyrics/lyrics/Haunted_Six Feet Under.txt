[Verse 1]
I cut your throat, wide, opening a hole in your neck
Your blood sprays my skin warm and wet
You can't feel your heart beating
Scream, no one is listening
I cut your tongue from your mouth

[Chorus]
Dying you feel yourself slip away
Your dead body will be left, unburied
No one will find you dead

[Verse 2]
All is quiet as I force my fist down your cut throat
Grabing tendons and veins
I pull your insides out through your lipless mouth
Your stiff body is cold and still

[Chorus]
Dying you feel yourself slip away
Your dead body will be left, unburied
No one will find you dead

[Interlude]
Violent
Silence

[Chorus]
Dying you feel yourself slip away
Your dead body will be left, unburied
No one will find you dead

[Verse 3]
Haphazardly I remove your spleen and your liver
There is much blood
Eyes have been removed
While you were still alive
Now I tear your flesh, I am ripping your skin

[Chorus]
Dying you feel yourself slip away
Your dead body will be left, unburied
No one will find you dead

[Outro]
Fingerless hands clenched, I continue to dissect
Blood spurting from punctured flesh
Your naked body stripped of skin
Soon you will rotten
Insects infest your flesh
