[Verse 1]
Have you seen me lately?
What was it you saw?
Are you gonna catch me
With my hand in the jar, naked singing in the choir?

[Verse 2]
Have you seen me lately?
Did I look okay?
Are you gonna shame me
And take my toys away?

[Chorus]
Don't wake me unless you love me
It takes too long to fall back to sleep
Don't wake me unless you're a friend of mine
I'd rather just fall back on dreams

[Verse 3]
Have you seen me lately?
Did I miss a beat?
Are you gonna make me
Get back on my feet?

[Chorus] x2

[Outro]
Have you seen me lately?
Was I crazy?
Don't wake me, don't wake me
Don't wake me, donâ€™t wake me
