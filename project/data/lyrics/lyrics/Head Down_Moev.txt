So hard to see you
When you're in the room
All that you hate
Is but a picture of you
As vague as a screen
Under the red and blue
All that you hate
Is but a picture of you
No need to pine
Or hide anymore
Too late to answer
The knock on the door
No more long days waiting
Looking with hope to the sky
No need for reasons
No need for reasons
Why...
What you've been used to
What you've been through
Never known mercy
Have none to show
What you've been used to
What you become...
A little short of
What you used to want
No more long days waiting
Looking with hope to the sky
No need for reasons
No need for reasons
Why...
