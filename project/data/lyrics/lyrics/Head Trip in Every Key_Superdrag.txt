[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
I was hellbent to burn up the world
With a beautiful girl I created
Then my god said, "Take a powerful pill
Like a fool on the hill," and I waited

[Chorus]
Everybody wants to hang around
Everybody wants to bring me down
This simple prayer I say without a sound
Get me off the ground, uh-huh
Uh-huh, ah

[Verse 2]
Man, I lost it, I was losing my mind
I was dying to find a salvation
But I'm changing
I am making her mine and I'm trying to be a sensation

[Chorus]
Everybody wants to hang around
Everybody wants to bring me down
This simple prayer I say without a sound
Get me off the ground, uh-huh
Uh-huh, ah
Yeah!

[Solo]

 

[Intro]
Woo! Hey!

[Verse 1]
Sold you my therapy
You can suss it out
Bought a new enemy
She can smoke this doubt

[Chorus]
Every disgrace already made
Every word tasting bitter and betrayed
Looking for lies, sympathy fuck
Useless heart didn't want to change my luck

[Refrain]
What about today?

[Verse 2]
Sold you an alibi
Place me at the scene
I live a sorry lie
It burns like gasoline

[Refrain]
What about today?
