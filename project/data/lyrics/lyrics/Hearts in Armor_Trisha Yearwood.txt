You fight for every breath
Caught without a ship in this sea of neglect
The one you swore to love is pulling you down
You're in over your head
Chilled to the bone by the waters you've tread
Chart a course to land before you drown

Swim to the nearest distant shore
There's only so much a heart can endure
You gave it your best, forgive yourself
You can't hold on anymore

It's not as far as it might seem
Now it's time to let go of old dreams
Every heart for itself
Swim to the nearest distant shore

He said for you he'd change
Then he'd let you down and watch you take the blame
You're trapped between his lies and the great unknown
You vowed you would not fail
But this ain't success it's a living hell
There's nothing left to lose you're already alone

Swim to the nearest distant shore
There's only so much a heart can endure
You gave it your best, forgive yourself
You can't hold on anymore

It's not as far as it might seem
Now it's time to let go of old dreams
Every heart for itself
Swim to the nearest distant shore

Every heart for itself
Swim to the nearest distant shore...

 

You make me promises that you don't keep
Tears are expensive, honey, words are cheap
You tell me one thing, then do something else
And even though I know that all too well

I keep forgiving
I keep forgetting
I keep expecting you to change

You say you will
You say you will
You say you will
But you never do

Love doesn't come with any guarantees
It's give and take a little, that's the key
So I give you every little thing you choose
You give me back a stack of I.O.U's

There seems to be a pattern here
How can I tell if you're sincere

You say you will
You say you will, every time
You say you will
But you never do

Mmm, I keep forgiving
I keep forgetting
I keep expecting you to change

You say you will
You say you will, every time
You say you will
But you never do

You say you will
You say you will, you make it sound so sweet
You say you will
But you never....do
