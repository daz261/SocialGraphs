[Verse 1]
It don’t have to be that full for you
Only up to the waist-deep end
Pitch the baby
Sleeping don’t know you’re
Waking up as we see her sun

Hear the language
Come kiss your baby
Only hope to not bust somethin’
Here I want to grow and keep her warm
Man there must be somethin’ left still

[Refrain]
I only want to love you
I only want to love you

[Verse 2]
It don’t have to be that full for you
Only up to the waist-deep end
Pitch the baby
Sleeping don’t know you’re
Waking up as we see her sun

Hear the language
Come kiss your baby
Only hope to not bust somethin’
Here I want to grow and keep her warm
Man there must be somethin’ left still

[Refrain]
I only want to love you

[Bridge]
It still has to be too true for me
I only want to love you
It still has to be too safe for me
I only want to love you

[Outro]
I wander through the streets
Thinking I’ll fill their hearts with some sugar
And everything is sweet
Everybody says you favor me, baby

I wander through the streets
Thinking I’ll fill their hearts with some sugar
And everything is sweet
Everybody says you favor me, baby

I wander through the streets
Thinking I'll fill their hearts with some sugar
(I only want to love you)
And everything is sweet
Everybody says you favor me, baby

I wander through the streets
Thinking I'll fill their hearts with some sugar
(I only want to love you)
And everything is sweet
Everybody says you favor me, baby

 

[Verse 1]
I felt rewarded on being so ugly, eh
Oh, and you're a long shadow
I felt rewarded on being so ugly, eh
I felt rewarded on being so ugly, eh
Oh, and you're a long shadow
I felt rewarded on being so ugly, eh

[Verse 2]
Smile and face your wife angry
His life don't despise what's in eyes
He skips so as the seasons
To come as a breeze has
Again, ahead

[Verse 3]
We'll rust, our nose dust
Ephemeral with peace and, oh its true
He can't comfort the brain
He was calm as he was
Again, ahead

[Verse 4]
And is this safe flowing, love, soul and light
Motions all in motion emotions all
Good morning love with someone I call in light
Motions all in motion emotions all
And is this safe flowing, love, soul and light
Motions all in motion emotions all
