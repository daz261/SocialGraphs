For this I didn't learn until it was too late

[Verse 1]
I the black ruler that come forth from [?]
I and I, the almighty ruler, eyes fiery
And darkness is not a color, for I was in darkness and I created light
Incubated in night, meditated in sight
And you ask why I wear all white
Alright, I’m [?], also referred to as Elohim by the Hebrews, and Vishnu to the Hindus
I’m from the temples in [?]
Call me [?]
I’m Tiamat, the obelisk shadows three o’clock
Walk with us to see Enoch
The mystery key unlocks
The coffin [?], he speaks, we watch
People of Thebеs, ask pity of the gods, Pharaoh is dead
Not quite
Opеn this tomb
All praise to Amun and the sun which is Ra, later combined—Amun Ra, sun, moon and star
Yo, Moses knows this, before we toy with the cobras, we show them our culture, the same goes for Joseph
I show you them as pharaohs with different names in their sculptures
Omek’s, Hotep, [?], my thoughts are endless, my courts are crimson
And I am [?], the one before Musa when the law was given, you are my children
And I am Osiris, the writer of death
And I am his brother Set
Ra, the sun rises, and the sun sets
Abraham kneels before Melchizedek
As the twenty-four elders held the texts over Isis, Ra, El
Hold the scale, hold ‘em still while his feet and palms are kneel
Behold, the pale horse gallops along the trail
The name for gods were El [?], Nimrod, mighty hunter
His statue atop of the ziggurat steps
Me, Lamu and Lahamu then Ansha, then Kishar
And their offsprings was Antu, Kaht and Anu
From Choudians, the owl is seeing
During night, upon the Nile, a child
It’s floating down, streaming
But you have penalized angels and crowned demons
Come, meet Queen [?], we are winged celestials, extraterrestrial beings seen by the eskimos
We were here in the prehistoric Mexico
No, we’re not skeletal, and no, they were never an embryo
Dynastic period, indigo
The [?] descendants
The species that mimics our kindreds, but we weren’t monkeys
People of Thebes, ask pity of the gods, Pharaoh is dead
Not quite
For we came from the darkest part of the night
For with them, the shadows, the pharaohs gave you the apple to bite
These are the knowledge of good and evil
We also have the fruits to the tree of life
This is my un-key, put it in, turn it, unlock it and you will no longer be mummies
Around the garden, the meditating monks breathe slow and deep
And above the garden, the stars rearrange monthly
Twelve zodiacs, please don’t react
But it seems like Adam and Eve have company
Come with me, see the god they call Inke, or Aiya
His record was kept in the forms they wrote called [?]
At that time, there were doomsayers, sooth prayers, tomb raiders
It was called the departure, the moon was split
Or it was hit with ships that left moon craters
Here’s the Metu Neter, Neter is where you get nature
Let’s read the Vedas
Please, I need debaters
Do you believe in vapor, or what you see on paper?
The alpha and the omega, or the algebra creators
We are ancient, and you call us pagans

People of Thebes, ask pity of the gods, Pharaoh is dead

We are green for your sake because you have met with ill fortune, do not regret that you are required to sell off to him, for all existence is vanity, we desire no life in the hereafter, know now always that we blessed you with [?], for you who came to us from the river when we were already [?] were the greatest joy of our lives, may your heart be filled with full sorrow, such is the desire of your father

[Verse 2]
Behold, his feet, his arms was black, in the temple of Karnak
And along the walls show images of wars during Nubian combat
Above that was shapes and symbols of creatures like they had alien contact
But you are here in the house of dead
Above it all, the top of the hall, the Sumerian star map, that kept the records of when the heavens made Abraham his contract
All compact, Sargon’s plaque, over Akkad, [?]
Kings, elder gods in and outside of the realms of ours
But you are here in the house of dead
Images of [?] the third and King Tut close to birds
Do not touch or disturb the Egyptian magician’s words
His arm brushes, vision blurred, his wisdom slurred
But you are here in the house of dead
[?], attend to the Seder, make them believers
Where is thy brother Abel, am I my brother’s keeper?
Who are the other speakers? Those from the upper ethers
Wings like a raven, I am no pagan
But you are here in the house of dead

But you are here in the house of dead

I brought you the bodies of the man and a woman to be preserved by your aunt so that they may enjoy eternal life

As you say, we are [?] here, what can you pay for our services?

I have nothing, nothing

Throw this [?] in the river

Wait, I am willing to work here, to pay for the embalming, for as long as you say I must

Work here? Only condemned criminals and the accursed of the gods seek work in the house of dead

There is no man better than I am

Put him to work
