[Verse 1: Paul Weller]
I've got a grapefruit matter
It's as sour as shit
I have no solutions
Better get used to it

[Chorus]
I don't need a ship to sail in stormy weather
I don't need you to ruffle the feathers of my Peacock Suit
My Peacock Suit

[Verse 2]
I'm Narcissus in a puddle
In shop windows I gloat
Like a ball of fleece lining
In my camel skin coat

I don't need a ship to sail in stormy weather
I don't need you to ruffle the feathers of my Peacock Suit
Did you think I should?

Nemesis in a muddle
In a mirror I look
Like a streak of sheet lightnin'
In my rattle skin shoes

[Chorus]
I don't need a ship to sail in stormy weather
I don't need you to ruffle the feathers of my Peacock Suit
Did you think I should?
My Peacock Suit
Did you think I Should?

[Outro]
My Peacock Suit (yeah)
My Peacock Suit (year)
My Peacock Suit (yeah)
