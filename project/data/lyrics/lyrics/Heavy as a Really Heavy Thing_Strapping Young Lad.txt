Drive
He's trying to tempt me
Take me, down me, rape me, fuck her
Fuck yourself, you'll never take me alive

Goddamn this sun

Go, he's not the one

Take this away... July, July, July
Bring me rain

Drive
Keep calm
These are only just illusions
And whatever has been said
It has now gone completely wrong
But keep your head, don't freak
Keep your eyes upon the road
And just don't think about that room
Oh, holy fuck
Oh, holy fuck, oh, holy fuck

Goddamn this heat
Christ, goddamn this shit

Take this away... July, July, July
Bring me rain

He said, "I know that you know that I am the one
You know that I've found a way"
Don't die on me, don't leave me alone!
Give me this chance and I'll make it the last
I will never succumb
I will never succumb

 

Work expectations bind the holy to the wrong
Reflecting what they'll never be
Sing out, pay out another day has come and gone
Get used to the feeling of rotting

Just watch it, goat boy
You watch it, you're a goat

Down in the rust steel yard a goat boy loses limb
No need to feed old nan and kids
Old buck he pumps it up, to keep his life from getting low
Then back to compo when he's home

Just watch the goat boy
Just watch it, you're a goat
Let me hear the goat boy talk!
Don't judge me, goat boy

You watch it, you're a goat
