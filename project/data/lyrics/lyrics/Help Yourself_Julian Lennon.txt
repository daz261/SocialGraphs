No money no pride
Stick your finger in your eye
It's all a joke, it's just a ride
Save it for another guy
Kick yourself in the head
Pretty soon you will be dead
Get yourself another job
Don't become another slob
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Why don't you get a life

Nothing is a guarantee
Don't hide your face, don't beg and plead
Being sorry for yourself
Put another record on
You're the answer, you're the cause
You're just another perfect flaw
I'm just as scared as you, you know
But trying all the same

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Why don't you get a life
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Cheap talk won't get you far
Slandering in whiskey bars
Face the facts, the truth's inside
If you want peace, don't try and hide

You don't have to worry

'Cause everything's alright
You don't have to worry
We've made it through the fight
You don't have to hurry
'Cause harmony's in sight
You don't have to worry
Just trying to feel alright

Hey

In the end we're all afflicted
In the end we're all addicted
In the end we're junkies too
Unless you have a point of view
Swallow pride, it swallows you
Take that stride, I'll guide you through
Who's gonna help us in the end
Not your brother, not your friend

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Why don't you get a life
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Fear is just a crying shame
Work it out or go insane
Think about the world instead
'Cause if you don't
We'll all be dead

You don't have to worry
'Cause everything's alright
You don't have to worry
We've made it through the fight
You don't have to worry
'Cause harmony's in sight
You don't have to worry
I'm trying to shake the plight

Well I've been dreaming of a change that would take place
Where all of God's creatures would love the human race

Hey, oh, oh, oh, why don't you get a life
Oh, oh, oh

Being wealthy isn't bad
Despising it is what's so sad
Make a move
You've got a choice
Do something useful
With your voice

You don't have to worry
Cause everything's alright
You don't have to worry
We've made it through the fight
You don't have to hurry
Cause harmony's in sight
You don't have to worry
Just trying to feel alright
