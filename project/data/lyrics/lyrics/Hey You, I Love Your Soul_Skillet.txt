[Verse 1]
Jesus pure truth
Recollect my mind (ya-da-da-da)
Hurt that I push down
Shows my anger why
I can't go underground

[Chorus]
Everything I bury gets exhumed
I got to dig deeper
And all the things I bury gets exhumed
I got to dig deeper

[Verse 2]
I must get used
To strength out of weak (ya-di-da-da-da)
Becoming by what I give
Not by what I can keep
Exposed before You

[Chorus]
Everything I bury gets exhumed
I got to dig deeper
And all the things I bury gets exhumed
I got to dig deeper

[Outro]
How can I hide deeper
How I fly deeper in You
How can I hide deeper
How I fly deeper in You
How can I hide deeper
How I fly deeper in you
How can I hide deeper
How I fly deeper in you
How can I hide deeper
How I fly deeper in you
And everything I bury gets exhumed
And all the things I bury gets exhumed

 

[Verse 1]
I wanna be locked in a cage
I wanna be strapped in a chair, hey hey
I wanna be where you are
If my insanity comes, hey hey hey
Wrapped up inside your
I want to break my legs
In case of thought to escape, hey hey
Keep the hammer out of my reach
If my pounding impulse comes, hey hey hey
Wrapped up inside Your arms
Locked up inside You

[Chorus]
Hold me down cause I want to know You
You bring calm to my rage
You are life and I am thirsting for You
Hold me, hold me, locked in a cage

[Verse 2]
I love to be caught in you
I wanna be trapped in Your arms, hey hey
Your cage is rest to my bones
Your cage is peace to my soul, hey hey hey
Wrapped up inside Your arms
Locked up inside You

[Chorus]
Hold me down cause I want to know You
You bring calm to my rage
You are life and I'm thirsting for You
Hold me, hold me, locked in a cage

[Bridge]
Wrapped up inside Your
Wrapped up inside Your arms
I'm inside Your arms
I'm inside Your arms

[Chorus]
Hold me down cause I want to know You
You bring calm to my rage
You are life and I'm thirsting for You
Hold me, hold me, locked in a cage
Hold me down cause I want to know You
You bring calm to my rage
You are life and I'm thirsting for You
Hold me, hold me, locked in a cage

[Outro]
I'm locked, I'm locked
I'm locked, I'm locked
I'm locked, I'm locked
I'm locked
