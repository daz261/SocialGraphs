You traded all your tears
So I could see a happy face
You sat all alone and read
The writing on the wall
You broke your heart
And banged your cool up
As you fell from grace
You should've hung the net
Before you took the fall

The lines are pretty long here
But you'll stand here anyway

Chorus:
Until you see this ain't going over
There's nothing left to show for
Till you see
Time ain't gonna make up
For the times you'd never wake up for me

I watched you build a castle
On the beach one rainy day
I saw it fall apart and roll out with the tide
I think there's something metaphoric
That I'm trying to say
Open up your soap box
And just crawl inside
The lights are on but no ones home
Stand there in the dark

Chorus
