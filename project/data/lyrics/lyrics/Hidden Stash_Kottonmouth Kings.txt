Roll it up then, confrontation
Smoke it up then, heal the nation
Roll it up then, burn the ganja
I need to pass the roach because its burning my hand

Let me take you on a trip, deep where I venture
With the P-Town ballers in the city of Placentia
What we gonna do? Fool I though you knew
We're gonna fishbowl this bitch and roll the avenue
Man I'm barkin, park so we can get this sparked and
We'll score a fat sack and there won't be no more then
We'll make a right turn, the shef'll burn
Break out the two-four and put the bowl on turn
We need to hurry up because my high's straight escapin
We need a sixty roll because this bowl I'm sick of scrapin
We're gettin low on herb, I found a twenty on the curb
I got about a fifty, so Loc what's the word?
Its some herb, we bout to blaze it (that's what I'm sayin)
We'll score a fat sack and smoke till we're hazin
Never perpetrate me because we just got lifted
Saint call some freaks ,why me, cuz you're gifted

Roll it up then, confrontation
Smoke it up then, heal the nation
Roll it up then, burn the ganja
I need to pass the roach because its burning my hand

Saint we got low cuz we smoked all our dough
That shit was straight legit when I hit it I almost choked
Man he broke, and too bad we ain't no joke
Two hits and pass that, man I want another roach
The sad oversoked man I want some mo
That shit got me tipsy I almost fell out the door
Let me say times cuz that sucker livin'
Shake in my somthin that fools start trippin
What's a man to do when the avenues of life comes crashin down?
It makes me think twice, with the j out your hand
You ain't nothin but a rookie
Tryin to drop science but your mind is playin hooky
Pay attention Loc, I only speak the truth
Sing along with the song sendin out to the youth:
Roll a man a joint and he'll smoke for a night
Teach him how to roll and he'll smoke for life
Roll a man a joint and he'll smoke for a night
Teach him how to roll and he'll smoke for life

Roll it up then, confrontation
Smoke it up then, heal the nation
Roll it up then, burn the ganja
I need to pass the roach because its burning my hand

Man I'm gettin stressed, I need to hit the cess
I need to get some herb so I can calm my nerves
Lets get some sinsemilla, its twenty a quarter
Naw lets get some kind bud its willin to float ya
Now check it out I get a twenty from my girl
I get a quarter bag of the Mexi shwag that makes you hurl
Look what I got I just got my double chamber
We smoke it with a double, its clipped, prepare for danger
And if a stranger wants to get a taste of it
He can take a hit and trip and pay me for my rip
I try to have two sacks in case one gets lonely
There's a sign on my door that says bud smokers only
Bud smokers only, bud smokers only
There's a sign on my door that says bud smokers only

Man I'm gettin hungry we need to get some food
Man I need some chronic to get me in the mood
Well hold up, my pager is blowin up
Yeah that's X-Daddy, looks like we'll be rollin up

Roll it up then
Smoke it up then
Roll it up then
