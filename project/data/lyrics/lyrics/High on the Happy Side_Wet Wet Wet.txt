He sits alone in a crowded station
And lights his cigarette
The light flickers slightly
And tells him politely
His life's not at it's best

She weighs him up 'cos his love's taken lightly
And love's her only regret
But love's not a sin in her eyes
And she's asking him why - "Why are you leaving"
"I just can't say"
"Why are you leaving"
"He don't know daddy's gonna stay"
Put a little light in her darkest day
So she can see it
Put a little love in her heart on the way
So she can feel it

He walks home with his pride in his pocket
And pulls it out with his change
And his love is something and it just turned to nothing
Now isn't that strange

She holds her head high close to a bright sky
He's got his head in a cloud
But love's not a sin in her eyes
He's telling her why - "why are you leaving"
"I just can't say"
"Why are you leaving"
"He don't know daddy's gonna stay"

Put a little light in her darkest day
So she can see it
Put a little love in her heart on the way
So she can feel it
