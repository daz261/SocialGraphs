I've seen the Rocky's
Bloom in the springtime
Reflections of scarlet and gold

And I've seen the moonlight
Dance on the ocean
Like a silver ballet that unfolds

I've seen the bright lights
Of old New York City
There's nothing in the world that shines
Like the love in your eyes
Like the love in your eyes

There ain't no diamond
That ever has sparkled
There ain't no star that shines
Like the love in your eyes
Like the love in your eyes

I've had some good friends
Turn out to be strangers
Funny how quickly they turn

And I've had some lovers
That helped me discover
How easy it is to get burned

In this world of glitter
And cosmetic people
There's one thing that's real in my mind
It's the love in your eyes
It's the love in your eyes

There ain't no diamond
That ever has sparkled
There ain't no star that shines
Like the love in your eyes
Oh, the love in your eyes

Sometimes I wander
And loose my direction
Sometimes I go over the line

But it's such a comfort
And it's such a blessing
To know that you're there all the time

And I feel I'm driftin'
On a sea of confusion
There's a beacon that always shines
It's the love in eyes
It's the love in eyes

There ain't no diamond
That ever has sparkled
There ain't no star that shines
Like the love in your eyes
Like the love in your eyes

It's the love in your eyes
The love in your eyes
