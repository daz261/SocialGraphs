Somebody told me 'bout a worn-out distraction
That I, I let slip away
Then it comes back and rides my shoulders
And burdens me every new day...

Well I'll just sit here like a slow burn-out
And try to figure how to do without, without you

[Chorus]
Who's going to straighten me up
When I'm leaning?
Who's going to soothe my heart
When it's burning?
Who's going to be the one
To tell me everything's alright?
Well, goodnight, good guy

I'll break the bread of a new day
And wonder if faith will carry me along?
But days are longer as my heart gets weaker
And I can only stay so strong...

Well I'll just sit here like a wounded soul
Who's finding difficult to just let it go, let it go

[Chorus]...
...Well, if I let you sleep
...I'll let you fade off in the night, yeah
...I pray the Lord to keep
...I pray the Lord to hold you tight
...Well, goodnight

[Chorus x2]
