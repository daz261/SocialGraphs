How can I be sure in a world tha's constantly changing?
How can I be sure? Where I stand with you?

Whenever I, whenever I'm away from you
I wanna die 'cause you know I wanna stay with you
How do I know maybe you're trying to use me
Flying too high can confuse me
Touch me, but don't take me down

Whenever I, whenever I'm away from you
My alibi is telling people I don't care for you
Maybe I'm just hanging around with my head up upside down
It's a pity I can't seem to find
Someone who's as pretty and lovely as you

How can be sure?
I really, really, really want to know
I really, really, really want to know

How's the weather
Whether or not we're together
Together we'll see it much better
I love you, I love you forever
You know where I can be found

How can I be sure in a world that's constantly changing?
How can I be sure?
I'll be sure with you

 

Hearts gone astray, leaving hurt when they go
I went away, just when you needed me so
Filled with regret, I come back begging you
Forgive forget, with a love we once knew

[Chorus]
Open up your eyes, then you'll realize
Here I stand with my, everlasting love
Need you by my side, want to be your bride
You'll never be denied, everlasting love
From the very start, open up your heart
Be a lasting part of everlasting love

Real love to last forever
Real love to last forever

Where life's river flows, no one really knows
Till someone's there to show the way to lasting love
Like the sun that shines, endlessly it shines
You always will be mine. It's eternal love
Whenever love went wrong, ours would still be strong
We'd have our very own, everlasting love

Real love to last forever
Real love to last forever

You give me
You give me
You give me everlasting love
You give me
You give me
You give me everlasting love
You give me
You give me
You give me everlasting love

You know you give it to me
Everlasting love

[Chorus]
Open up your eyes, then you'll realize
Here I stand with my, everlasting love
Need you by my side, want to be your bride
You'll never be denied, everlasting love
From the very start, open up your heart
Be a lasting part of everlasting love

Real love to last forever
Real love to last forever

[Chorus]
Open up your eyes, then you'll realize
Here I stand with my, everlasting love
Need you by my side, want to be your bride
You'll never be denied, everlasting love
From the very start, open up your heart
Be a lasting part of everlasting love

Everlasting love
Everlasting love
Everlasting love
Everlasting love

You know you give me
You know you give me
You know you give it to me
Everlasting love

You know you give me
You know you give me
You know you give it to me
Everlasting love
Everlasting love
