Christmas time is here
Happiness and cheer
Fun for all that children call their favorite time of year

Snowflakes in the air
Carols everywhere
Olden times and ancient rhymes and love and dreams to share

Sleigh bells in the air;
Beauty every where;
Yuletide by the fireside
And joyful memories there

Christmas time is here;
Families drwing near;
Oh that we could always see such spirit through the year
