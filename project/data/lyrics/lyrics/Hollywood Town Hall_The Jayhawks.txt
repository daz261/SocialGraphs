[Verse 1]
It's taken you so long
Where can you be?
I would've laid my life down for you
Nothing seems real
Nothing seems real
Now that you're gone

[Verse 2]
Have you seen the sister's blue-eyed curls of gold?
Hell and no one there to be seen
The sunlight looks down
Stripped bare to the ground
Held by the leaves

[Chorus]
Been crowded in the wings
Mostly I don't mind
Been crowded in the wings
Then it's you I find
Then it's you I find
Then it's you I find

[Verse 3]
Two hundred yards
In front of the man
He could never see his way to another day
This time meant the same
Cold, cold, cold, cold once again

[Chorus]
Been crowded in the wings
Mostly I don't mind
Been crowded in the wings
Then it's you I find
Then it's you I find
Then it's you I find

[Bridge]
You brought me to
The mother of mountains
You brought me to
And no one reads to you at night
And all your lies came to pass
Just something I said
Made you turn your life in

[Chorus]
Been crowded in the wings
Mostly I don't mind
Been crowded in the wings
Then it's you I find
Then it's you I find
Then it's you I
Been crowded in the wings
Mostly I don't mind
Been crowded in the wings
Then it's you I find
Then it's you I find
Then it's you I

[Outro]
Been crowded in the wings
Been crowded in the wings
Been crowded in the wings
Been crowded in the wings

[Guitar Solo]
