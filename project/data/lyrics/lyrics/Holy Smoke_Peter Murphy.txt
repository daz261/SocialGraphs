Take me on a trip
Take me from the hip
Keep me cool and dry
Round the corner from the dip
It should not veer or lead astray
Or hide me from the truth
Take me soon and make it quick
Oh, I won't need no proof

You call me a liar
You say that you don't need me
Well sure, but I'll still be there reflecting
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
Kill the hate

I've always wanted to hide your problems
Wanted to save you pain
If only just to cover
You and all your stains
There's plenty left where that came from
And nothing I would hide
To make you face oblivion
And shake your shake your pretty pride
Kill the hate

I'll see you in the stratosphere
I'll meet you in the show
I'll visit you when you don't look
I'll melt you in the snow
Call your name
I'll laugh and talk aloud
See through your movie moves
I'll poke you with a poke
I'll kill the snake
I'll play you with a bow- I'll kill the hate
