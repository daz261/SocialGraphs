I know you think oh that you're one bad mother
Got no time, lord, for a rock and roll lover
You strut around like the original Queen of Sheba
To "I love you" you reply with "See you"

But this is how it's going to be
You're going to give your love to me
I know you won't come easily
But you're going to give your love to me

You got that face for a part in a devil's dream
You got that shape from a deal with a voodoo fiend
You're one of a kind, there surely ain't no other
Don't you see we're made for one another

But this is how it's going to be
You're going to give your love to me
I know you won't come easily
But you're going to give your love to me

But this is how it's going to be
You're going to give your love to me
I know your life is running free
But you're going to give your love to me

But this is how it's going to be
You're going to give your love to me
I know you won't come easily
But you're going to give your love to me

But this is how it's going to be
You're going to give your love to me
I know your life is running free
But you're going to give your love to me
