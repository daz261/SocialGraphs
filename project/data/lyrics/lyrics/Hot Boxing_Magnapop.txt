We were talking just the other day
A day away from here
And decided to lock you in a room
To let you realize your worth
I want to take you on a trip
So far away from everything
We have in common
Or had in common

We were talking just the other day
A day away from here
And decided to lock you in a room
And let you realize your worth
I want to take you on a trip
So far away from everything
We have in common
Or had in common

Too blind to notice
And too numb to really feel
Consider the virtues
And the need you really see
When you leave them behind
And watch them unwind
Leave them behind

We were talking just the other day

And decided to lock you in a room
And let you realize your worth
I want to take you on a trip
So far away from everything
We have in common

Too blind to notice
And too numb to really feel
Consider the virtues
And the need you really see
When you leave them behind
And watch them unwind
Leave them behind

Are you really clear there?
Can you really see behind?
