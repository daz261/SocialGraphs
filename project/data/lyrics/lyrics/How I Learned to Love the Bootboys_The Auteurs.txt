I'm in love
A rat tailed girl
Scared to dance
Our church hall

But it's better than being bitch-slapped
In the shrubbery
While the tea-time classes
Watching ITV

Chart Busters
Bootboys

All right, Oh yeah who's scared tonight?
All right, Oh yeah who's scared to dance

How I learned to love the bootboys
Round are way
Call them by their given names
Pass the time of day

Chart Busters (Chart busters)
Bootboys

All right, Oh yeah who's scared tonight?
All right, Oh yeah who's scared to dance

How I learned to love the bootboys
Give them half a chance
They're at the bottom of the road
They're at the top of the charts

They drag me like a Christian
Over the dance
I was dreading and dread
I was scared to dance

Youth records (Youth records)
Bootboys

All right, Oh yeah who's scared tonight?
All right, Oh yeah who's scared to dance
All right, Oh yeah who's scared tonight?
All right, Oh yeah who's scared to dance

How I learned to love the bootboys
