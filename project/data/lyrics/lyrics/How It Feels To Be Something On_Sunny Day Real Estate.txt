[Verse 1]
Roses in water
Wise men see
Move around before centuries
Later on, we'll travel far
Roses in wine
I can see strange ways

[Chorus]
An endless wave
Strange

[Verse 2]
Roses in water
Wise men see
Later on, we'll follow love
Roses in wine
I can see strange ways

[Chorus]
To walk with me
An endless wave
Strange
