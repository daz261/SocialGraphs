[Verse 1]
I can't find the rhyme in all my reason
Lost sense of time and all seasons
Feel I've been beaten down
By the words of men who have no grounds
Can't sleep beneath the trees of wisdom
When your ax has cut the roots that feed them
Forked tongues in bitter mouths
Can drive a man to bleed from inside out

[Chorus 1]
What if you did?
What if you lied?
What if I avenge?
What if eye for an eye?

[Verse 2]
I've seen the wicked fruit of your vine
Destroy the man who lacks a strong mind
Human pride sings a vengeful song
Inspired by the times you've been walked on
My stage is shared by many millions
Who lift their hands up high because they feel this
We are one, we are strong
The more you hold us down, the more we press on

[Chorus 1]

[Verse 3]
I know I can't hold my hate inside my mind
Because what consumes your thoughts controls your life
So I'll just ask a question, a lonely, simple question
I'll just ask one question

[Chorus 2]
What if, what if, what if, what if, what if I?
What if, what if, what if, what if, what if I?
What if, what if, what if, what if, what if I?
What if, what if, what if, what if, what if I?

[Chorus 1]
What if you did?
What if you lied?
What if I avenge?
What if eye for an eye?
What if your words
Could be judged like a crime?

[Chorus 2]
What if, what if, what if, what if, what if I?
What if, what if, what if, what if, what if I?
What if, what if, what if, what if, what if I?
What if, what if, what if, what if, what if I?

 

[Verse 1]
She wears a coat of color
Loved by some, feared by others
She's immortalized in young men's eyes
Lust she breeds in the eyes of brothers
Violent sons make bitter mothers
So close your eyes, here's your surprise

[Chorus 1]
Beautiful is empty
Beautiful is free
Beautiful loves no one
Beautiful stripped me

[Chorus 2]
Stripped me, stripped me
She stripped me

[Verse 2]
In your mind she's your companion
Vile instincts often candid
Your regret, is all that's left

[Chorus 1]
Beautiful is empty
Beautiful is free
Beautiful loves no one
Beautiful stripped me

[Chorus 2]
Stripped me, stripped me
She stripped me

[Chorus 3]
She told me where I'm going
And it's far away from home
I think I'll go there on my own

She told me where I'm going
And it's far away from home
I think I'll go there on my own

[Chorus 1]
Beautiful is empty
Beautiful is free
Beautiful loves no one
Beautiful stripped me

[Chorus 2]
Stripped me, stripped me
She stripped me
She stripped me
