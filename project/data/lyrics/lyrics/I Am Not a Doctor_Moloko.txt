If you hear me, baby, blink!
Do you even have the capability left to think?
There seems to be a missing link
Everybody's had a chance to see how far I can sink

As I try to call you back
As I try to call you back from the brink
If you hear me, baby, blink!

You're just so uptight
I don't suppose you have the energy to put up a fight
You just might implode before I get a chance at cracking the code
Take a good look around
Milk and honey's getting thin on the ground
If you hear me then make a sound

If you hear me, baby, blink!
As I try to call you back
As I try to call you back from the brink

If you hear me, baby, blink!
As I try to call you back
As I try to call you back from the brink

There will be no recompense when I'm screaming in the face of your silence
Still I draw a blank
Can't go down any further than I've already sank
If you're not there at all
Someone tell me why I'm talking to the wall
Do you hear me call?

If you continue to ignore these resonable demands
I'll be drawing up a new plan
The future is in your hands
Isn't it a crying shame your little game of hide and seek
Became so tiresome to me sometime last week?
The future is bleak

If you hear me, baby, blink!
As I try to call you back
As I try to call you back from the brink
If you hear me, baby, blink!
As I try to call you back

The lights are off
I know you're home
I burn your letters begging me to leave you alone
Keep your privacy
Your inner thoughts mean nothing to me
If you are waiting for me to take on my fair share of the blame
Honey your efforts are in vain
If you hear me call my name

If you hear me, baby, blink!
(If you hear me call your name)
As I try to call you back
As I try to call you back from the brink (repeat)

If you hear me, baby, blink!
As I try to call you back
As I try to call you back from the brink

Anybody, is there anybody in there?
Is there anybody, anybody in there?
Anybody, is there anybody in there?
Is there anybody?
