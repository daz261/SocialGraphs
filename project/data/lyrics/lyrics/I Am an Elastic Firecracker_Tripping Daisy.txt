[Verse 1]
I got a girl who lives with me
I got a girl she smells so sweetly
I got a girl she loves her dog
I got a girl I love her dog too!
I got a girl who stares in the mirror
I got a girl who blames it on her period
I got a girl she is so right
I got a girl she's my guiding light

[Chorus]
Well I know I need I feel we're going higher and higher
Well I know I need I feel we're going higher and higher

[Verse 2]
I got a girl who loves good soul
I got a girl who dances to disco
I got a girl who wears cool shoes
I got a girl who wears them in the nude
I got a girl who speaks her mind
I got a girl she'll argue anytime
I got a girl she is so small
I got a girl she'll knock down any wall

[Chorus]
Well I know, I need, I feel we're going higher and higher
Well I know, I need, I feel we're going higher and higher

[Bridge]
Get a load of this she's always bitching at me when I'm feeling down
Asking questions with her little frown
I can't take much much more of this, I'm out
Get a load of this she's always bitching at me when I'm feeling down
Asking questions with her little frown
I can't take much much more of this , I'm out

[Verse 3]
I got a girl I love to kiss
I got a girl I never want to miss
I got a girl who's my best friend
I got a girl that won't even hold my hand
I got a girl that makes me laugh
I got a girl I'll make her laugh too
I got a girl she has girlfriends
I got a girl I like her girlfriends

[Chorus]
Well I know, I need, I feel we're going higher and higher
Well I know, I need, I feel we're going higher and higher

[Outro]
I got a girl
I got a girl
I got a girl
And she's got a guy
