[Verse 1]
Whatever you want from me
Whatever you want I'll do
I'll try to squeeze a drop of blood
From a sugarcube

[Verse 2]
Try to be more assured
Try to be more right there
Try to be less uptight
Try to be more aware

[Verse 3]
Whatever you want from me
Is what I want to do for you
Sweeter than a drop of blood
On a sugarcube

[Bridge]
And though I like to act the part of being tough
I crumble like a sugarcube for you

[Verse 4]
Whatever you want from me
Whatever you want I'll do
And I will try

[Verse 1]
Whatever you want from me
Whatever you want I'll do
I'll try to squeeze a drop of blood
Squeeze a drop of blood from a sugarcube
