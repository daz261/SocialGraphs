[Verse]
Girl, don't bother in locking door
He's out there hollering
"Darling, don't you love me no more?"
You always let him in before now, didn't you?
He's just singing the same old song that he always sang before
He's the last of the hard-core troubadours

[Verse]
Now girl, better figure out which is which
Wherefore art thou Romeo, you son of a bitch?
You'd just as soon fight as switch now, wouldn't you?
He's come to make love on your satin sheets
Wake up on your living room floor
He's the last of the hard-core troubadours

[Chorus]
And now he's the last of the all night do right
Stand beneath your window till daylight
He's the last of the hard-core troubadours
Baby, what you waiting for?

[Verse]
Girl, figure out what you're gonna do
When he moves on again and he leaves you alone and blue
But you knew he is just passing through now, didn't you?
And now you can't just say this is the last time, baby
Like you always did before
He's the last of the hard-core troubadours

[Chorus]
And now he's the last of the all night do right
Stand beneath your window till daylight
He's the last of the hard-core troubadours
Baby, what you waiting for?

[Outro]
He's the last of the all night, do right
Hey Rosalita, won't you come out tonight?
He's the last of the hard-core troubadours
