Bad or a wet dream
Feeling so in-between
Gun in my pocket and
A target on my head
Right on the wrong road
He talks to me through dogs
Not sure who it is
But I know it ain't God

Feel like they're watching me
Know that they're watching me
Come on, let's go
Got two tickets to the moon

Now, what are you supposed to do
When they got their hooks in you?

Do you believe me?
I was there
And did you hear it?
Yeah

Not my fault, wasn't even there
Rest of the world, all gone insane
Can you hear the dogs barking?
Can you hear the dogs speak?
Seen it on the TV
Something gonna break

Now, how am I supposed to breathe
When there is no air?
And how am I supposed to be
If those hooks are pulling me down?

If you release me
Won't be there
And if you leave me
I won't care

I hear black
And have no mercy
I hear black
It has no mercy
Repeating in my head

In my head, in my head
In my head, in my

From the inside out
Talk to me in tongues
The worst of this I understand
That the flies are breeding
Wounds are bleeding
There'll be no healing in my house

From the inside out
From the inside out
From the inside out
You know I'm not the same

If you release me
Won't be there
Why won't you leave me?
I won't care

I hear black
It has no mercy
I hear black
It has no mercy
Repeating in my head

Repeating in my head
Repeating in my head
Repeating in my head
In my head
