[Verse 1]
The bed gives
The cover might break underneath you
Hard as I try, ooh
The table will shake
And break a leg
When I do what I do
I use all of my mind

[Chorus]
Consider the love we'll make
When pleasure can be found
In and all around the right place is on the floor
Why don't we get down on the floor?
I won't leave you wanting for more
If we get down on the floor
On the floor
On the floor, yeah

[Verse 2]
Comfortable spot
When I got you hot
A place to lay your head
Was it Socrates who said, "Good to the last drop", lady
Oh, feel so sweet
From your head to your feet
Your face is turning red
Now my appetite's fed

[Chorus]
Consider the love we'll make
When pleasure can be found
In and all around the right place is on the floor
Why don't we get down on the floor?
I won't leave you wanting for more
If we get down on the floor
On the floor
On the floor, yeah

[Bridge]
When you're satisfied
That's when I'll give you more
It's gonna rain
Let it pour
And if you're gonna stay
And you're willing to play
It's time that we openly, honestly
Get on the floor
On the floor, yeah

[Outro]
I need you here
Oh my dear
The floor
On the floor, yeah
There's more and more and more and more
On the floor, floor
On the floor, yeah
On the floor, on the floor
Floor, on the floor, yeah
On the floor, on the floor

 

[Intro]
Your love is ooh
Your love is ooh baby

[Verse 1]
Contemplate, as we lay
Caught up in your web of pleasure
Let me get my thoughts together
Concentrate, stimulate
Ecstasy cannot be measured
I finally found my treasure

[Chorus]
When I think about the love we make
I can't find the words to say
Your love is ooh, baby, your love is ooh baby
When I think about the love we make
I run out of breath and I start to shake
Your love is ooh, your love is ooh baby

[Verse 2]
Take the sun
Take the moon
All I ever need is you
You make my dreams come true
Through the storm, nice and warm
Girl, you know just what to do
You know just what to do

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm just an ordinary man
I don't understand
Why the way that I feel gets so hard
For me to explain
Am I dreaming?

[Chorus]
When I think about the love we make
I can't find the words to say
Your love is ooh, your love is ooh baby
When I think about the love we make
I run out of breath and I start to shake
Your love is ooh, your love is ooh baby

[Bridge]
And my heart is beating
Sore from being loved so beyond my needs
All I know, I want the world to know
Your love is ooh
Your love is ooh
Your love is ooh
Your love is ooh baby
Baby

[Outro]
Ooh, ooh ooh
Early in the morning
Your love is ooh
Your love is ooh
Your love is ooh baby, baby, baby
Ooh, in the evening, yeah, ooh ooh
Late in the midnight hour
Your love is ooh
Your love is ooh
Your love is ooh baby, baby
