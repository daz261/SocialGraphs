[Chorus]
Sleigh bells ring, are you listening
In the lane, snow is glistening
A beautiful sight, we're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland

[Post-Chorus]
Gone away is the bluebird
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song as we go along
Walking in a winter wonderland

[Verse 1]
In the meadow, we can build a snowman
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say, "Are you married?" We'll say, "No man"
But you can do the job when you're in town

[Refrain]
Later on, we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid, the plans that we've made
Walking in a winter wonderland

[Chorus]
Sleigh bells ring, are you listening
In the lane, snow is glistening
A beautiful sight, we're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland

[Post-Chorus]
Gone away is the bluebird
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song as we go along
Walking in a winter wonderland

[Verse 2]
In the meadow, we can build a snowman
And pretend that he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun with Mr. Snowman
Yes, until the other kiddies knock him down

[Refrain]
Later on, we'll conspire
As we dream sittin' by the fire
To face unafraid all the plans that we've made
Walking in a winter wonderland
Walking in a winter wonderland
