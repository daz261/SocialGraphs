You've got money
And I want it
You've got a beautiful house
And I want it
You've got a beautiful life
And I want it
You've got a beautiful car
And I want it

I want, I want, I want...
I want what you have

You've got a beautiful wife
And i want her
You've got a beautiful face
And I want it
You've got a beautiful body
And I want it
You've got what you want
And i want it too

I want, I want, I want...
I want what you have

You've got too much
And I want it
You've got too much
And I want it

I want, I want, I want...
I want what you have
