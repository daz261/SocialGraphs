Go!
You can take my work
You can take my place
I think you're a fool
I think you've got bad taste
You can take your flag
You can take your pride
You can bend right over
Your asshole's open wide
Open wide, here I come!
Yeah right, I've got pride
Pride in a system
That's designed
To waste all your minds
Go! USA
It's the way
So wave them real high on flag day
It's your right to be proud
So scream it and shout it, shout it, shout it aloud
Buy into lies
The government feeds your meathead mentality
Go, Go to work
Don't do it for you, but for state, country, national church
It's the way, today
Your paycheck will wash sins away
It's okay
Don't be afraid until Uncle Sam robs you blind
Did you hear what I said you are blind
Hear what I said you are blind
Blind
My country tis of thee, sweet land of liberty, full of national pride
Come on baby open wide
You can take my work
You can take my place
You can let them win
Spit right in your face
Spit right in your face
Spit right in your face
Spit right in your face
Spit right in your fucking face
