I pay rent on a run-down place
There ain't no view but there's lots of space
In my heart, the heart that you own

I pay the rent, pay it right on time
Baby I pay you ever single dime
For my heart, the heart that you own

Used to be I could love here for free
Way back before you bought the property
Now I pay daily on what once was mine
Lord I probably owe you for these tears that I cry

'Cause I pay rent on a run-down place
There ain't no view but there's lots of space
In my heart, the heart that you own

I struggle each night to find a new way
To pay what I owe just so I can stay
I ain't overdue so you can't throw me out
I've loved here for years don't know where I'd go now

'Cause I pay rent on a run-down place
There ain't no view but there's lots of space
In my heart, the heart that you own

Yea, my heart, the heart that you own
