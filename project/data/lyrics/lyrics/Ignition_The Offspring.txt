[Verse 1]
We are one with ourselves
We don't give a shit about anyone else
Well, it won't be long
Until our day in the sun is going to stop
The walls come tumbling down

[Chorus]
We are one
We are free
We are headed for obscurity
We are one
We are weak
We are going to make ourselves extinct

[Verse 2]
We are one
You know it's true
Don't fuck with us or we'll fuck with you
It's a mentality that kills the best
We'd better stop
The walls come tumbling down

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
We are one, and it won't be news
When we hang ourselves with one collective noose
Well, it won't be long
Until our day in the sun is going to stop
The walls come tumbling down

[Chorus]

[Outro] x6
Bigger they come, harder they fall
