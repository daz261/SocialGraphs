It's in my head now
It's in my mind now
It's in my face now
It's in my brain now

(chorus)
City of mutants
Darker than night
Evil illusion
Guided by light
The friends you thought
They never were
Egos and icons
They just don't care
You hope to die quiet
Laying in bed
It's better than pointing
A gun to your head

(chorus x 2)
All cold and forgotten
You only feel pain
This quest for hope
Is a losing gain
Another dream crumbles
In front of your eyes
Your paranoid vision
Only sees spies

(chorus)

 

A living giving corpse so weak
A sacred path where do we fall
Desired anguish fear of life
Makes martyrs of us all
Delusioned prayers fill the air
A hopeful soul is hard to see
Human cruelty frozen in time
A world so hard to feed

(chorus)
Nothing seems to matter
The rain begins to fall
Nothing to believe in
Even angels learn to fall

A trantic march into the sea
Being hunted to extinction
This human bond of frail mortality
A tarnished ground of true conviction
A teardrop falls behind closed walls
There's so much more of life to see
The closing of the door
The mind and so much more
A broken moment to believe

(chorus x2)
Torment and anger
Runs through my veins
Leaving me cold inside
Surrender your feeling
Unfolding is the veil
Turning love to despair
This anger
A silent rage
This anger
A silent rate
