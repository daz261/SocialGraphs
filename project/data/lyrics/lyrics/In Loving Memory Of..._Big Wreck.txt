[Verse 1]
So, I always get nostalgic with that song
But in my room it's forced
It has to be in some car across the street
And I always catch the back of your head in a crowd
Just don't turn around
It's never you and you ruin those memories
And those photos are great if
I catch them with the side of my eye
But if I stare, it just turns into you and me
We're just standing there

[Chorus]
And now its over
Would you hear me
Scream at the top of my lungs
And when you go there
Would you hear me
Scream at the top of my lungs

[Verse 2]
So I always fool my friends and we head down there
You think that we are en route
We just drove past your old house
And you weren't there
And I'm always great when I'm hanging
With your buds and they lie
They think that I'm just fine
Its always been that way, just a pocketbook Brando

[Chorus]
And when you hold him
Would you hear me
Scream at the top of my lungs
You love my whisper
But did you hear me
Scream at the top of my lungs

[Verse 3]
So you crank that song
And it might sound doom
So just leave the room
While I sit and stare
Cause this is rare
I really love that tune
Man, I love that song
I really love that song
I love that song

[Chorus]
So when you go there
Would you hear me
Scream at the top of my lungs
And when you're hated
Would you hear me
Scream at the top of my lungs

[Outro]
So you crank that song
And it might sound doom
So just leave the room
While I sit and stare
Cause yeah, that's rare
I really love that tune
Man, I love that song
I love that song
I love that song
