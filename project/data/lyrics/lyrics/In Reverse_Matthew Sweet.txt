Have to wonder if I care
If I want to know you only
As if you weren't really there
You begin to touch me slowly
I don't feel it any more
Than I feel the path I follow
Everything I gave away
Was supposed to come back

I believe my love
I didn't mean to hurt you
Beware my love
You know you don't deserve to be abused

Ask me if I want to know
No I won't be needing to
I got a message from the country
And I'll be leaving soon

Believe my love
I didn't mean to hurt you
Beware my love
You know you don't deserve to be abused
My love
I didn't mean to hurt you for myself

Believe my love
I didn't mean to hurt you
Beware my love
You don't deserve to be abused
My love
I didn't mean to hurt you
Beware my love
You know you don't deserve to be abused

Have to wonder if I care
If I want to know you only...
