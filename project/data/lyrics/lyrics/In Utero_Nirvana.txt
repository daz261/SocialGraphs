[Verse 1]
Like most babies smell like butter
His smell smelled like no other
He was born scentless and senseless
He was born a scentless apprentice

[Chorus]
Hey, go away
Go away
Go away

[Verse 2]
Every wet nurse refused to feed him
Electrolytes smell like semen
I promise not to sell your perfumed secrets
There are countless formulas for pressing flowers

[Chorus]
Hey, go away
Go away
Go away

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
I lie in the soil and fertilize mushrooms
Leaking out gas fumes are made into perfume
You can't fire me because I quit
Throw me in the fire and I won't throw a fit

[Chorus]
Hey, go away
Go away
Go away
Go away
Go away
Go away
