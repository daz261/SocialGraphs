[Verse: Cristina Scabbia]
I just need you absolutely
All the fears in your mind
I just want you absolutely
To sail this ship of mine...

[Pre-Chorus: Andrea Ferro and Cristina]
I don't know what the hell you say
'Cause you're going blind, using
All the lies they taught to hurt
In your mind... your... mind...
Your... mind...

[Chorus: Cristina]
And I... I can breathe now...
I can breathe now...
Now... yeah, now...

[Bridge: Andrea and Cristina]
It's there, pretends to be a guide for you
Like a candle in the dark
Lies like a really cold breeze in the air
Step by step you'll lose your faith

[Verse: Cristina]
I just need you miserably
Broken man come to me...
I just need you desperately
Just want you to change your mind...

[Pre-Chorus: Andrea and Cristina]
I don't know what the hell you say
'Cause you're going blind using
All the lies they taught to hurt
Your mind... your... mind...
Your... mind...

[Chorus: Cristina]
And I... I can breathe now...
I can breathe now...
Now... yeah, now...

[Verse: Cristina]
I just need you miserably
I just need you desperately
I just want you absolutely
To sail this ship of mine...

[Chorus/Outro: Cristina and Andrea]
And I... I can breathe now...
I can breathe now...
Now... yeah, now...

 

[Verse: Andrea Ferro]
Close your eyes
Don't you feel the rejection, baby?
Doesn't it hurt?
Come there now
I've got somethin' to tell you, honey
I don't want you back

[Pre-Chorus: Cristina Scabbia]
Won't you take me back?
Won't you take me back with you?
Won't you take me back?
Won't you wrap me with your love again?

[Chorus 1: Andrea, Cristina]
Get out of my life
I know I failed you
But I'll make it up
Get out of my life
I know I failed you
Just let me try again

[Chorus 2: Andrea, Cristina]
You're to blame
(Can't you see I'm prayin')
I'm no more your business
(For your forgiveness)
You’re too late
(Can't you see I'm prayin')
I'm no more your business
(For your forgiveness)

[Verse: Andrea]
Shut your mouth
I don't need your affection, darling
Doesn't it hurt?
Come here now
I've got somethin' to tell you, honey
I don't want you back

[Pre-Chorus: Cristina]
Won't you take me back?
Won't you take me back with you?
Won't you take me back?
Won't you wrap me with your love again?

[Chorus 1: Andrea, Cristina]
Get out of my life
I know I failed you
But I'll make it up
Get out of my life
I know I failed you
Just let me try again

[Chorus 2: Andrea, Cristina]
You're to blame
(Can't you see I'm prayin')
I'm no more your business
(For your forgiveness)
You’re too late
(Can't you see I'm prayin')
I'm no more your business
(For your forgiveness)

[Bridge: Cristina]
I'll do anything you want
But hold me forever
Be a nightmare in my sleep
Scare me forever
Like a bullet in my soul
Kill me forever
All the lies I have sold to you
Are soul thorns in my mouth

[Pre-Chorus: Cristina]
Won't you take me back?
Won't you take me back with you?
Won't you take me back?
Won't you wrap me with your love again?

[Chorus 1: Andrea, Cristina]
Get out of my life
I know I failed you
But I'll make it up
Get out of my life
I know I failed you
Just let me try again

[Chorus 2: Andrea, Cristina]
You're to blame
(Can't you see I'm prayin')
I'm no more your business
(For your forgiveness)
You’re too late
(Can't you see I'm prayin')
I'm no more your business
(For your forgiveness)

[Chorus 2/Outro: Andrea, Cristina]
You're to blame
(Can't you see I'm prayin')
I'm no more your business
(For your forgiveness)
You’re too late
(Can't you see I'm prayin')
I'm no more your business
(For your forgiveness)
