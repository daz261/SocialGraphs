Who else is new I want to believe
The way you do I still can't see
Love love love love that's all it is
Try my lines try my tricks
Why be artistic look at me to be linguistic to be domestic
Lemme imagine this lasting blasting falling twisting
I will be there and we will dare
This is the moment as for the future
I will be there and we will dare

 

Living in dreams
You as me distilled from you be
Still no moves
Hide your wild
Side instill more time

In an armed
Life now you...

Know why exist
Unless wish
You as me
With you hide your
Wild side
Dissolve more time

In an armed
Life now you know...

Is this for me liquid loving
Is this for me distilled loving

Know why exist
Unless wish
You as me
With you hide your
Wild side
Dissolve more time

In an armed
Life now you know...

Is this for me liquid loving
Is this for me distilled loving
