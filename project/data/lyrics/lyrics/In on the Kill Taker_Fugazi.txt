The eyes have it and the eyes always will
The eyes have it and they're watching you still
You'll see, you'll see tonight
I'll be watching cause I want you tonight
All right

Public witness charter - look but don't touch
Public witness says he's seeing too much
You'll see, you'll see tonight
I'll be looking cause I want you tonight
All right

I like to walk around it
I'm paid to stand around it
I like to walk around it
I'm paid to stand around it
I like to walk around it
I'm paid to stand around it
I like to walk around it
I'm paid to stand, to stand around

Can I get a witness
A witness with ears

I like to walk around it
I'm paid to stand around it
I like to walk around it
I'm paid to stand around it
I like to walk around it
I'm paid to stand around it
I like to walk around it
I'm paid to stand around it

Public witness seen it all

 

Fine disservice
Deceptive, too
Check for the sender
Sender was you

Caught me wide open
No simple burn
This is complicated
Calls for return

Fine disservice
Intended, too
Check for the sender
Sender was you

The point has been recorded
The malice has been revealed
When I stripped away the humour
From the arrow that it concealed
Sharpened, soaked in urine, it was
Meant to spread disease
But now discovered becomes
The sweet antithesis

Returning the screw
Returning the screw
Returning the screw
Returning the screw
Returning the screw
Returning the screw
Returning the screw
Returning the screw
It comes back to you
