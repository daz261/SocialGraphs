I remember how
The sun came shining through the trees
Made shadows on the road
I was driving home
The morning after with the taste of you
Still on my tongue

You are my safety zone
I live and breathe in you

I'll never find a better love not in a minute
I'll never find a better love not in a minute
Never a better love, never a better love

On the harbour bridge
The rain was gently falling down
On a lazy summer day
Your face appeared there on my windscreen
You smiled and slipped away

You are my safety zone
I live and breathe in you

I'll never find a better love not in a minute
I'll never find a better love not in a minute
Never a better love, never a better love

You are my safety zone
I live and breathe in you
You are where I belong
I live and breathe in you

I'll never find a better love not in a minute ....

 

Everything's gonna be alright everything's gonna be alright

Well I remember when we used to sit
In the government yard in Trenchtown
Observing all the hypocrities as they would
Mingle with the good people we meeet
Good friends we had good friends we've lost
Along the way
In this great future you can't forget your past
So dry your tears I say I say

Everything's gonna be alright yea it's gonna be alright
Everything's gonna be alright yea
Everything's gonna be alright come here little sister
Everything's gonna be alright don't you shed no tears

No woman no cry no woman no cry
No woman no cry no woman no cry

I remember when we used to sit
In the government yard in Trenchtown
And then Georgie hey would light the fire light
As it was love wood burning through the night
And we would cook some cornmeal porridge
Of which I'd share with you see my feet's my only carriage
So I got to push on through but while I'm gone I mean

Everything's gonna be alright hey it's gonna be alright
Everything's gonna be alright
Everything's gonna be alright hush little sister
Everything's gonna be alright so don't you shed no tears

No woman no cry no woman no cry
No woman no cry no woman no cry

Everything's gonna be alright yea it's gonna be alright
No woman no cry don't you shed no tears
Everything's gonna be alright I say hush little sister
No woman no cry

Everything's gonna be alright it's gonna be it's gonna be alright
No woman no cry no woman no cry
Everything's gonna be alright yea I know it's gonna be alright
No woman no cry come here little sister
