So this is love, or so you tell me
As you're walkin', out the door
Months go by, and I know for certain
It's not the love, I'm lookin' for

Some times, just for a moment
I reach out; hope you're still there

Miles away
No; you're never turnin' back
I just can't wait anymore
Miles away
Nothin' left of what we had
Just when I needed you most...
You were miles away...

It's hard to tell, what you're goin' through
You kept your feelings locked inside of you
Open your heart, and chances are
What you're feelin', I'm feelin' too

If only, just for a moment
Hold on, to the dreams that we had

Miles away
No; you're never turnin' back
I just can't wait anymore
Miles away
Nothin' left of what we had
Just when I needed you most
You were miles away

When times were tough, and you were down and out
Who was there by your side?
Now you've gone; I'm so tired of bein' alone..
With only your promises...

Lonliness just fades away
Thoughts of you; just memories
No cryin' now, for what we're missin'
Time won't forget what you meant to me

Hold me, just for a moment
Hold on, to the dreams that we had

Miles away
No; you're never turnin' back
I just can't wait anymore
Miles away
Nothin' left of what we had
Just when I needed you most, whoa-oh
Miles away
No; you're never turnin' back
I just can't wait anymore
Miles away
Nothin' left of what we had
Just when I needed you most...

You were mi-les a-way...

 

Rainbow In The Rose (5: 34) (Winger/Beach)
Deep inside my hunger grows
Got to find the rainbow in the rose

Somewhere the spirit shines
Like the moonlight - I move on....
Somewhere the spirit shines - but
I'm still....

Searching for the rainbow in the rose
Rainbow in the rose
If you can lead the way, than baby I will follow
Searching for...
I'm still looking for the
Rainbow in the rose

In the howling wind I first heard the voice
To be free again, it said
Find the rainbow in the rose

Somewhere the spirit shines
Like a holy light - we move on....
Someday it will be mine - but
I'm still....

Searching for the rainbow in the rose
Rainbow in the rose
If you can lead the way, than baby I will follow
Searching for...
I'm still looking through the window at the...

Rainbow in the rose
Owner of my devotion
The deeper my hunger grows - oh
Got to look inside, got to try to find the
Rainbow in the.... Rose

Seaching for the rainbow in the rose
If you can lead the way, than baby I will follow
To find the rainbow
I'm just looking through the window at the
Rainbow in the rose....
