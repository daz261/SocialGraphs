So hard when anger's never felt so good
Beauty's only all I want to see
The windows regardless open everything
Funny how we pass them everyday

You're the lady with her calves all ripped up into seams
Your passing by is all I get to see
Lately I fear it's been too much for me
Funny how I pass her everyday

It's just when nothing ever changes
Drink the wine it rearranges
We'll be lying soon
On Lusitana's moon

We'll be lying soon

So high when courting comes by in the room
Slavery only not too far away
You and yours are always trying for everything
Funny how I pass you everyday

It's just when nothing ever changes
Drink the wine it rearranges
We'll be lying soon
On Lusitana's moon

I find that nothing ever changes
Just drink the wine to rearrange us
We'll be crying soon
On Lusitana's moon

So hard when anger's never felt so good
And beauty's only all I want to see
The sour Lusitana's ruling everything
Her body always sadly wrappes away

It's just that nothing ever changes
Drink the wine it rearranges
We'll be lying soon
On Lusitana's moon

I find that nothing ever changes
Just drink the wine to rearrange us
We'll be crying soon
On Lusitana's moon
