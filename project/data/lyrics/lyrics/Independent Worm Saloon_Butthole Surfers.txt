I can't believe it
Talking to people here
Cowboys and Indians
Have taken control
It really was a wild one
But summer has come and gone
A lot of nice people would fade away

Hold back seasons
Take back the memory
Hold on to something
Better hold on to you
It really was a wild one
But summer has come and gone
A lot of nice people would fade away

Girl: "You are gonna die up there"
(sound of pissing)
