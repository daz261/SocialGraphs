[Verse 1]
What do you want from me
What is it you expect
I have spoken my mind
From deep inside my soul

[Pre-Chorus]
Behind the eyes is a place
No one will be able to touch
Containing thoughts
That cannot be taken away or replaced

[Chorus]
You want what is not yours
Jealousy
You want what you cannot have
Jealousy

[Bridge]
Spiteful harsh words
It comes as no real surprise
Tell me what you are

[Verse 2]
I cannot understand
How you seem to exist
On what people create
For you, good must turn bad

[Pre-Chorus]
Behind the eyes is a place
No one will be able to touch
Containing thoughts
That cannot be taken away or replaced

[Chorus]
You want what is not yours
Jealousy
You want what you cannot have
Jealousy
