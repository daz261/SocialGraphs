[Verse 1]
Another season crashes to an end
The branches you thought you'd break
Well, they just bend
They just bend

[Verse 2]
Now jumping off your northern wall
Sixteen air mattresses bursting as you fall
And when you hit the ground, you'll see
The fall you meant to carry sets you free

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's burn last Sunday
Let the week go by
Let's burn last Sunday
Watch the ashes fly
Let's burn last Sunday
Any section's fine
Let's burn last Sunday
Let me close my eyes

[Chorus]
'Cause if you burn last Sunday
Well, if you burn last Sunday
Well, that fire's back sometime

[Verse 3]
???? that be
[?]
Don't fool me
I was before, seconds ahead
Landmines and porcupines
It's all in your head

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's burn last Sunday
Let the week go by
Let's burn last Sunday
Watch the ashes fly
Let's burn last Sunday
Any section's fine
Let's burn last Sunday
Let me close my eyes

[Chorus]
'Cause if you burn last Sunday
Well, if you burn last Sunday
Well, that fire's back sometime

[Outro]
Let's burn last Sunday
Let's burn last Sunday
Well, if you burn last Sunday
Well, that fire's back sometime

 

Sneakin' into the balcony
Velvet curtains on the walls
Well I might jump or I might fall
I am not decided

Stare into your selfish [?] screen
Film is melting happily
Brown is turning into gold
I'm falling through these holes

Gracefully
You hit your mark
While acting is naive
The arc of lights
Above your head
Is not to be believed

Oh your marquee!
Your marquee!

And your publicist was great
She got me this date
And although I can't complain
I do not like champagne

You love the trading cards of fame
And what rhymes with insane?
And I lie about the champagne
Yeah I lie about it

Gracefully
You hit your mark
While acting is naive
The arc of lights
Above your head
Is not to be believed

Oh your marquee!
Your marquee!

Will I see you in the parking lot?
Can I see you in the parking lot?
Will I see you in the parking lot?
