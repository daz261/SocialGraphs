How can it be this
This and only this
Hunger destroys me
And picks bones clean

How can it be this
This and only this
That separates me
From a monkey

I'm not buying
All this lying

How can it be this
This and only this
My conscience keeps me
From a bad way

How can it be this
This and only this
That separates me
From a monkey

Put my hand in a club
Then a shotgun
Trade it in for a knife
Sharpen every night

I'm not buying
All this lying
