Urrrgh!

You save yourself and no one else
You take my time and call it yours
The things you've done won't fade away
I'm a slave to my mind and no one else
Yeah no one else

It won't mean a thing when you're gone
Won't mean a thing

Can't break those toys with you
My tenure things you once do
Good friends you left behind
Cast, you thought, by a good light
Yeah, by good light

It won't mean a thing when you're gone
It Won't mean a thing

You are just a slave to dollar signs
You are a slave

 

Snow beat down in the shadows
No sunlight ever shines
Dark skid marks plug the mud
On the leafy incline

No voice to speak about
No movement in the trees
No lovers struggle for release
On the fallen autumn leaves

I've gotta know I'm not alone
Just one soul
I've gotta know I'm not alone
Just one soul

Small cabbage grows in bunches
And fungus wood has bones
Dark water rain goes through
All pathways fill with stones

No voice to speak about
No movement in the trees
No lovers struggle for release
On the fallen autumn leaves

I've gotta know I'm not alone
Just one soul
I've gotta know I'm not alone
Just one soul
