[Hook]
Only Rasta can liberate the people
Over hills and valleys too
Don't let them fool you
Don't believe for a minute that they are with you
Jah free the people
Over hills and valleys too
Don't let them fool you
Don't believe for a minute, they don't like you

[Verse 1:]
Why try to make I unhappy
Really I don't know
If it was up to them my friend
We would never see the sun nor the snow
Through that mystical communication within
We keep on coming together
I love to see brothers and sisters
Looking out for one another
That's the way it should be
Not contrary, stop tearing down each other

[Hook]
Only Rasta can liberate the people
Over hills and valleys too
Don't let them fool you
Don't believe one minute that they are with you
Jah free the people
Over hills and valleys too
Don't let them fool you
Don't believe for a minute, that they are with you

[Verse 2:]
Hard drugs won't do
You're just behaving like they want you to
Arrogance is much different from ignorance
And I know you feel the same way too
Many live this life without having a clue
No reason why they are so sad and blue
Places to go so much things to do
Not a moment to reflect on the cycle of life

[Hook]

[Bridge]
It hard, it hard, it hard (yeah)
Mek them know we waan go home a we yard
It hard, it hard, it hard (let them know)
Let them know we waan go home a we yard
It hard, it hard, it hard (let them know)
Let them know we waan go home a we yard
It hard, it hard, it hard (oh god)
We waan go home

[Hook]

[Repeat Verse 1]
