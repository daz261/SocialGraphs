[Verse 1]
Sitting in my class
Just drifting away
Staring into the windows of the world
Yeah
I can't hear the teacher
His books don't call me at all
I don't see the bad boys trying to catch some play

[Chorus]
'Cause I love your smile
I love your smile

[Verse 2]
The clock at work says three
And I wanna be free
Free to scream, free to bathe
Free to paint my toes all day, woo!
My boss is lame you know
And so is the pay
I'm gonna put that new black mini on my charge anyway

[Chorus]
'Cause I love your smile
Hey, said I love your smile

[Bridge]
Time came and showed me your direction
Now I know I'll never ever go back
Taught me that
I can be a better girl
With the love you give
You rock my world
You dig?

[Rap]
I'm showin' the life that I'm living
This is the life that I have and it's given to you
Yeah and it's true
La-dee-da
Twinkly dee
Do you, believe in a girl like me?
Shanice is the one for you to be with
But when I'm caught all alone
I start fessing
It's from a state of depression
And the thunder clouds of doubt move in
I begin to wonder
"Do you still love me?"
But after that
My whole world is beautiful

[Saxophone solo]

[Break]
Blow, Branford, blow

[Bridge]
Time came and showed me your direction
Now I know I'll never ever go back
Taught me that
I can be a better girl
With the love you give
You rock my world
Smile, sike

[Chorus]
Ooh, I love your smile (smile for me)
Yes I do boy, hee
I love your smile
I love your smile, baby

[Outro]
Heee, heee, heeee, heeeee
I love your smile
I really do (hahahahahaha)

 

Yeah, baby

I wanna tell
I wanna tell you, baby
What's going on, yeah

[Verse 1:]
So you call me up and say
"Girl what's goin' on?"
Someone told you
I had done you wrong

People always talking (yeah)
Sayin' crazy things
It's just jealousy

Well, if you wanna know the truth
Boy, I'm telling you
Hey

He was just a friend of mine
If we start to question each other
It'll tear us apart
Baby, let's not start

[Hook:]
Don't you doubt my love
I'm never gonna give you up
Who can you believe
Your friends or me?

I'm not gonna leave
Oh, baby
I will always be

[Chorus:]
Forever in your love
Forever in your love
Forever in your love
Forever in your love

[Verse 2:]
Stood right by your side, babe
Held you through the night
I never let you down

When you need someone to believe in
Put your trust in me
Ain't that what love's about?

[Repeat Hook:]

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Rap:]
When I'm home sitting alone
Thinking about you
Yeah
And what we do together
Makes me want more
'Cause I'm sure
That I'm forever in your love

What you do for me
You know a kiss from head to toe
Makes me wanna scream to the heavens up above
Knowing that
I'm forever in your love

Baby
Yeah, word to your mother

[Repeat Hook:]

[Repeat Chorus:]
