[Intro]
And you're rushing headlong
You've got a new goal
And you're rushing headlong
Out of control
And you think you're so strong
But there ain't no stopping
And there's nothing you can do about it
Nothing you can do, no
There's nothing you can do about it
No, there's nothing you can, nothing you can
Nothing you can do about it

[Chorus]
And you're rushing headlong
You've got a new goal
And you're rushing headlong
Out of control
And you think you're so strong
But there ain't no stopping, no
There's nothing you can do about it
Yeah!

[Verse 1]
Hey, he used to be a man
With a stick in his hand
(Hoop diddy diddy, hoop diddy do)
She used to be a woman
With a hot dog stand
(Hoop diddy diddy, hoop diddy do)
Now you've got soup in the laundry bag
Now you've got strings
You're gonna lose your rag
You're getting in a fight
Then it ain't so groovy
When you're screaming in the night
Let me out of this cheap B-movie!

[Chorus]
Headlong, down the highway
And you're rushing headlong
Out of control
And you think you're so strong
But there ain't no stopping
And you can't stop rocking
And there's nothing you can, nothing you can
Nothing you can do about it

[Verse 2]
When a red hot man
Meets a white hot lady
(Hoop diddy diddy, hoop diddy do)
Soon the fire starts raging
Gets you more than half crazy
(Hoop diddy diddy, hoop diddy do)
Ooh, now they start freaking
Everywhere you turn
You can't start walking
Cause your feet got burned
It ain't no time to figure wrong from right
Because reason's out of the window
Better hold on tight

[Chorus]
You're rushing headlong
Headlong
Out of control (yeah!)
And you think you're so strong
There ain't no stopping
And there's nothing you, nothing you
Nothing you can do about it at all

[Guitar solo]
Yeah, yeah
Alright, go!

[Chorus]
And you're rushing headlong
Down the highway
And you're rushing headlong
Out of control
And you think you're so strong
But there ain't no stopping
There's nothing, nothing
Nothing you can do about it, yeah

[Outro]
Ha ha
Headlong
Yeah, yeah, yeah (rushing)
Headlong
Headlong
Headlong
Gnoldaeh, gnoldaeh, gnoldaeh, gnoldaeh
