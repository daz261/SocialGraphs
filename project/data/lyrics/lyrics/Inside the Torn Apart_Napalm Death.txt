Feast your eyes on
It reflects on
Can't pertain to
Can't belong to
Vicious cycle
Faultless conflict
Self-preserving
Birth in regress
In the midst of confusion
The warm sound of shelter
Shelve the plans of expansion
The warm sound of shelter
Promising all
Deliver nothing
Dependently reassuring
Come to terms with
Serves no purpose
Self-preserving
Birth in regress
Set in motion
Visual concepts
Sabotage the birth in regress
To subdue the calm before the storm
In it's stillness. in it's stillness
To subdue the calm before the storm
In it's stillness. desperate measures
To feel so unworthy
To see the apathy
To turn the cold shoulder and stop
To desperate measures
Reversing in circles
A thought unappealing
How long can you maintain enthusiastic faces?
Any way, shape or form
