[Verse 1]
Mom and dad don't look so hot these days
They're getting over the hill
Death is closing in and catching up
As far as I can tell
Got a plan of action and cold blood
And it smells of defiance
I'll just wait for Mom and Dad to die
And get my inheritance

[Chorus]
Well, now I want more, 'cause I'm getting bored
And I'm going nowhere fast
I was once filled with doubt, but it's all figured out
Well, nothing good can last

[Verse 2]
Crow's feet and rot are setting in
And time is running out
My parents' income interest rate
Is gaining higher clout
I'm a snot-nosed slob without a job
And I know I damn well should
Mom and Dad don't look so hot these days
But my future's looking good

[Chorus]
Well, now I want more, 'cause I'm getting bored
And I'm going nowhere fast
I was once filled with doubt, but it's all figured out
That nothing good can last

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Well, now I want more, 'cause I'm getting bored
And I'm going nowhere fast
I was once filled with doubt, but it's all figured out
That nothing good can last
