Hold up your end
And I'll hold up mine
Dancin' all the time
Dancin' all the time
And too late, father
You know that that's for sure
You never find a way
Never find a way

So gather around
And see what the day brings
And see what makes you laugh
And see what makes you sing
And never, nevermind
The thing that people say
You'll never go away
You'll never go away

Who knows where the storm will take us
Who knows when the pain will break us
When will all the G's be given
Another chance to live in freedom

Hey now, get your heart
Get your heart off of the shelf
Make the grey sky blue
Yeah, I'm talkin' to you
And nevermind
The sick and the afraid
Askin' out today
To see a brighter day

So gather around
And see what the day brings
And see what makes you laugh
And see what makes you sing
And never, nevermind
The thing that people say
You'll never go away
You'll never go away

Who knows where the storm will take us
Who knows when the pain will break us
When will all the G's be given
Another chance to live in freedom

So gather around
And see what the day brings
And see what makes you laugh
And see what makes you sing
Oh, never, nevermind
Nevermind what the people say
You'll never go away
You'll never go away

Gather around
And see what the day brings
See what makes you laugh
Makes you sing...

 

Hey kids, get your gear
This is your vacation
Climb aboard this yellow bus
To your destination
Hey lift man, lift me up
It's an occupation
And I wanna have a good time

At Alpental, the skiing's all at night
With alcohol, your dreams are all in white
Like Idaho, the wintertime
You felt was yours to live
You felt was yours to live
The one good time you felt was yours to to live

Silver streaks are there to mark our tracks
A million miles on empty
(A million miles on empty)
Brown baggin' from our packs
I'd better get me some gin please
(Can I get some gin please?)
Double Diamond is way too rough
It's-a outside regulation
'Cause I wanna have a good time

At Alpental, the skiing's all at night
With alcohol, your dreams are all in white
Like Idaho, the wintertime
You felt was yours to live
You felt was yours to live
The one good time you felt was yours to live

At Alpental, the wintertime
You felt was yours to live
You felt was yours to live
The one good time you felt was yours to live

(And I wanna have a good time)

At Alpental, the skiing's all at night
With alcohol, your dreams are all in white
Like Idaho, the wintertime
You felt was yours to live
You felt was yours to live
The one good time you felt was yours to live

At Alpental, do-do do do-do
At Alpental, do-do do do-do
At Alpental, do-do do do-do
At Alpental, do-do do do
