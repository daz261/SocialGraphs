[Verse 1]
Diane's got everything
A helicopter and a submarine
Yeah man, you're just what this world needs
Diane lives in a sanctuary
She swears to Jesus she'll never marry
Yeah man, you're everything to me

[Chorus]
Diane, Diane, Diane, Diane, Diane
Diane, Diane, Diane, Diane, Diane

[Verse 2]
Diane is everywhere
Pretending that she just don't care
Diane, I hear you're just nineteen
Diane's a superstar
She's everything you hoped you were
Diane, you're all these things to me

[Chorus]
Diane, Diane, Diane, Diane, Diane
Diane, Diane, Diane, Diane, Diane

[Bridge]
She's got everything she wants in the world, Diane
Pretending to be some kind of calendar girl
Well, I'll pull you out and pin you down, Diane

[Outro]
Diane, Diane, Diane, Diane, Diane
Diane, Diane, Diane, Diane, Diane
Diane, Diane

 

[Verse 1]
Oh, yes, it's me writing this letter
And, God, how I hope that it makes me feel better
And, yeah, it's me, the end of your line
Though I don't say a word, I call all the time
I'd like to tell you the way I feel for you
But I'd only be lyin' to myself

[Verse 2]
Oh, yes, it's me, I'm drivin' past your house again
I drive by all the time, but I never stop in
Oh, yeah, it's me, I'm wavin' hello again
I'm only pretending you're someone I know within
I'd like to show you the plans I've made for you
But I don't need anyone but myself

[Chorus]
You can't have everything, no, not everything I want
But I want everything, oh, yeah, everything you've got

[Verse 3]
Oh, yeah, it's me on the end of the line
Though I don't say a word, I call all the time
And, yes, it's me, I'm ringin' your bell again
If he answers the door, I'll run like hell and then
I'd like to tell you (Ooh), how much I love you (Ooh)
But I don't love anyone anymore

[Chorus]
You can't have everything, no, not everything I want
But I want everything, oh, yeah, everything you've got
You can't have everything, no, not everything I want
But I want everything, oh, yeah, everything you've got

[Outro]
Oh, yeah, it's me writing this letter
