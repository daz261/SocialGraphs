[Chorus]
Have I told you, have I told you
Have I told you, have I told you
You could really get it on?
You could really get it on?

Have I told you, have I told you
Have I told you, have I told you
You could really get it on?
You could really get it on?

[Verse 1]
I was at an all night diner
The sign said, "Triple X" but they were talking about root beer
I'm just sitting down, thinking about nothing
Looking at the thin air, breathing up the oxygen

[Pre-Chorus]
Have I told you, have I told you
You could really get it on?
You could really get it on?

[Verse 2]
A guy comes up that's looking pretty 8-ball
Snaggletoothed smile, sits down at my table
Puts his arm around me, starts to share his information
He said, he said, he said
He said, he said, he said
He said, he said, he said, he said
He said, he said, he said, this is what he said
"I have sex, I'm always thinking about the pavement
So I can avoid premature ejaculation"
I got up, remembering to thank him
Better things to do, so I'll start drinking now

[Chorus]
Have I told you, have I told you
Have I told you, have I told you
You could really get it on?
You could really get it on?

Have I told you, have I told you
Have I told you, have I told you
You could really get it on?
You could really get it on?

[Verse 3]
I'm in Tahoka, now I'm going to hook up
With the parties, unfortunately, like always
No one has any ideas, damn

[Chorus]
Have I told you, have I told you
Have I told you, have I told you
You could really get it on?
You could really get it on?

Have I told you, have I told you
Have I told you, have I told you
You could really get it on?
You could really get it on?

Have I told you, have I told you
Have I told you, have I told you
You could really get it on?
You could really get it on?

Have I told you, have I told you
Have I told you, have I told you
You could really get it on?
You could really get it on?
