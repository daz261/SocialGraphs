[Verse 1]
When the time gets right, I'm gonna pick you up
And take you far way from trouble, my love
Under a big ol' sky out in a field of green
There's gotta be something left for us to believe

[Chorus]
Oh, I await the day
Good fortune comes our way
And we ride down the Kings Highway

[Verse 2]
No, you can't hide out in a six-gun town
We wanna hold our heads up, but we gotta stay down
I don't wanna end up in a room all alone
Don't wanna end up someone that I don't even know

[Chorus]
Lover, I await the day
Good fortune comes our way
And we ride down the Kings Highway

Yeah, I await the day
Good fortune comes our way
And we ride down the Kings Highway

Yeah, I await the day
Good fortune comes our way
And we ride down the Kings Highway

 

[Verse 1]
Eddie waited 'til he finished high school
He went to Hollywood, got a tattoo
He met a girl out there with a tattoo, too
The future was wide open
They moved into a place they both could afford
He found a night club he could work at the door
She had a guitar and she taught him some chords
The sky was the limit

[Chorus]
Into the great wide open
Under them skies of blue
Out in the great wide open
A rebel without a clue

[Verse 2]
The papers said Ed always played from the heart
He got an agent and a roadie named Bart
They made a record and it went in the charts
The sky was the limit
His leather jacket had chains that would jingle
They both met movie stars, partied and mingled
Their A&R man said, "I don't hear a single"
The future was wide open (Oh)

[Chorus]
Into the great wide open
Under them skies of blue
Out in the great wide open
A rebel without a clue
Into the great wide open
Under them skies of blue
Into the great wide open
A rebel without a clue (Ayy)
