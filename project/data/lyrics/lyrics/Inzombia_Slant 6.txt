Give me some more reverb
I need some more treble
I like it this treble
And lots of delight
Put me on ultra high
Or on overdrive
Sound makes you feel sunny
Makes you feel alive

[Chorus]
Stand by
Stand by
Stand by
Stand by
For some power, power, power

Give me some more reverb
I need some more treble
I like it this treble
And lots of delight
Sensitivity you want
Sensitivity too
I don't care which one you use
It's all up to you

[Chorus]

It's all [?]
