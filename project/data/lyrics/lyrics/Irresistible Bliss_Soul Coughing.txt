White girl, Market at Van Ness
Heels to drag, discombobulated
Air all soft around, hear the man singing
Inclines and wires, Telegraph Avenue

Look away and she's eastbound, out of sight

Dropped here by the hand of the astronaut
Builder of the pyramids, the man from outer space
Innocent farmgirl raised by the aliens
Out in Northridge, out in the larger world

Look away and she's eastbound, out of sight

Up out of sight, white girl... white girl...
