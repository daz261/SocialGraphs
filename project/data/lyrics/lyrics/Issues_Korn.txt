[Verse 1]
Hey, I'm feeling tired
My time has gone today
You flirt with suicide
Sometimes that's okay
Do what others say
I'm here standing hollow
Falling away from me
Falling away from me

[Verse 2]
Day is here fading
That's when I'm insane
I flirt with suicide
Sometimes kill the pain
I can't always say
"It's gonna be better tomorrow"
Falling away from me
Falling away from me

[Chorus]
Beating me down!
Beating me, beating me
Down, down
Into the ground!
Screaming some sound!
Beating me, beating me
Down, down
Into the ground!

[Break]
Falling away from me
It's spinning round and round
Falling away from me
It's lost and can't be found
Falling away from me
It's spinning round and round
Falling away from me
Throw it down

[Chorus]
Beating me down!
Beating me, beating me
Down, down
Into the ground!
Screaming some sound!
Beating me, beating me
Down, down
Into the ground!

[Bridge]
Twisting me!
They won't go away!
So I pray!
Go away!
Life's falling away from me
It's falling away from me
Life's falling away from me
Fuck!

[Chorus]
Beating me down!
Beating me, beating me
Down, down
Into the ground!
Screaming some sound!
Beating me, beating me
Down, down
Into the ground!
Beating me down!
Beating me, beating me
Down, down
Into the ground!
Screaming some sound!
Beating me, beating me
Down, down
Into the ground!
