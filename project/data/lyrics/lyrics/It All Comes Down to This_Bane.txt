Calling you out for the last time
Come show your face for the first time I've got a head full of questions
And a busted heart filled with lies
Won't spend one second on my knees
Will not be thankful for what I have not asked for
Or apologize for hating all that my eyes see
This solution is my salvation
Life is too slippery for books clarice
The time has passed for tricks like faith and grace
The beast laughs more and more everyday
Evil has never been afraid to show it's face
Just look to the front page
Look into the face of the starving
Or infants born with a disease they will never understand
For every miracle one million bodies

Piled high in your name I'm calling you out
Come show your face
Stand before me I will destroy you
Shed your mask and I will destroy you
The priests that serve so proudly in your sons name
As sick as any monster that walks the streets
And I'd walk away just to see you cry
Leading young boys into the hell
That they have preached against
Once You tell me how they can ever trust in
Cause loving words are only words when loving words mean nothing
One single word that you have said
Your empire has been built on the guilt of the meek
To your heart...

And I walked away
So many lives imprisoned
And I haven't seen, seen that smile for a while
And a shame that spins out of control in your name
And now I'm choking on my self-segregated heart
Young Tommy who finds you only in his father's shiny handguns
Marches his truth straight into school
Points the barrel and pulls the trigger
And bodies turn into colored rain

Tell me a story I can believe
Look me in the eye
And tell me a story that you believe
