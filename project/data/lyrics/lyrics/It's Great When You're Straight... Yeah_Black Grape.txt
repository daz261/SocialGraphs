It's coming from the side!
And it's coming from the back!
People!
Multitudes of people!
Walking up the hills!
Go forward!

In the name of the father and the holy ghost
In the name of your father and your holy ghost

I don't do what you do
And you don't do what I do
But you should do
You
Oh, you've got your voodoo
But you've got no clue
You know me easy bongo poo-poo for me

Well because I'm no learned
Well I get away with murder
Going boldly where no man's been before

Ere we go, ere we go
Once ag-ain

In the name of the father and the holy ghost
I have the holy spirit in me!
In the name of the father and the holy ghost
I have the holy spirit in me!
Neil Armstrong
Astronaut
He had balls bigger than King Kong!
Fay Wray!
First big suit on the moon
And he starts to play golf!
Hole-in-one!

[ Psycho raps? ]

Here we go, 'ere we go
Once ag-ain

In the name of the father and the holy ghost
I have the holy spirit in me!
In the name of the father and the holy ghost
I have the holy spirit in me!
[ Psycho raps? ]

In the name of the father and the holy ghost
I have the holy spirit in me!
In the name of the father and the holy ghost
I have the holy spirit in me!
In the name of the father and the holy ghost
I have the holy spirit in me!
In the name of the father and the holy ghost
I have the holy spirit in me!
In the name of the father and the holy ghost
In the name of the father and the holy ghost
In the name of the father and the holy ghost
In the name of the father and the holy ghost
In the name of the father and the holy ghost
In the name of the father and the holy ghost
In the name of the father and the holy ghost
In the name of the father and the holy ghost...

 

Yeah, we're having a Temazepam party

Good evening!
And welcome to the Temazepam party
Just slide inside and help yourself
We have a wide selection of downers
For your love and enjoyment
So sit down and gouch out
At your own leisure

Welcome to tramazi parti
Just sit down and slide inside
We'll get some go-go girls for the (?)
If you call around you'll have me
Just like you were Dirty Harry
We'll fill up your carrier bags like a leg of lamb

I've got my boots on my head
It's full of jellies in the double bed
And no-one knows what no-one said

Welcome to your nightmare
You can have it if you treat it right, yeah
Welcome to your nightmare
You can have it if you treat it right, yeah

Tramazi!
Yer spazzy!
I'm loving the parti
Passed round the eggs
And forget everybody!

Nobody knows what bignose said
It's full of jellies inside his head
Or something to that effect
Look for the bodies under the gate
Waheyhey, what did he say?
I don't remember just not now
Oh yeah, I've got my boots on my head
It's full of jellies in the double bed
And no-one knows what no-one said

Welcome to your nightmare
You can have it if you treat it right, yeah
Welcome to your nightmare
You can have it if you treat it right, yeah

Trip trip nine
Don't do the line (?)
Watch the unkind
Huffs and puffs
Brother on the cuff
Needle's stuck!
Funny little eggs
Time makes no sense
Suck up the dregs
Vapour trails
All in the air
I paid the fare

I've got my boots on the back of my head
It's full of jellies in the double bed
And no-one knows what no-one said

Welcome to your nightmare
You can have it if you treat it right, yeah
Welcome to your nightmare
You can have it if you treat it right, yeah

Welcome to your nightmare
You can have it if you treat it right, yeah
Welcome to your nightmare
You can have it if you treat it right, yeah

Oh yeah
Hey what ?

Welcome to your nightmare
You can have it if you treat it right, yeah
Welcome to your nightmare
You can have it if you treat it right, yeah

Welcome to your nightmare
You can have it if you treat it right, yeah
Welcome to your nightmare
You can have it if you treat it right, yeah...
