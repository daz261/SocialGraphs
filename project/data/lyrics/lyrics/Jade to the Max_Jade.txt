[Verse 1:]
Your reputation caught my attention
I just can't help myself
I want nobody else

You look so fine
Let's spend some time
I wanna make love to you
You're all that I wanna do

I wanna give you a tasty secret
I wanna melt in your hand
Just gotta show you that I can love you
Until you understand

[Chorus:]
I wanna love you
I wanna love you down, baby
I wanna love you
I wanna love you down, baby

[Verse 2:]
You've got it going on
With you I belong
You undress my heart
From the very first start

You do understand me
Give your body to me
Baby, don't let me go
Feel my love overflow

I'm gonna give you a tasty secret
That's gonna melt in your hand
Just wanna show you that I can love you
Until you understand

[Chorus:]
I wanna love you
I wanna love you down, baby
I wanna love you
I wanna love you down, baby

I wanna love you
I wanna love you down, baby
I wanna love you
I wanna love you down, baby

[Bridge]
Let me love you
Let me love you down, boy
I love you
Adore me
And I adore, adore, adore, adore you

[Chorus:]
I wanna love you
I wanna love you down, baby
I wanna love you
I wanna love you down, baby

I wanna love you
I wanna love you down, baby
I wanna love you
I wanna love you down, baby

I wanna love you
I wanna love you down, baby
I wanna love you
I wanna love you down, baby
