He's a stone Delta blues man
He's a top rollmo' star
He's a stone Delta blues man
He's a top rollmo' star

Black wand, white magic, nitroglycerine
He's earned the right to be known as

Machine Gun Ibiza
Voodoo up rollmo' down
Machine Gun Ibiza
Hangin' ten with the hurricane sound

If you've never been nowhere
Don't you pay that no mind
If you've never been nowhere
Don't you pay that no mind

Feel part of no circle?
If you make no scene
Well you've earned the right
To hang out with

Machine Gun Ibiza
Voodoo up rollmo' down
Machine Gun Ibiza
Hangin' ten with the hurricane sound

If you're a goddess
If your heart's sixteen
Girl you're gonna wake up buddies with

Machine Gun Ibiza
Voodoo up rollmo' down
Machine Gun Ibiza
Hangin' ten with the hurricane sound

Ooh light a fire - Be an ex-marine
Baby learn to burn your dog tag like

Machine Gun Ibiza
Voodoo up rollmo' down
Machine Gun Ibiza
Hangin' ten with the hurricane sound

Hangin' ten with the hurricane sound
Hangin' ten with the hurricane sound
Hangin' ten... sound

Machine Gun Ibiza
Voodoo

 

[Verse 1]
There was that girl I used to know
She'd tease me about my name
Fan the embers long enough
I sometimes catch her flame

The soothing voice of distance tells me
That was just a fling
Other music fills my ears
But I still hear her sing

She sings:

[Chorus 1]
"Paddy Joe! Say, Paddy Joe
Don't you remember me?
How long ago one gorgeous night
We let the stars go

Paddy Joe! Say, Paddy Joe
Don't you remember me?
How long ago one gorgeous night
We let the stars go free"

[Short guitar break]

[Verse 2]
There was a boy I used to be
I guess that he was cold
If she came to buy him now
How cheaply he'd be sold

But the light is gone and it is dark
What used to be the sky
Is suddenly embarrassing
To the naked eye

[Chorus 2]
"You see, Paddy Joe
See, Paddy Joe
Can't face this memory
How long ago one gorgeous night
We let the stars go

Paddy Joe
See, Paddy Joe
Can't face this memory
How long ago one gorgeous night
We let the stars go

Long ago one gorgeous night
We let the stars go

Long ago one stupid night
We let the stars go free"

[Chorus variation]
(We let the stars go free
We let the stars go free)
We let the stars go free
We let the stars go free
