Whoo whoooo .. all aboard .. last train to Memphis ..

Well it's the last train to Memphis
Ride the Tennessee Eagle
A lonesome whistle in the night
Echoes off the river

Take the last train to Memphis
Get the southbound Eagle
The King is gone but he still lives on
Deep in the heart of the people

Take the last train to Memphis
We gonna have a real good time
Memphis sits on top of the river
Right on the Arkansas line

Take the last train to Memphis
Put on your dancin' shoes
They got a lot of good music in Memphis
That's why she's the home of the blues

Ride the Eagle
Get on board
Ride the Eagle all night long
Next stop Graceland's door

Ride the Eagle
Get on board
Cross the Arkansas border by midnight
Next stop Graceland's door

It's the last train to Memphis
Ride the Tennessee Eagle
Memphis in May where we sing and we play
Party down with the people

Take the last train to Memphis
You better get on board
If you wanna see where the King come from
When he was a little boy

Take the last train to Memphis
Ride the Tennessee Eagle
The King is gone but he still lives on
Deep in the heart of the people

Ride the Eagle
Get on board
Ride the Eagle all night long
Next stop Graceland's door

Ride the Eagle
Get on board
Cross the Arkansas border by midnight
Next stop Graceland's door

Ride the Eagle
Get on board
Ride the Eagle
Get on board
Last train to Memphis
Last train to Memphis
Last train to Memphis
Last train to Memphis
Ride the Eagle
Get on board
Ride the Eagle
