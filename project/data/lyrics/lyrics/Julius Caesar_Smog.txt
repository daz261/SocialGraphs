47 push ups
In a winter-rate
Sea side motel

I feel like travis bickle
I'm listening to highway to hell
It's a shitty little tape I taped off the radio

39 push ups
In a winter-rate
Sea side motel

32 push ups
In a winter-rate
Sea side motel

Not looking too good
Not feeling so well

37 push ups
In a winter-rate seaside motel
I'm going up again
I'm going up again
Goin' up to go down again
