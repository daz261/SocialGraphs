Every little thing that can go wrong
Don't you know I realize
All the trouble that goes on so long
Restoration of it seems so wise
But when the hope and the love has gone
You're the one the world is searching for
Hold on for the way gets clear
For your love, for our love
That's what I'm saying

Angel of mercy
Won't you stay with me, won't you stay with me?

Take a little water to cool you down
Reach out to your furthest dream
If you find that you've been turned around
Get back up and try again

Though your future's not plain
Your effort's not in vain
For we are in need of
Your sweet touch - please be near us

When the sun turns to rain
Then our loss can be gain
If you could reach out
Take my hand, yeah

 

Oh what a shambles has been my day
I know I have to go to work but I wanna play
Well, I'm lookin' at my watch and it's almost half past three
And it's time for tea
And I don't want nobody tellin'
Trying to tell me
What I have to do and what I have to be

You know I just wanna have some fun
Yeah now, come on and have a party
Yeah, well, have some fun

Let me tell you now
All through the day the night's been on my mind
Now I've got myself together, baby, and you're lookin' fine, so fine
And I'm lookin' at my watch and it's almost half past eight
Now then don't be late
I don't want nobody tellin'
Telling me and you
Who we have to be or what we have to do

I know you've got some lovin', it's something we can share
We're gonna have a big night out, even if they say we ain't goin' nowhere

I see you walkin' to my car, lookin' like something sweet to eat
Girl, you're my brightest star
Come on now, let's get it. Let's get it

Everybody on the dance floor, everybody get up
Everybody keep movin', let's have some fun
