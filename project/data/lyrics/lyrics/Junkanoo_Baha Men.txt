We've got a bell
We've got a drum
Junkanoo has begun
Fell that boom bang beat shining down on are dancing feet
So now you now it's junkanoo
Come on and lets go
Come on and lets go

See that star in the sky
Time to sing a noel

Angels chanting from a'high
Time to sing a noel
Time to sing a noel

Sing a noel
Time to sing a noel
Time to sing a noel
Time to sing a noel
Time to sing a noel
