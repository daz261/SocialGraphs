Thank god this stuff is really pure
Tulips and helicopters
Strange people hide in the bushes
Your face is so many colors

He was wild-eyed and nervous
Said he couldn't take the city
There's too much freedom
Can he really be so foolish

I couldn't talk in the restaurant
Kept laughing when you opened your mouth
Felt like everyone was staring
We were fools to leave the house

He was wild-eyed and nervous
Said he couldn't take the city
There's too much freedom
Can he really be so foolish
Why am I up here
Surrounded by these strangers
Talking to this person
Who doesn't want his freedom
What on earth are his fears?
What are these fears?
I thought this was a party!

If this gets any stronger
Won't be able to walk alone
Sit and listen to these people
What can I do to get back home

Wanda lost her hundred dollars
Started yelling and freaking out
I hope the music gets louder and louder
Anything to drown her out

He was wild-eyed and nervous
Could never live in a city
There's too many freedoms
Can he really be so foolish?

Thank god this stuff is really pure
Tulips and helicopters
Strange people hide in the bushes
Your face is too many colors

Couldn't talk in the restaurant
Kept laughing when you opened your mouth
Felt like everyone was staring
We were fools to leave

I thought this was a party!

Helicopters and tulips
If this gets any stronger
Won't be able to walk alone
Helicopters and tulips

I won't be able to go back home
