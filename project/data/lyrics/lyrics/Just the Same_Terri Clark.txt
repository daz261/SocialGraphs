You could've walked a long back road
Or a lonely strech of beach
You could have sat there
On a park bench,a sunday
Paper at your feet
If you'd been waiting for a taxi
Or at a bus stop in the rain
I would've found you,I would've found you
Just The Same

You know you could've been a
Gambler,whose luck was running low
Or just another drifter without
A single place to go
You could have been a broken dreamer
Without a penny to your name
I would've loved you,I would've loved you
Just The Same

No it really didn't matter
Who who'd been or
What you'd done.Where we met
Or when It happened you'd still be the one

There's no way to know the future
But one thing will never change
I'm gonna love you,I'm gonna love you
Just The Same

I'm gonna love you,I'm gonna love you
Just The Same
