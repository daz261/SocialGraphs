Look who do I have to have and why
A city's child

Real mode
You have to talk about it
An old pro
Still we're 'bout it, 'bout it

Don't frown about it
It's best you keep it quiet
You could never lead a riot
Money don't make you a leader

Leaders usually read
Go read a book
He shaked then he shook
I need that crack

I need that crack
You're swingin' the pipe
Do what you like
Goin' "doom doom"

Reflect on the room
Reflect on your life
Go stab yourself with a knife

Reflect on your life
Time isn't real
How much time
Can you kill?

You can reflect on your life
Time isn't real
How much time
Can you kill?

Revenge isn't mine
It taught to hate from time
Time isn't real
How much time can you kill?

Luca Brazzi
He sleeps with the fishes
Fuck sugar and spice
And girls with deadly kisses

Purr like a cat
Raising towers
I go over her house
For the most

I got diamonds on suits
A girl's erased diamonds with new shoes
Remember Hollywood
You could finally make deals

Screamin', "Nigga, you can get these"
Stereotypical
Almost mythical
Like Mickey Mouse

I'll blow down your house
Blow up your whole image
Hardcore musicians with image

Love

You're silver screen
You're a hardcore lovin' machine
You play hardcore with me
And sooner or later we'll see

Reflect on your life
Time isn't real
How much time
Can you kill?

You can reflect on your life
Time isn't real
How much time
Can you kill?

You can reflect on your life
Time isn't real
How much time
Can you kill?

You can reflect on your life
Time isn't real
How much time
Can you kill?

You can reflect on your life
Time isn't real
How much time
Can you kill?

You can reflect on your life
Time isn't real
How much time
Can you kill?
