[Intro]
Go!

[Chorus]
Sick and sad again
Sometimes I'd like the rain to end
Sick and sad again
Sometimes I'd like to stand on my own two feet

[Verse 1]
Went to the corner of second and main
But there was somebody to mention
That they hoped it would rain forever, forever
So they could drown in peace
(Then I)

Went down to Hodgkin P.L
But there was nobody to answer
When I rang that doorbell forever, forever
Now I'm sad all the time

[Chorus]
Sick and sad again
Sometimes I'd like the rain to end
Sick and sad again
Sometimes I'd like to stand on my own two feet

[Verse 2]
Today was the day but she threw it all away
And I could never understand
'Cause she was never one to play by the rules
Of the game, her and me were so the same
(And I)

I try so hard and I never give in
And I am never satisfied
Until the day that I win against them
But I don't care, I'll follow her to anywhere

[Chorus]
Sick and sad again
Sometimes I'd like the rain to end
Sick and sad again
Sometimes I'd like to stand on my own two feet

(Lets go!)
Sick and sad again
Sometimes I'd like the rain to end
Sick and sad again
Sometimes I'd like to stand on my own two feet

Sick and sad again
Sometimes I'd like the rain to end
Sick and sad again
Sometimes I'd like to stand on my own two feet
Sometimes I'd like to stand on my own two feet
