Your eyes, your eyes are the windows of the soul
Don't you know?
And every time they look at me
It's a pleasure what they show

And do you wanna celebrate the light inside of me?
Real emotion for everyone to see
Song to sing with a sweet melody
Somethin' to believe in, tell you how I feel

Carry on that magic of the feeling you express
People will be happy if they have what you possess
It's the love in your eyes
Baby, it's the love in your eyes

And darling when I hold you, you give it back to me
I can't imagine anything that I would rather see
From the love in your eyes
Baby, it's the love in your eyes

The touch, the touch of your hand so fundamental
In my head, in my heart, in my soul healing on so many levels
It doesn't matter what we're going through
One thing with me is that I'll always love you

And don't change a thing, that's my advice
I'm singing about the sweetness you bring into my life

Carry on that magic of the feeling you express
People will be happy if they have what you possess
It's the love in your eyes
Oh baby, it's the love in your eyes, the love in your eyes

And darling, when I hold you, you give it back to me
I can't imagine anything that I would rather see
From the love in your eyes
Baby, it's the love in your eyes
The love in your eyes, oh baby

I know this love holds many changes
Not everyday will be a day without the past
Ah, don't you worry, just give it up to heaven
If we release control love will surely last
I want the people want to show your love will last
Ooh, baby, baby, baby love will last

I wanna celebrate the light I see
Real emotion between you and me
Song to sing with a sweet melody
Somethin' to believe in, I tell you how I feel

Carry on that magic of the feeling you express
People will be happy if they have what you possess
It's the love in your eyes
Baby, it's the love in your eyes

And darling, when I hold you, you give it back to me
I can't imagine anything that I would rather see
From the love in your eyes
I said I see the love in your eyes, the love in your eyes
The love in your eyes

Carry on that magic of the feeling you express
People will be happy if they have what you possess
It's the love in your eyes
Baby, it's the love in your eyes, is in your eyes
Darling, when I hold you, you give it back to me

 

Get up!

Ow!

Knock you out, yeah

Superhighways, coast to coast
Easy takin' anywhere
On the transcontinental overload
Just slide behind the wheel, how does it feel

(When there's no destination) That's too far
And somewhere on the way you might find out who you are

(Living in America) Eye to eye, station to station
(Living in America) Hand in hand, across the nation
(Living in America) Got to have a celebration

Rock my soul!

Smokestack, fatback
Many miles of railroad track
All-night radio
Keep on runnin' through your rock'n'roll soul

All-night diners
Keep you awake
On a black coffee
And a hard roll

(You might have to walk a fine line
You might take a hard line)
But everybody's workin' overtime

(Living in America) Eye to eye, station to station
(Living in America) Hand in hand, across the nation
(Living in America) Yeah, got to have a celebration

I live in America
I live in America
Wait a minute

You may not be lookin' for the promised land
But you might find it anyway
Under one of those old familiar names

Like New Orleans (New Orleans)
Detroit City (Detroit City)
Dallas (Dallas)
Pittsburgh P. A. (Pittsburgh P. A)

New York City (New York City)
Kansas City (Kansas City)
Atlanta, yeah (Atlanta)
Chicago and L. A

(Living in America)
Hit me (Living in America)
(Living in America)

I live in America
Staying alive, we'll make the prime
I live in America, hey
I know what it means
I

(Living in America) Eddie Murphy, eat your heart out
Hit me
Hey!

(Living in America) Eye to eye, station to station
(Living in America) So nice, would you better stop?
(Living in America) I feel good!
