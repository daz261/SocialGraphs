[Verse 1]
Juliet's trying
To find out what she wants, but she don't know
Experience has got her down
Well, look this direction
I know it's not perfection, it's just me
I want to bring you up again, now

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm losing what's left of my dignity
A small price I'll pay to see that you're happy
Forget all the disappointments you have faced
Open up your worried world and let me in

[Verse 2]
Juliet's crying
Well, now she's realizing love can be
Filled with pain and distrust
I know I am crazy
And a bit lazy, but I will try
To bring you up again, somehow

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm losing what's left of my dignity
A small price I'll pay to see that you're happy
Forget all the disappointments you have faced
Open up your worried world and let me in

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2]
Juliet's crying
Well, now she's realizing love can be
Filled with pain and distrust
I know I am crazy
And a bit lazy, but I will try
To bring you up again, somehow

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm losing what's left of my dignity
A small price I'll pay to see that you're happy
Forget all the disappointments you have faced
Open up your worried world and let me in

 

[Verse 1]
Dear mother, can you hear me whining?
It's been three whole weeks since that I have left your home
This sudden fear has left me tremblin'
'Cause now it seems that I am out here on my own
And I'm feeling so alone

[Chorus]
Pay attention to the cracked streets and the broken homes
Some call it slums, some call it nice
I want to take you through a wasteland I like to call my home
Welcome to paradise

[Verse 2]
A gunshot rings out at the station
Another urchin snaps and left dead on his own
It makes me wonder why I'm still here
For some strange reason it's now feeling like my home
And I'm never gonna go

[Chorus]
Pay attention to the cracked streets and the broken homes
Some call it slums, some call it nice
I want to take you through a wasteland I like to call my home
Welcome to paradise

[Verse 3]
Dear mother, can you hear me laughing?
It's been six whole months since that I have left your home
It makes me wonder why I'm still here
For some strange reason it's now feeling like my home
And I'm never gonna go

[Chorus]
Pay attention to the cracked streets and the broken homes
Some call it slums, some call it nice
I want to take you through a wasteland I like to call my home
Welcome to paradise

[Outro]
Oh, paradise
