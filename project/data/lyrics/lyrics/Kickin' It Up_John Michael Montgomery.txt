Pick you up on Friday
About half past 8
Just time for a movie
You can't stay out late
I take you home
A little kiss at the door
Lately I'm thinkin'
I want a little more
Tell your daddy
I'm a hard working man
And after church on Sunday
I'm gonna ask for your hand
If he don't like it
Well that's just tough
I've got to have your full time love

Your undivided lovin'
Is what I need
Twenty four hours a day
Seven days a week
This part time romance
It just ain't enough
I've got to have your full time love

Sunday afternoon
Finally rolls around
I get in my old truck
And I drive downtown
Your daddy's waitin'
He says I got bad news
I've got to tell you son
She's too good for you
What he don't know
Is when the sun goes down
We're gonna slip out that window
And we'll leave this town
Drive to Memphis
Tie this thing up
I've got to have your full time love

Your undivided lovin'
Is what I need
Twenty four hours a day
Seven days a week
This part time romance
It just ain't enough
I've got to have your full time love
This part time romance
Lord it just ain't enough
I've got to have your full time love
