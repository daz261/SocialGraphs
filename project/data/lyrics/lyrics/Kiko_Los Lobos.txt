My legs are tired
My face feels hot
Wake up Dolores
Please try to walk

Oh sacred night
Ocuiltin
Moyacatla

Our light is dim
We have so far to go
The stones are hard
On this endless road

Oh sacred night
On quetzal plumes
Of dying suns
And purple moons
Oh sacred night

As an eagle soars
Our spirits fly
To our gentle rest
Under loving sky

Oh sacred night
On quetzal plumes
Of dying suns
And purple moons
Oh sacred night

Ocuiltin
Moyacatla
Otlica
Auh in caltech

 

Broken window smile
Weeds for hair
Strolling 'round the corner
Like a millionaire

And the angels with dirty faces
Go it alone

With one shoe on
And one shoe lost
Stands a wounded man
Who just laughs it off

And the angels with dirty faces
Go it alone
And the angels with dirty faces
Go it alone

Lost a brother last night
To the howling wind
Find an empty doorway
It'll be back again

And the angels with dirty faces
Go it alone
And the angels with dirty faces
Go it alone
