Hometown sweetheart, hung around in the dark
Only make a move or two, I was just a young fool
Never been to night school, didn't know enough to be cool

So she found another lover, they went undercover
The way she stole my heart was a crime
In order to keep the peace callin' out the police
Find her 'fore I lose my mind

The woman I love done gone and left me, no
She's got a bad big record on the Heartbreak radio

A complete investigation, what's her destination
Did she leave a trace at all?
Book on her suspicion, just look at my condition
She left me here to take the fall

That girl she sure can play it rough, she oughta be in handcuffs
Make her wear a ball'n chain, oh, she's just a heart stealer
Sweetest kind'a love dealer, she knows how to flix a game

The woman I love done gone and Left me, no
She got a big bad record on the Heartbreak radio

Lonely hearts in distress, calling out an SOS
All across the U.S of A, come on back and serve your time
Right here in these arms of mine, Gotta have you home today
FBI, CID, help me, help me, help me please

The one I love has gone and left me alone
She got a bad big record on the heartbreak radio
The one I love has gone and left me alone
She got a bad big record on the heartbreak radio
The one I love has gone and left me alone
She got a big bad record on the heartbreak radio
She got a bag bad record on the heartbreak radio
