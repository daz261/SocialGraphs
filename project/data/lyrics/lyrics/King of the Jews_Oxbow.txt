My pretty my pretty
Your reddening ribbons
What the devil made me do
I did to you
I took sugar and spice
And ran it blue
And I know in this world
The wicked have a place

Angel Angel Angel
I was good for nothing
And even that was a bargain
For the garbage in your garden
But you know
You know
You must believe me when I say
I never meant
To harm you

But the road to hell
Is paved with good intention
And it seems like just yesterday
When I heard you mention
Your old man was coming home
And I had to leavе a while
Your old man was coming home
And I had to leavе awhile
I had to go

So I crept around
By the yellowing window
Watching the tale tattle
Not wanting to believe my eyes
Or listen to the whisper of my pistol
As another man took what I thought was Mine
I thought I’d die
So I crept around by the back
And I undid the latch
And with a firing iron in my hand
I made everything right
Wrong again
I shot him once

Oh pretty oh pretty
Your reddening ribbons
What the devil made me do
I did to you
I took sugar and spice
And ran it blue
And I know in this world
The wicked have a place

 

Build a fire
And stoke it with gasoline
And TNT
And the wicked poor flesh
And watch the careen
Into the baddest crash
You have ever seen

Watch while I smile
Because I love to love this
Life’s hot kiss
And its empty remembrance
Of what was not pain

“Who’s going to carry the platter that holds the head of John? The hammered silver shimmered; the snakes on its face were brilliant in a brilliant design crawling from under the head that was guilty of thе crime. And the scribes and thе scabs came and the old women and all the hags came to view in death, as in life John-of-Dreams quiet and nodding. And they made a smooth furrow a hollow hole his resting place. And they dumped his damp shroud after him and his old ruddy and robust had become pale and thin. The shriek in the thickets reduced to a whisper that echoed finally silent. The end was truly at hand as he said and above the crime and the penance was an inscription that read ‘Pass the strictest sentence’”

So light it up in black and blue
And Christmas green
And invite me in
And shoot me down
And curse this love like kindness
Because the smoke is always thick
In the love of God and blindness
Thick enough to make you sick
And sick enough to make you stop
