Jacqueline developed young
The boys just wanted her for fun
To get undone
But Jackie knew where she was from
She didn't want to be the one
To play it dumb

Jackie wants some medicine
To change the way she pulls 'em in
And knocks 'em down
She's too young to understand
The power that her body has
Over men

Don't bring her down, don't bring her down
Don't bring her down, don't bring her down

Jacqueline could win a crown
If only she would wear a gown
And play the game
The ladies of the hair salon
They can't keep from goin' on
About her ways

"Jackie don't know what she needs
She needs a big ol' house to clean
And a man to please
If only she could get some sense
And stop her sittin' on that fence
And dreamin' on"

Don't bring her down, don't bring her down
Don't bring her down, don't bring her down
Down... Down...
Don't bring her down, don't bring her down
Don't bring her down, don't bring her down
