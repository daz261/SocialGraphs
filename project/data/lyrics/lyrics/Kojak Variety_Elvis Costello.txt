[Verse 1]
Her lips are sweet
Her legs are big
Her looks can make you
Dance the jig
Her touch is so soft
Her heart is so warm
What knocks me out
Is your hidden charms

Her voice is so soft
Her love is so true
I think about her
That's all I do
She's weak and wanton
In my arms
What moves me, darling
Is your hidden charms

[Chorus]
When I hold you
In my arms
Brings out all of your
Hidden charms

[Verse 2]
Her kiss is so pure
As the morning dew
Her real gone love
Is exciting too
Her eyes that talk
They say "come on"
What kills me, baby
Is your hidden charms

Oh, my baby
Ooh

[Chorus]
When I hold you
In my arms
Brings out all of your
Hidden charms

 

It's hurting me
It's hurting me
This doubt is hurting me

So remove this doubt from my heart, little girl
And let me live my life knowing you care
Remove this doubt from my mind, little girl
And let me breathe again feeling my love is shared

Each time we meet
You make me feel so incomplete
There's no joy in the air
I just don't think you care

Close the door on doubt forever
And may it never more make me unsure
Turn the key and lock away this doubt in me
Keep it in the dark, not in my heart

Be more tender
Completely surrender
Your love to me
Is sweet and not discrete

Remove this doubt from my heart, little girl
And let me live my life knowing you care
Remove this doubt from my mind, little girl
And let me breathe again knowing my love is shared

Each time we meet
You make me feel so incomplete
There's no joy in the air
I just don't think you care

Remove this doubt from my heart
Remove this doubt from my heart
Remove this doubt from my heart
Remove this doubt from my heart
Remove this doubt from my heart
Remove this doubt from my heart
