[Chorus]
Come back darling
Give me another try
I'll make you satisfied
Come back darling
Give me another try
I'll make you satisfied

[Verse 1]
Don't you know, I need you badly
And I'll give my poor heart gladly
I need your love like roses need the rain
Don't let me cry in pain

[Chorus]
Come back darling
Give me another try
I'll make you satisfied
Come back darling
Give me another try
I'll make you satisfied

[Verse 2]
Can't you see the love's still burning?
Please return, relieve my yearning
A day without you is like a year of emptiness
Please return and bring me happiness

[Chorus]
Come back darling
Give me another try
I'll make you satisfied
Come back darling
Give me another try
I'll make you satisfied
Come back darling
Give me another try
I'll make you satisfied

[Outro]
Come back darling
Give me another try...
