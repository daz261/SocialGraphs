[Verse 1]
Little Johnny's sad and fucked
First, he jumped and then he looked
The tracks of time, those tracks of mine
Little Johnny's occupied

[Chorus]
Come on
Come together
Come on
Come together

[Verse 2]
Well, little Johnny had an ache
That hung around the poor boy's neck
Every time that Johnny ate
The little fucker fed the ache

[Chorus]
Come on
Come together
Come on
Come together

[Verse 3]
So little J's a fucked up boy
Who dulled the pain but killed the joy
And little J's a fuckin' mess
But when he's offered, just says yes
Little J is sad and fucked
First, he jumped and then he looked
The tracks of time, those tracks of mine
Little J is occupied

[Chorus / Outro]
Come on
Come together
