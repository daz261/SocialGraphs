[Verse 1]
There's a storm outside, and the gap between crack and thunder
Crack and thunder, is closing in, is closing in
The rain floods gutters and makes a great sound on concrete
On a flat roof, there's a boy leaning against the wall of rain
Aerial held high, calling, "Come on thunder, come on thunder"

[Chorus]
Sometimes, when I look deep in your eyes
I swear I can see your soul
Sometimes, when I look deep in your eyes
I swear I can see your soul

[Verse 2]
It's a monsoon and the rain lifts lids off cars
Spinning buses like toys, stripping them to chrome
Across the bay, the waves are turning into something else
Picking up fishing boats and spewing them on the shore

The boy is hit, lit up against the sky, like a sign, like a neon sign
And he crumples, drops into the gutter, cuts strange, legs twitching
The flood swells his clothes and delivers him on, delivers him on

[Chorus]
Sometimes, when I look deep in your eyes
I swear I can see your soul
Sometimes, when I look deep in your eyes
I swear I can see your soul

[Verse 3]
There's four new colors in the rainbow
An old man's taking Polaroids
But all he captures is endless rain, endless rain, endless rain
He says listen, takes my head and puts my ear to his
And I swear I can hear the sea

[Outro]
Sometimes, when I look in your eyes
I can see your soul, I can reach your soul
Sometimes, when I look in your eyes
I can see your soul, I can touch your soul
Sometimes, when I look in your eyes
I can see your soul, I can hear your soul
Sometimes, look in your eyes
I can see your soul
Sometimes, look in your eyes
I can see your soul
Sometimes, look in your eyes
I can see your soul
Sometimes, look in your eyes
I can see your soul

 

[Verse 1]
She dreamt the scene the night before
She cast you in her mind
She made your face from clay and straw
Precious stones for your eyes

[Verse 2]
We cut the cord that brought you here
We left you on your own
We filled your head with wild ideas
Our beliefs led you on

[Verse 3]
We leave a trail thats always changed
You keep your hopes alive
This surface may seem calm enough
But underneath, underneath

[Verse 4]
We made you feel the way you are is wrong
We made you what you are
You are afraid
If you dont play the game, well make you change

[Outro]
Oh, I've changed (Oh, I've changed)
Oh, I've changed (Oh, I've changed)
Oh, I've changed (Oh, I've changed)
Oh, I've changed (Oh, I've changed)
Oh, I've changed (Oh, I've changed)
Oh, I've changed (Oh, I've changed)
Oh, I've changed (Oh, I've changed)
I've changed
I've changed
