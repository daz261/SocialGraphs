[Verse 1]
Fallen angel
Head crashes dead
Out of control
Lost memories
Staircase twists
Darker rooms lit with left out toys
After playing
Men changes toys into tools
Twisted playthings on the staircase
Fools whose weapons represent the killing game

[Chorus]
Who taught the killing game
Who taught the killing game

[Verse 2]
Awaken
Eyes sewn wearing glasses dripping tap tap temple door
Locked inside
Scream inner scraping tooth and nail nowhere to go
Quiet retraces
Forcing light tears
Then pretend nothing blinds
Blinds closed in sanctuary
Closed in sanctuary
Padded walls
Quiet storm's fury burnt out killing time

[Chorus]
Who taught the killing game
Time's taught the killing game
Herself
No
I taught the killing game first

[Verse 3]
Passing words
Distant pains
Remember trains
Of thought collide
No one view window
Pushing faces through
Shards cold glass
Poke bloody holes
Exposed

[Chorus]
I taught the killing game first
I taught the killing game first

[Verse 4]
Tongue lash spewing red
Tortured animal
Wake up Time
Beckons death upon myself
Eyes travel harden
Strange no stronger feeling
Tempting motion slows to a crawl
Places his own foot in its own trap
Letting go
The springs that snap shut
Gazes show sharper teeth
Giving in to the jaws of death

[Chorus]
I taught the killing game
I taught the killing game first
I taught
I taught
I taught the game first
