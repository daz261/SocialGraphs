[Intro]
Check check check
One two

[Verse 1]
Spitting in a wishing well
Blown to hell, crash
I'm the last splash
I know you little libertine
I know you're a real cuckoo

[Chorus]
Want you cuckoo cannonball
Want you cuckoo cannonball
In the shade, in the shade
In the shade, in the shade

[Verse 2]
I know you little libertine
I know you're a cannonball
I'll be your whatever you want
The bong in this reggae song

[Chorus]
In the shade
In the shade
Want you cuckoo cannonball
Want you cuckoo cannonball

[Verse 3]
Spitting in a wishing well
Blown to hell, crash
I'm the last splash
I'll be your whatever you want
The bong in this reggae song

[Chorus]
Want you cuckoo cannonball
Want you cuckoo cannonball
In the shade, in the shade
In the shade, in the shade
