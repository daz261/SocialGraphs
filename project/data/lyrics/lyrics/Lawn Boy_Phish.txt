My sweet one, I'll call you my sweet one
You're my only true sweet one
With my all, I'll call you my sweet one
From far away, I'll say your name

Oh with you, I'd travel thick
And with you, I'd also travel thin
And all the spaces in between
I'd travel with you
You're my sweet one

But for now I must sit jail here and ponder the yonder
Herbivores ate well cause their food didn't never run

Oh, if you're ever unsatisfied with the way life's treating you
You know you can count on me to take good care of you
I love you honey oh yes I do you know that's true of course
And if your dog or cat ever dies, I'll buy you a ewe

 

In the mornin' I pack up my gear
And toss it in my carryall
Run the wide load to lip an'
Watch the big core crack an' glow

In the evening I undo my belt
Split open and melt

I wake up on my stomach
With my face between my hands
And crawl along the floor
Towards the doorway

Jumpin' to my feet
I try to pull myself together
But I feel it in my knees
And the room begins to spin

And I slip and bump my head
An' raise a welt
Split open and melt

We breathe deep in a steam dream
And plunge below the water line
Down down down melt

Between beams to the gloom room
Among the seaweed and the slime
Down down down melt
