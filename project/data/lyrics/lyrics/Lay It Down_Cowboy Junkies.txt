A candle burning for everything I've ever wanted
A tattoo burned for everything I've ever wanted and lost
I had a long list of names that I kept in my back pocket
But I've cut it down to one and your name's at the top

Won't you share a common disaster?
Share with me a common disaster
A common disaster

I found myself a friend but he's crooked as a stick in water
So now I'm writing fairy tales to catch the spirit of revenge
He's got a plan to steal my little sister
But I'm not too concerned 'cause I will get him in the end

Won't you share a common disaster?
Share with me a common disaster
A common disaster

Going to find me someone to share a common disaster
Run away with me from a life so cramped and dull
Not worry too much about the happily-ever-after
Just keep the Caddy moving 'til we're well beyond that hill

Won't you share a common disaster?
Share with me a common disaster
A common disaster
