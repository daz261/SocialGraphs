Look what you've done to me
Pushed me down and made me bleed
But I am up again and I'm out to
Avenge

I'll get you
Face down in the dirt
For what it's worth
Face down in the dirt
Blow by blow

You can't get away
Once I get my hands on you
I know what you've done
And I will make you pay

It's your just desserts
We'll put an end to what you began
We don't wanna die before we live
You're gonna regret that you have provked us
The tables turned and you have to face it
We arе the hunter - You are thе victim
We know where you are and we'll come get you

Look what you've done to me
Pushed me down and made me bleed
Yes I am up again
Stand my ground till the end

You'll choke on your own teeth
