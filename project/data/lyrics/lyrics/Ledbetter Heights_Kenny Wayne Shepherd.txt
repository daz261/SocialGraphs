Needles in my heart, spell on my mind
Your powerful potion gets me every time
I toss and turn, I can't sleep at night
Your kiss burns, through my dreams

Chorus:
Here it comes again
I don't stand a chance
Soul possession
Got me in a trance
Pullin' me back to you -
Deja voodoo

Fire in the dark, pounding in my brain
Driven by the chant calling out my name
I toss and turn, I can't sleep
Your kiss burns, through my dreams

[repeat first verse]

[repeat Chorus]

 

I was over in Aberdeen
On my way to New Orleans
I was over in Aberdeen
On my way to New Orleans
Well them Aberdeen women told me
They would give me my gasoline

Aberdeen is my home
But they just don't want me around
Aberdeen is my home
But they just don't want me around
I'm gonna take these women
Take them out this town

Well just look over yonder
Coming down the road
Well just look over yonder
Coming down the road
That must be my baby coming
Tell me she don't want me no more

Well there's too many women
I ain't never seen
Well there's too many women
I ain't never seen
I bring too many women
Back from New Orleans

I was standin' 'round cryin'
With my heart right in my hand
I was standin' 'round cryin'
With my heart right in my hand
I was lookin' for that woman
One ain't got no man

Well just look over yonder
Where we used to live
Well just look over yonder
Where we used to live
Don't you know it's killing me baby
How we can't live here no more

Well it's goodbye baby
If I'm never gonna see you no more
Well it's goodbye baby
If I'm never gonna see you no more
I'm gonna tell everybody youve been
Still knockin' at my door
