As the claws of dark spellbind me
And the light of the moon fills my eyes
I feel the presence even stronger
My invocation closer to rise

Terrors beyond the human mind
Awaiting me for thousands of years
Living in decay

Between the gates and then into the maze
Who was I to know
That I would be on my way to an early grave

They have taken my body
And control of the mental where there is no memories
They darkened the thoughts of the mind
I remember the times I wanted to travel beyond
I am the reason why it has been its good and its bad

They left me now
To shiver and cry like a child
They left me in humiliation
Unknowing, unknown where or when is to die

By the dark and mighty waters
I'm standing here alone
To hear and suffer my sentence
To pay the price I owe
I'm drowned

Terrors beyond the human mind
Awaiting me for thousands of years
Living in decay

Burning their teeth into my skin and my flesh
Into the maze of the ultimate judgment
I wish for only death

 

As your eyes are filled with horror
I lift up the corpse on the bench
You can't avoid the dismal sight
Its arms and legs I retrench

Excavating its interior
To get ahold of what's inside
And as I drivel and belch
You feel so damn reviled

I continue with laugther
I drink the bowel's rheum
Squeezing my hand through its mouth and further
Through its stomach to its womb

Of its once called body
There seems nothing to be left
And you better prepare yourself
For an equaling death

Revel in flesh

Pools of coagulated blood
And rotten flesh by my side
Now I really need something more
To kill another day in my life

 

Stubborn old, worthless hag
Simply had nothing to give
I couldn't stand your eternal nag
You didn't deserve to live

So I went to the stove and took a pork knife
And stabbed it into your head
Buried you in the fruit cellar
I was glad 'cause I thought you were dead

But the maggots didn't feast on your body
You didn't get moldy as I thought
And still I can hear that nag in my head
You were supposed to rot

Supposed to Rot

Now she haunts me, day and night
A haunting I can't forget
The deed was a coldblooded homicide
A murder I regret

But still she's the same old hag
And still my life has turned the same
Isn't there anything to set me free
From this wicked pain?

You were supposed to rot

 

Blinded eyes, crash course with reality
Subconscious lie, who did they really kill?
Shattered hope, a slave to his master
He starts thirsting for, the things he may never near

The falling tears, falling from your sorrow
You wonder why, they'll rip you all to shreds
Bomb the poor, if that's what living means to thee
They realize, that religion wants them dead

Imagine their emotion, for someone's need to kill
For some other religion but yours
It's just the death of your religion that makes you cry
It's just your own bitter loss

You

Blinded eyes, no more consolation
Subconscious lie, won't set you free
Your falling tears, our own extinction
Abandon stories, now everything can be seen

You're living out this lie, and the rest of you are blind
Can't you fucking see? subverted with a lie

Imagine their emotion, for someone's need to kill
For some other religion but yours
It's just the death of your religion that makes you cry
It's just your own bitter loss

It's just your own bitter loss
It's just your own bitter loss
It's just your own bitter loss
