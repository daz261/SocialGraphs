There are times I stand in wonder
To look at you and all you are
And I think I can unlock the mystery
Break through your walls and win your heart
I don't mean to scare you
There's no need to be afraid
We can take our time
But I'll take my chance and say

Let me love you, really love you
Open up your heart and let me in
I don't know who taught you not to trust
I'll be constant as the sun that shines above
Close your eyes and take the fall
If it's really love there's no risk at all
I can love you if you'll only let me in

I see your strength and how you shine
You're a diamond in the rough that should be mine
But you're still fighting an old war
That's left you wounded and left you scarred
You hide your weakness
Behind those walls
You think it's your own secret
But in your eyes I see it all

Let me love you, really love you
Open up your heart and let me in
I don't know who taught you not to trust
I'll be constant as the sun that shines above
Close your eyes and take the fall
If it's really love there's no risk at all
Lay down your past and then you can begin
To let me love you, really love you
I can love you if you'll only let me in
I can love you if you'll only let me in

 

Shut up and drive
You don't know what you're talking about
He's not the one
You ought to know that by now
You've got one of those hearts
That keeps changing your mind
Your heart has a way of making you stay
So shut up and drive

Don't look in the mirror
He might have that look in his eyes
The one that's so strong
It strangles your will to survive
He's mastered the art
Of looking sincere
His eyes have a way of making you stay
Don't look in the mirror

I'm the voice you never listen to
And I had to break your heart to make you see
That he's the one who will be missing you
And you'll only miss the man
That you wanted him to be

Turn the radio on
To drown out the sound of goodbye
Blink back the tears
Show me you've still got your pride
Just get yourself lost
In a sad country song
Those guys that they play
Know just what to say
Turn the radio on

I'm the voice you never listen to
And I had to break your heart to make you see
That he's the one who will be missing you
And you'll only miss the man
That you wanted him to be

Shut up and drive
Don't look in the mirror
Turn the radio on
Get out of here
Shut up and drive
Shut up and drive
Shut up and drive
