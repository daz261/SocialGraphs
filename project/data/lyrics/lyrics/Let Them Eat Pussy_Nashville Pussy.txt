Well I'm strutting around this one horse town
Drinking  beer and plotting revenge
Count  of four I'm out the door
Heading for a perfect binge

Go motherfucker go
Go  motherfucker go
Go  motherfucker go
Go, go

I  don't go to work, don't go to school
Don't do a goddamn thing
Sit on my ass, smoking bad grass
Telling everyone I was king

Go  motherfucker go
Go motherfucker go
Go motherfucker go
Go, go

Go, go, go

Strutting around this one horse town
Drinking beer and plotting revenge
Count of four I'm out the door
Heading for a perfect binge

Go motherfucker go
Go motherfucker go
Go motherfucker go
Go, go

Said, go, go, go

Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go
Yeah!
