I've been vindicated
I've been loved and hated
I've been pulled aside and told that life was overrated
No, I don't believe it
I just can't conceive it
I can write all night but in the morning I can't read it

Oh no, don't know what's the matter
Stuck up on a ladder, scared of coming down
If I don't get what I want
And there ain't enough to go around
I become oblivious to the obvious
Just ridiculous

As I flip the pages
You're a time that ageless
In between us lies a calm before the storm that rages
Though we were related
Couldn't be separated
Tried to get ahead but only got decapitated

If I don't get what you want
And you don't get what I need
We become oblivious to the obvious
Just dysfunctional
Shut down

When I can't get keep from getting down
And I grow tired of hangin' 'round
I become invisible, unlivable
Just dysfunctional
Shut down
