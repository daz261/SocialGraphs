[Verse 1]
Never fell in love until I fell in love with you
Never know what a good time was until I had a good time with you
If you wanna get the feeling and you wanna get it right
Then the music gotta be loud
For when the music hits I feel no pain at all

[Verse 2]
You know
Warm summer night I was drinking with my dad
He tried to give me the love that I never had
But he gave more love to his bottle of wine
So I had to go out and find love of another kind

[Chorus]
Here it is, here I am, turn it up, fuckin' loud
Radio, radio, radio, radio, radio, radio, radio
When I got the music, oh I got a place to go
Radio, radio, radio, radio, radio, radio, radio
When I got the music, oh I got a place to go

[Verse 3]
The Radio Clash, Magnificent 7
I was a choir boy, you showed me no heaven
Two tools surely lost
No remorse ignoring the cost

[Chorus]
Here it is, here I am, turn it up, fuckin' loud
Radio, radio, radio, radio, radio, radio, radio
When I got the music, oh I got a place to go
Radio, radio, radio, radio, radio, radio, radio
When I got the music, oh I got a place to go

Don't 'cha know?

[Chorus]
Here it is, here I am, turn it up, fuckin' loud
Radio, radio, radio, radio, radio, radio, radio
When I got the music, oh I got a place to go
Radio, radio, radio, radio, radio, radio, radio
When I got the music, oh I got a place to go

When I got the music, oh I got a place to go
When I got the music, oh I got a place to go
Oh I got a place, oh I got a place, oh I got a place to go
When I got the music, oh I got a place to go

When I got the music, oh I got a place to go
When I got the music, oh I got a place to go
When I got the music, oh I got a place to go
When I got the music, oh I got a place to go

 

[Chorus]
I had a dream I was a vigilante's side kick
My name is Tim, I'm a lesser-known character
I had a dream I was a vigilante's side kick
Fighting crime in the streets together

Down in Oakland, off of West Grand
St. Joseph relief, poor program
A good place where good people get food, yeah
Help your fellow man, a good thing to do, yeah
Government agency said, be afraid of me
I'll shut your doors down and it won't phase me
Wolverine came through, left the agent for dead
Opened up the doors back up, everyone was fed

[Chorus]
I had a dream I was a vigilante's side kick
My name is Tim, I'm a lesser-known character
I had a dream I was a vigilante's side kick
Fighting crime in the streets together

Do not bill them, abandoned buildings
It's nice to sleep when you got a ceiling
Neighborhood watch said, "we gotta put a stop, yeah
Can't have people livin' for free, call the cops, yeah"
Here comes the SWAT team and an M-16
They'll shoot the walls in, destroy the buildings
Wolverine was sad and it made him mad
Every single cop got a bullet in the head

[Chorus]
I had a dream I was a vigilante's side kick
My name is Tim, I'm a lesser-known character
I had a dream I was a vigilante's side kick
Fighting crime in the streets together
