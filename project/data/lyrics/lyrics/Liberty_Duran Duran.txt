[Verse 1]
Oh woman you make me feel
Like I'm on fire
Oh woman you make it real
It's the only way for me
So if we sometimes fight
Doesn't mean we got problems
Ain't always black and white
Who cares anyway?

[Chorus]
Ooh, doesn't have to be serious
Ooh, doesn't have to be serious
Serious
Doesn't have to be serious

[Verse 2]
Oh baby you get so wild
Too much understanding
Oh baby you're such a child
Full up with on love and tears and crying
Don't worry if you're confused
We all tend to be sometimes
The whole world is getting used
That's just the way it is

[Chorus 2][x2]
Maybe right, ooh it may be wrong
Doesn't have to be serious
Being hard isn’t being strong
Doesn’t have to be serious
Fighting for love, fighting for pain
Ooh, doesn’t have to be serious
And if you win, oh what do you gain
Doesn’t have to be serious
