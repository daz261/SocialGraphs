Look at the man with the smile on his face
Looks like he's always feelin' good
Sometimes you might want to take his place
And sometimes I think that you would

When the sun is goin' down
And there is no place to hide
Even in the brightest light
You might lean toward the darker side

Look at the people, they learn how to lie so easy
They learn how to lie to get what they need
And after they got what they needed
It turns into a simple case of greed

When they no longer feel ashamed
And they've lost all sense of pride
Misery loves company
And it's lonely on the darker side

And when the party is over
And the music has died
You'll be dancin' to the music, baby
Somewhere on the darker side

Somewhere on the darker side
