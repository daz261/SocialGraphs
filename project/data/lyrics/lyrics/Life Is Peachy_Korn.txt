[Verse 1]
Why can't I decide
Why my feelings I hide?
Always screwing with my mind
A thorn in my spine
Oh sure, it feels fine
Wasting all our time
In the back of my mind
A thorn in my spine

[Chorus]
Wait!
See it before my eyes!
Why?
Do I turn away?

[Verse 2]
Looking all the time
At your face so blind
Feeling uptight
Always the same fight
Hey man now decide
Go ahead take your time
Kissing all the time
That thorn in my spine

[Chorus]
Wait!
You cannot see inside!
Why?
Play yourself out that way!
Why?
You and me always hate!
Wait!
Weren't you my friend?

[Bridge]
Pain and rage and fear I feel!
Pain and rage and fear I feel!
Pain and rage and fear I feel!
Pain and rage and fear I feel!
Pain and rage and fear I feel!
Pain and rage and fear I feel!
Pain and rage and fear I feel!
Pain and rage and fear I feel!

[Verse 3]
Hey man look inside
Now you need your own life
Remember me guy?
That thorn in your spine
Waiting all the time
I'm doing mighty fine
Remember me guy?
The thorn in your spine

[Chorus]
Wait!
You cannot see inside!
Why?
Play yourself out that way!
Why?
You and me always hate!
Wait!
Weren't you my friend?

[Outro]
Wait you were my friend
Wait you were my friend
Wait you were my friend
Wait you were my friend
