Hey! Ho!
Hey! Ho!
Hey! Ho!
Hey! Ho!

[Verse 1]
Well I'm a crazy upsetter
(Driving me insane)
Yeah, I'm a streetwise professor
(Who am I to blame?)
Now, if you'd listen to the record
(Do you feel the same?)
Hell, it don't get any better
(Going backwards again)

Swing your fists, whack, stitches in the face
Fuck ups like me are just sorry that we're crazed
Never been like them within society
God protects me, feeling the banality

[Chorus]
Now my guns are blazin'
Bloodclot, I can see 360
And now my guns are blazin'
Picking back up and starting all over again

Hey! Ho!
Hey! Ho!
Hey! Ho!
Hey! Ho!

[Verse 2]
Well, I'm a bad motherfucker
(Driving me insane)
So don't you even bother
(Who am I to blame?)
'Cause when I listen to the record
(Do you feel the same?)
Hell, it don't get any better
(Going backwards again)

Read your words, I read your banner of hope
Well, I kick my way in, it seems to piss you all off
Well, I try to shut the gates, the walls are fading
I climb from the depths of hell unscathed

[Chorus]
Now my guns are blazin'
Bloodclot, I can see 360
Now my guns are blazin'
Picking back up and starting all over again

Hey! Ho!
Hey! Ho!
Hey! Ho!
Hey! Go!

[Chorus]
Now my guns are blazin'
Bloodclot, I can see 360
Now my guns are blazin'
Picking back up and starting all over again

[Outro]
Bloodclot
Oh, yeah
Well, I could see 360
I could see all around me
Ah, yeah
Na na na (Hey)
Na na na na na (Ho)
Na na na (Hey)
Na na na na (Ho)
Nu na na na na na (Hey)
Nu na na na na na (Ho)
Na na na na (Hey)
Na na na na na (Ho)
(Hey)
(Ho)
(Hey)
Well I can see 360 (Ho)
(Hey)
(Ho)
(Hey)
(Ho)

 

She's a Salvadorian immigrant, hear her through thin walls
A frail hooker, holding up corner walls
Gleaming sky scraper bunker he looked down
Laughed hysterically and L.A. spread around

On Hoover Street, the human spirit longs
And precious little could keep [?]
[?]
Her brother Mario got shot 4 times in the head

You see poor Mario, he caught a hot one
Through the lung, now he's done, so God bless him
And the cocaine moved through that system
Like a river forever winding

To the main body of the under class
Even disenfranchised kids don't wanna finish last
You see the market place will check the weight of the scale
You either get out and die or go to jail
And your best intentions splinter and frail
And a few weeks of promises and attempts to fail

It's a glass-pipe murder
Glass-pipe murder, oh yeah
Glass-pipe murder
It's a glass-pipe murder, oh yeah

Oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah

He takes a bottle of beer and it let up
Sipping things made Mario feel better
You see it falls on you and it falls on me
Self-annihilation, catastrophe

Two packs of cigarettes
For two dollars and seventy cents
And a bottle of wine that's been opened
And he said, "Why do I do this?"

A shiver through his body like a bottle of CC
Not encouraging reality to me
He said, "It's who I am, bring me back to it"
Off the deep end, [?]

You see, no one stood up and cheered for him
Everyone sat back waiting for something to happen
Again, to happen
It's an old schoolyard mystery
And the handcuffs bleed

It's a glass-pipe murder
Glass-pipe murder, oh yeah
Glass-pipe murder
It's a glass-pipe murder, oh yeah

Oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah

Who was the killer?
