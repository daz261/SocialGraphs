New shades on, look absolutely fine
Stroll down the main, all the passers by
No time all day, no i don't get none
I turn away frustrated disarrayed
Who have I to blame, leave me crying shame
Never to complain for you I will entertain I can't explain
These attempts they drain
But I can't give in all efforts will be spend in vain
Yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah
She got too much attitude
Yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah too much attitude
She's so fine but she's not mine what will I do, what will I say?
I want to understand try to be a man
I'm laughing at my problems as they come my way
New shades on, look absolutely fine
Stroll down the main, all the passers by
No time all day, no i don't get none
I turn away, this song is done
