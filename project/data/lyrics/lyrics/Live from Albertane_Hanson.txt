Lately we've been talking 'bout who we are
Seems we don't know anymore
And all this time that we've been thinking
At night I've been dreamin' about you

And I know you don't believe me when I say
I'll love you 'till the end forever and a day

I guess we'll never know (never know)
Exactly where this river's gonna flow
And I guess we'll never understand (oh)
Until we reach that promise land
So I guess we'll
I guess we'll never know

Well people say that we're sweethearts
They say nothing in the world can tear us apart
Well I don't know about you
But this thing we're going through is tearing me in two

And I know you don't believe me when I say
I'll love you 'til the end, forever and a day

And I guess we'll never know (we'll never know)
Exactly where this river's gonna flow
And I guess we'll never understand (understand)
Until we reach that promise land
So I guess we'll
I guess we'll never know

Yeah
Guess we'll never know, ooohhh
I guess we'll never know
Exactly where this river's gonna flow
And I guess we'll never understand
Until we reach that promise land
So I guess we'll
I guess we'll never know

I said I guess we'll never know
Exactly where this river's gonna flow
And I guess we'll never understand
Until we reach that promise land
So I guess we'll
I guess we'll never know
Yeah yeah yeah woah
