Used to think my life was charmed
Everything was grand
Well I was living like a king
But in a castle made of sand

All I took for granted
Was all I had to lose
Well I was reachin' for the brass ring
When I should've been holding you

Well I almost hit the big time
I almost had it all
Then you left me lonely near the top
That's a mighty long way to fall

I'm just barely gettin' by
It's the best that I can do
Well I almost hit the big time
Then I took a spill
It's been all downhill
Baby since I lost you

Well I thought you were so naive
When you said to me
Money does not matter
The best things in life are free

When you left I was riding high
But as soon as you weren't around
I found out how right you were
As it all came crashing down

Well I almost hit the big time
I almost had it all
Then you left me lonly near the top
That's a mightly long way to fall

I'm just barely gettin' by
It's the best that I can do
But I almost hit the big time
Then I took a spill
And it's been all downhill
Ya, I took a fall and I lost it all
Baby when I lost you
