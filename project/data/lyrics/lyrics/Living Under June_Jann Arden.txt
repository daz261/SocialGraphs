Can you see my heart beating in my mouth
Thank God the bones will keep it there inside
And you won't have to see this latest casualty
And you can get yourself away from
All my demolition love

Can you hear me laugh dazed and scared to death
Thank God my thoughts aren't drifting
Through the air
'Cause you would catch me there bound so
Tightly to your knees
The dirt beneath your feet is all I need
To be completely mad

Yeah hey hey
Yeah hey hey

Can you picture me here in Calgary
Thank God the voices screaming in my head
Would sooner wish instead than face the
Bitterness of loss
I can take it now I know myself in
Demolition love
Yeah hey hey
Yeah hey hey
Yeah hey hey

Can you see my heart
