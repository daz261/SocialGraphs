[Verse 1]
Love, love's a chameleon
Makes one-in-a-million
Feel like too much of the same
But leave, leave it behind you
And love will remind you
It was only you that changed

[Chorus]
Oh, I'd give all my dreams
Give up my home and everything
I've ever known to have you back again
To have you back again, to have you back again
I'd stand in the rain, no place to hide
Drown in my shame, swallow my pride
To have you back again, to have you back again

[Verse 2]
Time, time is a river
Flowing forever
Away from the sound of your heart
Only you can break this silence
Whisper forgiveness
Let me back into your arms

[Chorus]
Oh, I'd give all my dreams
Give up my home and everything
I've ever known to have you back again
To have you back again, to have you back again
I'd stand in the rain, no place to hide
Drown in my shame, swallow my pride
To have you back again, to have you back again

[Verse 3]
And I know I never loved you
Like you needed to be loved
But I know that I could learn to
If we both have faith enough

[Chorus]
Oh, I'd give all my dreams
Give up my home and everything
I've ever known to have you back again
To have you back again, to have you back again
I'd stand in the rain, no place to hide
Drown in my shame, swallow my pride
To have you back again, to have you back again

[Tag]
To have you, to have you, to have you back again
