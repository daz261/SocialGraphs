Let me tell you 'bout a friend of mine
He's a short order cook
Long on speed, short on spice
He reads his customers like a book
He's seen this, and he's done that
Now he's makin' fried eggs an art
But there's one thing he can't fix no how
There's a longing in his heart

He's tried for years to work it out
At the grill and at his home
Well he talks to his friends, talks to himself
He talks the chicken right off the bone
Talks to his woman and she understands
You know they're always eye to eye
She runs the joint, they live out back
Small house under a big sky
Well even the stars at night agree
The sky is falling apart
She knows cause she can feel it too
There's a longing in her heart

A longing in her heart
Longing in her heart

Well now you and me, we're just like them
We never wanted to be alone
So we made a pact, sealed with desire
For a happier house and home
Only to find it doesn't untie
The knot where feelings die
There's a longing deep inside our hearts
And no one to tell us why

Our friends aren't looking for anything new
They wouldn't know where to look
Well her, she likes running the joint
And he likes being a cook
Together they're doing very well
They're might glad they could
But there's a fire burning towards them now
Coming from a distant wood

And even the stars at night agree
That the sky is falling apart
We know 'cause we can feel it too
There's a longing in our hearts

 

Nobody else could make me happy
No one could hurt me like you do
You were the only one That mattered

Then you were gone...Love had moved on
Left me alone thinking of...

You...There was never any other
You...and I were created to be true

Isn't it Love that keeps us breathing
Isn't it love we're sent here for
Wasn't that love that we were feeling
(That was something baby)

Deep in our soul...Deeper than we know
Keeping me holding out for

You...There was never any question
You'll be forever on my mind

You and I, we were meant to be together
True hearts in a world where love is dyin'

And I might as well have been dyin' when
We were apart
When you came back I felt the beating of my heart

You...There was never any question
You'll be forever on my mind
You and I, we were meant to be together
You...and only you

It was you...only you
You...Always you
