The postmark read "asuncion"...

By the foul adriatic there can be some dramatic
Variations in the temperature
So you can't recall which s.s. dress to wear
But the king of the papists is a friend of the rapists
And the upside-down crucifixion squad
So escape from sure defeat is thus arranged

A man with your knowledge of electrical goods
Should not be condemned because he's misunderstood
Trip from zagreb to rome, and on to asuncion
In the clothes of a bishop, the new beard being your own

Chorus:
You may think we look stupid, but we're paying the rent
And we won't trade our fortunes for a hippy tent
We've been all colours of angels with both wings on the right
And we've supped and we've coupled through our mystic life

Eternal city, firm and true, no naked crimson lights
Constant like an anthrax bomb, honest like a knife...
All of this must never die
Popemobile to paraguay

It's been a while since you said "heil"
You cia-bred necrophile
No russkies left to rail at, not for now
But the slavs in their millions
With their scrapheaps of children
Must replace your south americans
More skulls to keep your mafia in the mafia top ten

They'll mass when commanded, they'll hate when they're told
They'll murder their neighbours for the good of their soul
They'll punish your enemies if you'll read out their names
They'll be adorning the bridges from the don to the thames--chorus

Cleansing faces of their smiles
Butchers sheltered and praised
Meeting pain with fairytales
Dead bank-balances raised
All of this must never die
Popemobile to paraguay

You may think we look stupid, but we're behind with the rent
How much am i bid for this real piece of jesus' polyester tent?
Polyester tent which my dad just sent
And it's lock up the women, burn this book for me, man
Send sweeties and flowers to teh-huh-ran
Lock up the women, burn this book for me, man
Send sweeties and flowers to my pal in tehran
In eye-ran
