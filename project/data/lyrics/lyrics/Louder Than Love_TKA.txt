I just don't know what this feeling is
It's such a funny feeling
I know I never felt this way before
And every time I'm near you
My fantasies just seem to take control
And each day I'm with you
The fire inside me grows and grows

And when I hold you in my arms
(Here in my arms)
I feel so strong inside
(So strong inside)
You have become such a part of me
Your love just won't set me free

[Chorus]
Because there's something in my heart
Something in my heart
Is telling me you're the one
Something in my heart
Something in my heart
Is telling me you're the one I need

I just can't go on pretending I'm not in love
Each day of my life, each and every minute
You're the one I'm thinking of
And when we're alone
Nothing else matters but you and me
And I know together
Come what may, we can face anything

And when I hold you in my arms
(Here in my arms)
I feel so strong inside
(So strong inside)
You have become such a part of me
Your love just won't set me free

[Chorus]
Because there's something in my heart
Something in my heart
Is telling me you're the one
Something in my heart
Something in my heart
Is telling me you're the one I need

And when I hold you in my arms
(Here in my arms)
I feel so strong inside
(So strong inside)
You have become such a part of me
Can no longer hide
That there's something in my heart

[Chorus]
Something in my heart
Something in my heart
Is telling me you're the one
Something in my heart
Something in my heart
Is telling me you're the one I need
(You're the one I need)

Something in my heart
Something in my heart
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Is telling me you're the one
Something in my heart
Something in my heart
(You see, there's something in my heart)
Is telling me you're the one I need
(It says that you're the one)

Something in my heart
Something in my heart
(Something, something)
(Something, something)
Is telling me you're the one
Something in my heart
Something in my heart
Is telling me you're the one I need
