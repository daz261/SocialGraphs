[Verse 1]
I wanna go higher, higher, set it free
There's gotta be more to touch than what I see
There's a reason we must be
For the love of God, speak it to me

[Chorus]
Good news for the modern man (Yes, it is)
Made by the creator's hands (Yeah, he is)
Confirmed just who I am
Here I stand, the forever man

[Verse 2]
It's gotta be higher, higher, let it be
Carry on from this life's brevity
When this mortal coil is twisting (Twisting)
With the love of mercy, carry me

[Chorus]
Good news for the modern man (Yes, it is)
Made by the creator's hands (Yeah, he is)
Confirmed just who I am
Here I stand, the forever man

[Bridge]
Sometimes we lose our sight
Open our eyes
No secret here
Heaven is near

[Chorus]
Good news for the modern man (Yes, it is)
Eternity in the heart of every man
Confirmed just who I am
Here I stand, the forever man

[Outro]
And the longer I live
The stronger I feel a creator put us here
And the day will come, gravity will run
And we'll meet you in the air
Where face to face we will wonder
As the mysteries come undone
And at the end of all our travels
We find our journey's just begun
Here I stand
It's who I am
Here I stand
Forever man
