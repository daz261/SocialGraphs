I walked down to the river
Stood on the shore
Seems like the devil's always
Tryin' to get in my door
Just when I thought I couldn't
Take any more
Here he comes again
My friend

He keeps sending me angels
From up on high
He keeps sending me angels
To teach me to fly
He keeps sending me angels
Sweet and true
He keeps sending me angels
Just like you

As I stand on this mountain
Face to the wind
Amazed at the number of
Times we've all sinned
And the countless enemies
That should've been friends
Oh, here he comes again

And he keeps sending me angels
Here they come a flyin'
He keeps sending me angels
To keep me from cryin'
He keeps sending me angels
So I won't be blue
He keeps sending me angels
Just like you

Some say that it's comin'
I say it's already here
The love that's among us
Through the joy and the fear
When I look in your eyes
Everything is so clear
My friend, here he comes again

He keeps sending me angels
From up on high
He keeps sending me angels
To teach me to fly
He keeps sending me angels
Sweet and true
He keeps sending me angels
Just like you

Sending me angels
From up on high
He keeps sending me angels
To teach me to fly
He keeps sending me angels
Sweet and true
He keeps sending me angels
Just like you
