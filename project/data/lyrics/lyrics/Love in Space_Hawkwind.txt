In the back of my neck I can feel a strange sensation
Feels like I'm heading for the crisis of all creation
Only those with death wish understand my situation
Feel like Jesus Christ heading for the Stations of the Cross
In my death trap, death trap
Running in my death trap, death trap
Chicken running in my death trap, death trap
Chicken running in my death trap, death trap

Cruising for the crossroads of fiery crucifixion
Lighting up the night sky with bitterness distinction
While I hold the wheel of fate, smell of burning friction
I feel like a hero heading for extinction
In my death trap, death trap
Running in my death trap, death trap
Chicken running in my death trap, death trap
Chicken running in my death trap, death trap

It's the shell of steel or plastic
Monkey on elastic, going up and down
Monkey on elastic, going up and down
I've been down

Crank shaft cracking up
Oil pressure going down
Brake drums blowing out
Tyres on fire now
Differential seize up
Unbalanced camshaft
Worn out pistons rings
Brake fade, brake fade
Hydraulic leak out
Radiator overheat
Monkey on elastic, going up and down
Monkey on elastic, going up and down
Shell of steel or plastic, turning round
Shell of steel or plastic

In the back of my neck I can feel a strange sensation
Feels like I'm heading for the crisis of creation
Only those with death wish understand my situation
Feel like Jesus Christ heading for the Stations of the Cross
In my death trap, death trap
Running in my death trap, death trap
Chicken run, death trap, death trap
Running in my death trap, death trap
Chicken run, death trap, death trap
Death trap, death trap, death trap
Death trap, death trap, death trap
Death trap, death trap, death trap
Death trap, death trap, death trap
Death trap, death trap, death trap
Death trap, death trap, death trap
Death wish
