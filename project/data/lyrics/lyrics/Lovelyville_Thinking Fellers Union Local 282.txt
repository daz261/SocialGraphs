[Instrumental]

 

I'm on the inside
It takes a nail in the head to make him understand
That the shortest way there is the one he can see
But it gives him something to do

See that guy
He's a lot like me
He's a lot like me
He's dumb as hell

See that guy
He's a friend of mine
He's a friend of mine
He's dumb as hell

Put on ice again this time...
Put on ice again this time for good

I'm on the inside
The shortest way there is the one I avoid
I take my time and make sure that it lasts
I don't want to get there too soon

See that guy
He's a lot like me
He's a lot like me
He's dumb as hell

See that guy
He's a friend of mine
He's a friend of mine
He's dumb as hell

Put on ice again this time...
Put on ice again this time for good
