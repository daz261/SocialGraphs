[Intro]
"I'll be practicing in my mind"

Wha-da-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-baaa
Whoa-oh-oh
Catch the vibes... the reggae and the ragtime
Whoa-oh-oh
Catch the vibes, catch the vibes
Whoa-oh-oh
'Cause it's Lucas with the lid off
Catch the vibes, catch the vibes
Whoa-oh-oh
'Cause it's Lucas with the lid off
Zem, Zem
DaZem, Zem
DaZow, Zem

Watch me now you hear me now
Watch me go-oh

[Bridge]
Whatever bubbles, bubbles up... (I feeeeeel)
Come follow me around come follow me now (yeah, yeah-eah)
Whatever bubbles, bubbles up... (I feeeeeel)
Come follow me around come follow me now (yeah, yeah-eah)
Whatever bubbles, bubbles up... (I feeeeeel)
Come follow me around come follow me now (yeah, yeah-eah)
Whatever bubbles, bubbles up... (I feeeeeel)
Come follow me around come follow me now (yeah, yeah-eah)

I feeeeeel... so good

Zow, zow, zow

Watch me go-oh

[Verse 1: Lucas]
Strike the right chord, and I rap, rap my skull cap
Electric, until I blow my top off
I wrap my lyrics right around the globe
I lay lobes and all
Bit by bit I make it fit
'Cause I'm here to knit myself together
And whatever split for my format
And after that
I never stay the same
And treat the freak like a doormat
Jump around on it
I'm here to spray poetic confetti already
Open open open up your skull cap
And let it rain, let it rain, let it rain
Let it drain

All the I'm-too-cool-to-have-a-good-time-
But-really-I'm-a-muted-trumpet type of talkaway
Hey-ey-ey
Move to the front, take it off, take it off
Catch the vibes
'Cause it's Lucas with the lid off

[Chorus]
Catch the vibes, catch the vibes
Whoa-oh-oh
'Cause it's Lucas with the lid off
Catch the vibes, catch the vibes
Whoa-oh-oh
'Cause it's Lucas with the lid off
Zem, Zem
DaZow, Zow
Skedadle-lah-ooh
Watch me now you hear me now
Uh now, now, now

[Bridge]
Whatever bubbles, bubbles up... (I feeeeeel)
Come follow me around come follow me now (yeah, yeah-eah)
Whatever bubbles, bubbles up... (I feeeeeel)
Come follow me around come follow me now (yeah, yeah-eah)
Whatever bubbles, bubbles up... (I feeeeeel)
Come follow me around come follow me now (yeah, yeah-eah)
Whatever bubbles, bubbles up... (I feeeeeel)
Come follow me around come follow me now (yeah, yeah-eah)

I feeeeeel... so good
I feeeeeel... so good

[Verse 2: Lucas]
Welcome to my brain, I got the lid off
My chest I got my nut off
The type of spirit that can break your framework
The same by the end will stay the same
Hear the voice of summer
Zow za zow zow
But once I gotta hum a melody
That represents the type of flow I kick
When my tongue is swingin' like a drumstick
Of a jazzy type of lick
Everybody's got the lid on tightly
Afraid of what might be lurking right behind
And out of safety
So undo yourself and watch my rhyme go
Out of my lyrical chimney
But don't repeat my voice to the beat

When you hear the track again make up your own words
'Cause the rhythm is a conduit to break a split from the homegrown
The well known is on to the unknown
See everyone's a firecracker like a phone about to get hooked up
And let look up and let look up and let whatever bubbles up
Out your head spread the vibes and illuminate the sky

'Cause it's lucas with the lid off
It's Lucas with the lid off
It's Lucas with the lid off
Come on and take your lid off

Watch this
Watch me now you hear me now

Take a solo , take a solo
And spread the vibes kid

[Break]

I hear that funky tune
Now now now now
Now now
Whooooooooooo
Spread spread spread the vibes
Spread it spread it
Now-now now-now now-now now-now
Watch this
Mm-mm
Ah bap bap bap bow

Watch me now you hear me now

Uh now, now, now

[Bridge]
Whatever bubbles, bubbles up... (I feeeeeel)
Come follow me around come follow me now (yeah, yeah-eah)
Whatever bubbles, bubbles up... (I feeeeeel)
Come follow me around come follow me now (yeah, yeah-eah)
Whatever bubbles, bubbles up... (I feeeeeel)
Come follow me around come follow me now (yeah, yeah-eah)
Whatever bubbles, bubbles up... (I feeeeeel)
Come follow me around come follow me now (yeah, yeah-eah)

I feeeeeel... so good
I feeeeeel... so good
Lid off
Zem, Zem
DaZem, Zem
DaZow, Zem

Watch me now you hear me now
Watch me go-
Catch the vibes, catch the vibes
Whoa-oh-oh
'Cause it's Lucas with the lid off
Catch the vibes, catch ta-oh-oh
'Cause it's Lucas with the lid off

Zem, Zem
DaZow, Zow
Skedadle-lah-ooh
Watch me now you hear me now
