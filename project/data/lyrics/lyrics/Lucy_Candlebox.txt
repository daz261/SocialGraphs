Turn me into, another corner
You see I'm sideways, I'm unopened
I let it before I lose myself, I'm empty and inspired alone
And I swear, I can say to you
And I swear, I can say to you
So I write it down, and slip away from faith
Frustrated and anxious to grow
Addressed in clothes that never fit my mind
Letters said but never closed last time
And I can say to you
And I swear, I can say to you
You tell me...
When did we start to drown
You see I'll hold you there
When did we start to drown
Can't you see it's time we made it home
When did we start to drown?
When did we start to...
So I see you turn it into your lines my way
You see I'm angry, and I'll set you straight
Let it before I lose control
You find out, and I'll fight it alone
And I swear, I can say to you
And I swear, I can say to you
Somebody tell me
When did we start to drown
You think I'll hold you there
When did we start to drown
Can you see it's time we made it home
When did we start to drown?
Always on my mind, time for your temper
Always on my mind, sent to my mind I know
Always on my mind, I'll hold your thoughts I swear, always...
So you turn to me, so you turn it...
Turn me into another corner
And you put me in this, this other corner
Turn it into another corner
You'll tell me...
When did we start drown
You see I'll hold you there
When did we start to drown
Can't you see it's time we made it home
When did we start to
Drown??
