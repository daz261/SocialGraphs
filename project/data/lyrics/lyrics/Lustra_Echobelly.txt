Save your point of view
For the manic charm that he puts you through
When he wears your pearls, your ruby dress
And he looks so good with his sunken chest
There's a certain charm
To the pretty boy that is on my arm
He's my double friend, a boy and a girl
When he says:

Paint my face, lick your mouth
Fake a yawn and we'll go out and glow
We're on our way to somewhere in particular
I'll take you somewhere, where you haven't been
And I'll show you a good time, like you've never seen
Here comes the big rush

There's a special ring
To his Cuban heels and his six-pack swing
His mother's clothes are his new disguise
And his good advice when he says:

Vanity's a virtue, lets no one in to hurt you
I'll take you somewhere, where you haven't been
And I'll show you a good time, like you've never seen
Here comes the big rush

You're one of the boys
Pump that pipe dream, sell you something
New, new, new
We're on our way to somehwere in particular
I'll take you somewhere, where you haven't been
And I'll show you a good time, like you've never seen
Here comes the big rush

You're one of the boys
Pump that pipe dream, sell you something
Pump that pipe dream, sell you something
New new
