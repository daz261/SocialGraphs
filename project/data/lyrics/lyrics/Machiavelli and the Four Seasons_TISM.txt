[Verse 1]
I met a member of Generation Next
"Hey, what's in with you kids these days?
I'm so old, I'll probably never have heard of it"
And he replied, "Purple Haze
Purple Haze, Purple Haze"

[Verse 2]
Now, I know that we should seperate our garbage
The enviroment willl give us thanks
It's going too far when teenagers recycle
Their parents adolescent angst

[Chorus]
Do you want to save the world?
Well, don't recycle, don't recycle
Do you want to save the world?
Well, don't recycle, don't recycle

[Bridge]
Monday night is '50s night
Tuesday night is '60s night
Wednesday night is '70s night
Friday night is Thursday night

[Verse 3]
Paul McCartney once said the Sex Pistols
Were another band playing Chuck Berry
At the time I thought, "You boring old wanker"
(Now, I think it's downright scary)

[Chorus]
Do you want to save the world?
Well, don't recycle, cycle, cycle
Do you want to save the world?
Well, don't recycle, cycle, cycle
Garbage!
Don't recycle, cycle, cycle
Garbage!
Don't recycle, cycle, cycle
