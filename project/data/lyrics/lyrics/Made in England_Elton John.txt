[Verse 1]
I was made in England
Out of Cadillac muscle
I had a quit-me father
I had a love-me mother
I had Little Richard
And that black piano
Oh, that sweet Georgia Peach
And the boy from Tupelo

[Chorus]
Woh oh oh oh, I was made in England
Woh oh oh oh, I was made in England

[Verse 2]
I was made in England
Out of Cadillac muscle
Face down on a playground
Crying, 'God, send me a brother'
Not a bloody nose
For rock 'n' roll
Give me that sweet Georgian Peach
And the boy from Tupelo

[Chorus]
Woh oh oh oh, I was made in England
Woh oh oh oh, I was made in England
Yeah!

[Verse 3]
I was made in England
Like a blue Cortina
But a Yankee summer
Had a way about her
You had a scent for scandal
Well here's my middle finger
I had forty years of pain
And nothing to cling to

[Chorus]
Woh oh oh oh, I was made in England
Woh oh oh oh, I was made in England

[Bridge]
If you're made in England
You're built to last
You can still say 'homo'
And everybody laughs
But the joke's on you
You never read the song
They all think they know
But they've all got it wrong

[Chorus]
Woh oh oh oh, I was made in England
Woh oh oh oh, I was made in England (sing it!)
Woh oh oh oh, I was made in England
Woh oh oh oh, I was made in England
Yeah!

[Outro]
I
Was
Made
In
England!

I
Was
Made
In
England!

I
Was
Made
In
England!
Yeah, yeah!
Yeah, oh
Oh
I was made in England
Whoa, rock on, boy, yeah
Hey

 

[Verse 1]
This is my house
This is where I live
That is the winter
Those are the trees
I can hear them breathe

[Chorus]
This is my bed
This is where I sleep
That was the dark
Those are my dreams
They belong to me

[Verse 2]
This is my floor
This is where I lie
This is a square room
That was a bright light
These are not my eyes
What is my soul
Where is my tired heart
That is the question
Where is the answer
Inside my house
And I sit by the window
And I wish I was rain
I want to fall from the sky
I want to get wet all over again
Because this my house
It belongs to me
Inside my head
It's all that's left
This is my house

[Chorus]

[Outro]
This is my house[x4]
