[Intro]

[Verse 1]
I'm taking my ride with destiny
Willing to play my part
Living with painful memories
Loving with all my heart

[Chorus]
Made in heaven, made in heaven
It was all meant to be, yeah
Made in heaven, made in heaven
That's what they say
Can't you see?
That's what everybody says to me
Can't you see?

[Post-Chorus]
Oh I know, I know, I know that it's true
Yes, it's really meant to be
Deep in my heart

[Verse 2]
I'm having to learn to pay the price
They're turning me upside down
Waiting for possibilities
Don't see too many around

[Chorus]
Made in heaven, made in heaven
It's for all to see
Made in heaven, made in heaven
That's what everybody says
Everybody says to me
It was really meant to be
Oh, can't you see?
Yeah, everybody, everybody says
Yes, it was meant to be

[Post-Chorus]
When stormy weather comes around
It was made in heaven
When sunny skies break
Through behind the clouds
I wish it could last forever, yeah
Wish it could last forever, forever

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Made in heaven
I'm playing my role in history
Looking to find my goal
Taking in all this misery
But giving in all my soul

[Chorus]
Made in heaven, made in heaven
It was all meant to be, yeah
Made in heaven, made in heaven
That's what everybody says
Wait and see, it was really meant to be
So plain to see
Yeah, everybody, everybody
Everybody tells me so
Yes, it was plain to see
Yes, it was meant to be

[Outro]
Written in the stars
Written in the stars
Written in the stars

 

[Freddie Mercury]
Three, four

[Intro]
Take a peace of my heart
Ooh ooh, take a piece of my soul
(Ooh, ooh) Let me live
Oh yeah

[Verse 1]
Why don't you take
Another little piece of my heart?
Why don't you take it
And break it and tear it all apart?
All I do is give, all you do is take
Baby, why don't you
Give me a brand new start?

[Chorus]
So let me live (so let me live)
Let me live (leave me alone)
Let me live, oh baby
And make a brand new start

[Verse 2]
Why don't you take
Another little piece of my soul?
Why don't you shape it
And shake it 'til you're really in control?
All you do is take, all I do is give
All that I'm askin' is a chance to live

[Chorus]
(So let me live) so let me live
(Leave me alone) let me live, let me live
Why don't you let me
Make a brand new start

[Verse 3]
And it's a (long hard struggle)
But you can always depend on me
And if you're (ever in trouble) hey!
You know where I will be

[Verse 4]
Why don't you take
Another little piece of my life?
Why don't you twist it
And turn it and cut it like a knife?
All you do is live, all I do is die
Why can't we just
Be friends, stop livin' a lie?

[Chorus]
So let me live (so let me live)
Let me live (leave me alone)
Please let me live
(Why don't you live a little)
Oh yeah baby
(Why don't you give a little love?)

[Guitar solo]

(Go for it, baby)

[Verse 5]
Let me live
Please let me live
Oh yeah baby, let me live
And make a brand new start

[Verse 6]
In your heart, oh baby
(Take another piece)
(Take another piece
Take another piece)
Please let me live
(Take another piece)
(Take another piece
Take another piece)
Oh, why don't you
Take another piece
(Take another piece of my heart)

[Outro]
Oh yeah baby
Make a brand new start
Oh baby, baby
Oh baby, baby
Baby, Baby
All you do is take
(Let me live) Ooh ooh, let me live
(Oh yeah, yeah) Let me live
