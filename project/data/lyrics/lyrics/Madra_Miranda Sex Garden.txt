While joyful springtime lasteth
Each thing of pleasure tasteth
And with delights abound
Fa la la
The birds so sweetly singing
The flowers so freshly springing
With nature's beauty crowd'd
Fa la la

 

Though philomela lost her love
Fresh note she warbleth yet again
Fa la la
He is a fool that lovers prove
An leaves to sing and live in pain
Fa la la
