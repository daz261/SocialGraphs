Compared to what you do
I've seen nothing of you
Compared to what you say
Your words just fall through the day
Idle words on their way

Compared to where you've been
And all these images you've seen
Compared to what you feel
You don't feel nothing that's real
Let the light you shine reveal

It's good to know that
You want me there
And I'd like to show that

You want me there
And we like to show that
We need you there
It's good to care

When you say the words
That we are longing to hear
When you get to see
What your loving does to me
Set my river running free

Compared to what you do
Comapared to what you do

The treasure that you bring
Makes my heart want to sing
All the things you do
Reflect this image deep in you
So let the love you've got shine through

It's good to know that
You want me there
And I'd like to show that
It's good to care
And it's good to know that
You want me there
And we'd like to show that
It's good to care

 

The warth of the sun, it feels healing
Warming the cold in my mind
An ocean of space sends me reeling
Easing my passage through time
Leaving it all behind

When she is gone she is gone
And when she fjust falls she just falls
Far too long

Cool of the shade feels relieving
Cracks thats appear in my hide
The key to the day is withstanding
Kingdoms that fall and rise
Leaving it all behind

When she is gone she is gone
And when she falls she just falls
Far too long

Falls way beyond
Falls where she belongs
Falls way beyond
Falls where she belongs
