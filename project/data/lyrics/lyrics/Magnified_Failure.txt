Sometimes, pear-shaped women melt down
Onto concrete
Splashing sun and sidewalk insects
Down by these feet

Sometimes, puddles terrify me
As they gaze up
Scrap of paper floating, crumpled
I can't pick up
Goodbye

No one's ever gonna find out
From this shut mouth
Just be sure to keep these eyes closed
They can read those

Sometimes, people use their sound holes
Pointed at me
Rusty winds groaning down alleys
Blow right past me

Sometimes, pipes creaking inside here
Know me too well
Flesh and steel I had carved up
For a farewell
Too late

No one's ever gonna find out
From this shut mouth
Just be sure to keep these eyes closed
They can read those

I'll never
Wish for it
But now, it grows inside
Just like a moth

No one's ever gonna find out
From this shut mouth
Just be sure to keep these eyes closed
They can read those

No one's ever gonna find out
From this shut mouth

 

Sent away to have my head checked
No more playing in the sand
Frogs are leaping off my brain stem
They don't seem to understand

Roadside blurs against a big bus
Face is slouched against the glass
I am headed for a cleansing
In a room without a bath

Didn't it seem kind of silly?
The way the doctors carried on, so uptight

It's not bad being so distant
I can live inside the gap
Frogs are hopping off my brain stem
So excited to be sane

Didn't it seem kind of silly?
The way the doctors carried on, so
Now that I've become a monster to them
I'll have to keep their fear turned on all night long

I've gone away to have my head checked
I guess I need to have it looked at
I've gone away to have my head checked
I guess I need to have it looked at

I've gone away to have my head checked
I guess I need to have it looked at
I've gone away to have my head checked
I guess I need to have it looked at

I've gone away to have my head checked (so long)
I guess I need to have it looked at (so long)
I've gone away to have my head checked (so long)
I guess I need to have it looked at (so long)
