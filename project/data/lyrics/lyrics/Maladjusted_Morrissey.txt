[Verse 1]
So, the choice I have made
May seem strange to you
But who asked you, anyway?
It's my life to wreck
My own way

[Chorus 1]
You see to someone, somewhere, oh yeah
Alma matters
In mind, body and soul
In part, and in whole
Because to someone, somewhere, oh yeah
Alma matters
In mind, body and soul
In part, and in whole

[Verse 1]
So, the life I have made
May seem wrong to you
But, I've never been surer
It's my life to ruin
My own way

[Chorus 1]
You see to someone, somewhere, oh yeah
Alma matters
In mind, body and soul
In part, and in whole
Because to someone, somewhere, oh yeah
Alma matters
In mind, body and soul
In part, and in whole

[Chorus 2]
To someone, somewhere, oh yeah
Alma matters
In mind, body and soul
Part, and in whole
So to someone, somewhere, oh yeah
Alma matters
In mind, body and soul
Part, and in whole

[Outro]
To someone, somewhere, oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah
