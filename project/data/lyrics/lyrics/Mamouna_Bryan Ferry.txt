Too fast to live
Too young to die
One stolen kiss babe
A certain smile

We never close babe
We dance all night
I'm lost inside babe
Your painted smile

The name of the place
The name of the place

You'll never know babe
The state I'm in
It's a plastic world babe
No tiger skin

Don't talk to me (don't talk to me)
Your perfume sighs
I'm lost inside babe
Your painted smile

Painted
Painted
