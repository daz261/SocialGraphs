I don¹t care if you don¹t like the way I look
Can¹t you see this ain¹t no Sunday School
I don¹t really care about your in Rn¹ outs
Can¹t you see I ain¹t nobody¹s fool
What is this, what is that
I don¹t care how you wear your hat
Leave me alone
Leave me alone
Why don¹t you free me
And leave me alone
I don¹t care if you don¹t want me in your house
I just come Rn¹ go as I please
You can sing your song about when you were young
I can start a war when you want peace
Close the door, just ignore
But you won¹t tie me down no more
Leave me alone
Leave me alone
Why don¹t you free me
And leave me alone
Leave me alone
Leave me alone
Why don¹t you free me
And leave me alone
I don¹t care if you don¹t like the way I walk
You don¹t stop and listen when I talk
I can see that you don¹t want to understand
Playing in a rock Rn¹ roll band
You object, you expect
But you don¹t give me no respect
Leave me alone
Leave me alone
Why don¹t you free me
And leave me alone
Leave me alone
Leave me alone
Why don¹t you free me
And leave me alone
