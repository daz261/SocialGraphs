I know just what your thinking
You want someone to blame
I know you well 'cause
I always feel the same

We always look behind
We always look behind
Day in, day out
The world is my witness
Sick from my culture's sickness
Wish it would all go away
You feel the same
We always look behind
We always look behind
I want to slow my mind, down

Something tells me
It's my cross to bear
You can't reach me
You were never there
It's like water
Under a bridge now
I've looked a thousand times
We always look behind
We always look behind
Day in, day out
