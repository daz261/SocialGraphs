Fun in the manscape
It's coming apart
The soul is for hire
And they've sold the heart
Operate the radar
Hit the switches
Try to find a way to live
Please by the brochure

Life in the manscape
It's part of the deal
The pope of pop
Drives a church of steel
Deep pile acquaintances
Hollow after dinner
Accommodate inflation
Nervous fingers on the trigger

Love in the manscape
Guaranteed real
You feel what you pay
And you pay what you feel
Unfamiliar letters
Anagram situations
Silence please!
Poets at work

Free speech and more TV
Distribute liberally
I'd like mine to be
A true facsimile

 

End part beginning
17 and counting
Erase then cut and paste
From here to another place

Demonstrations, indignations
Colour, colour, collar, nation

Empty and filling
Ready and willing
A brase to cut and dash
It's another current fashion

Patterns of behaviour
I've been to Monrovia
Inflate to make a splash
Cut and diced it always lacks passion

 

Splinter of wood underneath a nail
Spiked on a tree where hope was pinned

Pining for a moment of even more
It just slipped out there

Harping on the old tune, playing the piping
Suspense on a bridgehead distorting and curving classical angles

Hanging in the slipstream
Is there any movement?
Swaying in the shadows
Could this be my moment?

Novel undertakings clear the place where it all feeds in
Promising tomorrows we shall see what we shall see

Forensic score the final test, borrowing blood the final brief
Quicken to the point express arrival, it's yours today

 

Sporting effects
In a small black reptile
Broadened at the shoulder
And swing at the hips

Room for a big fish
A crack of whips
Demander of service
And generous tips

Narrow in the eye
And puller of wool
The bow on the purse strings
Diaries full, arrangements fixed

A crossing of arms
The sucking of cheeks
The appetite rich
From scaling peaks

Badges of office
Extensive plates
Cultivating pets
Expensive dates

 

Who are the masked men?
Who are the cashed men?
Who are the flash men?

Where is the funman?
Where is the sunman?
Where is the gunman?

Where are the fast men?
Where are the past men?
Where are the last men?

On the table they're pawing the details
They wait for the meal to walk in the door
Edible hunter seeks credible victim
Sincerely rich seeks sceptical poor

In the corner they're shifting the ashes
Loyal traitor seeks empty womb
Oaken Tailor seeks viable impasse
Eternal youth seeks fatal bloom

 

No one from a glass has landed
The beam is down
Colours in regiments
Out of body experiences

The alien kidnappers
They place our graves
Ride the highways
Buying smiles

Bite off your tongue
Swallow it whole
Before it wags
Betrays us all

Purvey sour dreams
Will drink enterprise
Off-white off-set
Children of groceries
