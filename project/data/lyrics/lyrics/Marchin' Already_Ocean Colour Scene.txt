[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
Sonny signed his name up for tomorrow
And laughed with all his friends
At all the little men who borrow tunes
They heard just yesterday
Davey got us down but we got away
And drank to all the days
That we had whiled away
Just playing Robin Hood a little out of phase

[Chorus]
And then the nightmares come
And you get blown away
And up in your room your walls are cold
You find your head is holding out
For the welcome of a better day
And then the nightmares come
And you get blown away
And up in your room your walls are getting colder
Like you're getting on a roller coaster
You can't find the brakes

[Verse 2]
Stevie burned the sky when he flew away
And left us things to say
When all the world was falling down
Around our shoulders, cold and grey
Harry carried on in his usual way
And Minnie went inside
He came out once and we both cried
And Minnie blew my head away

[Chorus]
And then the nightmares come
And you get blown away
And up in your room your walls are cold
You find your head is holding out
For the welcome of a better day
And then the nightmares come
And you get blown away
And up in your room your walls are getting colder
Like you're getting on a roller coaster
You can't find the brakes

[Verse 3]
When you're giving everything away
Everybody lets you pay
You're saving up for a better day
Seeing things in a better way
When you know you've got to live
There's nothing you won't give
To hear the phone and not let it ring
Every Monday morning
Shughie found love and he almost cried
We laughed and wondered why
We loved the sky and found the space
And gazed out over Stevie's place

[Chorus]
And then the nightmares come
When your friends go away
And up in your room your walls are cold
You find your head is holding out
For the welcome of a better day
And then the nightmares come
And you get blown away
And up in your room your walls are getting colder
Like you're getting on a roller coaster
You can't find the brakes
