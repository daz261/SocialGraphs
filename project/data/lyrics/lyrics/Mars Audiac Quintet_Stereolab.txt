[Verse 1]
I didn't question, I didn't know
As far as I'd seen, life was endless
When I realised I had to let go
We are mere mortals as to the rest

[Chorus 1]
It's not eternal, imperishable
While on the move
It's not eternal, interminable
Progress is the clue

[Verse 2]
I thought IBM was born with the world
The US flag would float forever
The cold opponent did pack away
The capital will have to follow

[Chorus 2]
It's not eternal, imperishable
Oh, yes, it will go
It's not eternal, interminable
The dinosaur law

[Chorus 2]
It's not eternal, imperishable
Oh, yes, it will go
It's not eternal, interminable
The dinosaur law

[Bridge]
Look at the symbols, they are alive
They move, evolve, and then they die

 

They are one of the same
Two inevitables, two inevitables
We can't avoid dying
Bursting through our barriers
They are one of the same
They are one of the same
Two inevitables, two inevitables
We can't avoid dying
Bursting through our barriers
They are one of the same
They are one of the same
Two inevitables, two inevitables
We can't avoid dying
Bursting through our barriers
They are one of the same
They are one of the same
Two inevitables, two inevitables
We can't avoid dying
Bursting through our barriers
They are one of the same
They are one of the same
Two inevitables, two inevitables
We can't avoid dying
Bursting through our barriers
They are one of the same
They are one of the same
Two inevitables, two inevitables
We can't avoid dying
Bursting through our barriers
They are one of the same
They are one of the same
Two inevitables

Two inevitables, two inevitables
We can't avoid dying
Bursting through our barriers
They are one of the same
They are one of the same
Two inevitables, two inevitables
We can't avoid dying
Bursting through our barriers
They are one of the same
They are one of the same
Two inevitables, two inevitables
We can't avoid dying
