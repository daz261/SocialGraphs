Oh yeah

Massive grooves from the electric church of
Psychofunkadelic grungelism
Rock music, low down
Let the funky music take you higher

Wrangle jangle
Something to believe in
Wrangle jangle
Something to believe in

If you're listening to the madness
Maybe I can help you lose your mind
So give in stay for a while
Hear the sound of pounding in your ear hole

Wrangle jangle
Something to believe in
Wrangle jangle
Something to believe in

Wrangle jangle
Something to believe in
Wrangle jangle
Something to believe in
Wrangle jangle
Something to believe in
Wrangle jangle
Something to believe in

 

Oh shakey

It all blows my mind
Sea to sea, glory glory
All stars 'n' stripes forever

Micro-vibe time
To give me something to ease this pressure
Let's all stand in line tonight

Everybody, shakey thing
Everybody, shake your thing
Everybody, shakey thing
Everybody, shake your thing

Tell me what's on your mind
Don't be afraid to free your face
Ever get out of time
You can find your space in the balance
Honors not a crime
All depends on where you come from
Oh I'm out of line, don't listen to me

Everybody, shakey thing
Everybody, shake your thing
Everybody, shakey thing
Everybody, shake your thing
Shakey thing

Everybody, shakey thing
Everybody, shake your thing
Everybody, shakey thing
Everybody, shake your thing

Everybody, shakey thing
Everybody, shakey thing
Everybody, shakey, shakey, shakey thing
Everybody, shakey thing
