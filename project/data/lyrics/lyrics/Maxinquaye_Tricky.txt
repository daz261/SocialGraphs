The place where [6x]

Where I stand

[Hook 2x:]
The place where I stand gives way to liquid lino
Underneath the weeping willow lies a weeping whino

The mind's a crowd, search for the spaces
Turn around, time's gone, I take ten paces
Been up ahead, can't make head or tail of it
I drink till I'm drunk and I smoke till I'm senseless

See in black and white, feel in slow motion
I drown myself in sorrow until I wake up tomorrow
The illusion of confusion; it's not from where I am sat
(Recircle, recycle, resemble me)
Different levels of the devil's company

They lead us outside, take us out quietly
To the cage through the bars
You see scars, results of my rage

[Hook 2x]

The mind's a crowd (the illusion of confusion)
Search for the spaces (search for the)
Turn around time's gone (turn around, gone)
I take ten paces (I take ten paces)
Been up ahead
Can't make head or tail of it (can't make head or tail of it)
I drink 'til I'm drunk (I smoke)
And I smoke 'til I'm senseless (I smoke, I smoke)

See in black and white
Feel in slow motion (feel in slow motion, and drown, drown myself in sorrow)
Drown myself in sorrow (till I wake up tomorrow)
Until I wake up tomorrow (the illusion of)
I drown myself in sorrow (the illusion of)
Until I wake up tomorrow (the illusion of, the illusion of)
I drown myself in (the illusion of))
I drown myself in (until I, until I wake up tomorrow)
The illusion of confusion
Is not from where I am sat (is not from where I'm circle)

 

I got a letter from the government the other day
Opened and read it, it said they were suckers
They wanted me for their army or whatever
Picture me giving a damn, I said never

Here is a land that never gave a damn
About a brother like myself because they never did
I wasn't with it, but just that very minute
It occured to me the suckers had authority

Cold sweatin' as I dwell in my cell, how long has it been?
They got me sittin' in the state pen
I gotta get out but that thought was thought before
I contemplated a plan on the cell floor

I'm not a fugitive on the run
But a brother like me began to be another one
Public enemy servin' time, they drew the line y'all
They criticize me for some crime

I got a letter
I got a letter
I got a letter
Picture me giving a damn, I said never

It occured to me the suckers had authority

I'm not a fugitive on the run

Many switch in
Switch on, switch off
Many switch in
Switch on, switch off
Many switch in
Switch on, switch off
Many switch in
Switch on, switch off
Many switch in
Switch on, switch off

Nevertheless they cannot understand that I'm a black man
And I could never be a veteran
On the strength, the situation's unreal
I got a raw deal, so I'm lookin' for the steel
Lookin' for the steel

I got a letter from the government the other day
Opened and read it, it said they were suckers
They wanted me for their army or whatever
