Killing hurts
It has to be done
Peace and love
Who's number one?

The right to give
Learn to bleed, it's free
Pain is outside
Lift it up to see

Step ahead
Always wear the past
Dying, soothe me
Beneath the smell of grass

No world secret
Kept is too intent
I've got my nerve
Self-help, self-help confidence

Confidence
