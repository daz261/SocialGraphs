[Verse 1]
Falling into space
At the end of time
Black as the black in your eye
Staring through a hole in the ozone
There's nobody home
To play back your ansaphone
Climax out of blue
Is it just another high?
No there must be something new
Now that I'm so alien

[Chorus]
Entering the atmosphere
Don't know what is waiting here (oh no)
If there's nothing left to fear
When they come together in
The Big Bang Generation

[Verse 2]
Teardrop in the sky
Bursting my eye
Sound of morning sighs
This life is stranger than fiction
Surreal addiction
It's all I recognize
Feeding off the habit
Losing control
Where is it leading to?
Now that I'm the alien

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
(Feel like I'm losing control)
Big Bang Generation
(Now that I'm here alone)
Big Bang Generation
(Feel like I'm losing control)
Big Bang Generation
(Feel like I'm losing it)
We're going to come together here

[Outro]
Where you coming from?
When we going to burn out? Don't know
Having so much fun
Greetings from the Big Bang Generation
Big Bang Generation
Meet you in the Big Bang Generation
Together in the Big Bang Generation
Together we're the Big Bang Generation
