Collected thoughts
Never forget
The final hour
Now is set
Paranoia
In your cold soul
Man's requiem
In silence told

Sacrificed - The fallen lie
All areas - Now pacified
As they are - We shall become
The glory of... another battle won

The long dark path - Journey on
May lose the war - This day is done
Await tomorrow - Foretold destiny
Withdraw the veil - Friend or enemy

Constructed
Too much haste
All is now
Laid to waste

Unchained
Sanity's unsafe
All is now
Laid to waste

Constructed
Too much haste
All is now
Laid to waste

Senses recaptured - Tortured knowledge
Laid to waste

 

Remembrance
Sanity's surreal
Boundaries blurred
The turning wheel
Perspectives
Of equal might
Engage in battle
None is right

Centuries... of hatred
Return... from chaos

Feel the force
Destroy the will
Mankind tastes
This bitter pill
Now converging
Freedom cried
Unconnected
Millions died

Lifetime... of darkness
Return... from chaos

Not fallen prey
Nothing will overcome
With the banner held high
Let the chaos overrun
