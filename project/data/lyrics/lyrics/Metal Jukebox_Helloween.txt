In the shuffling madness
Of the locomotive breath
Runs the all time loser
Headlong to his death
And he feels the piston scraping
Steam breaking on his brow
Old Charlie stole the handle
And the train, it won't stop going
No way to slow it down, oh

He sees his children jumping off
At stations one by one
His woman and his best friend
In bed and having fun
And oh, he's crawling down the corridor
On his hands and knees
Old Charlie stole the handle
And the train, it won't stop going
No way to slow down, oh
No way to slow down

He hears the silence howling
When he catches angels as they fall
And the all time winner
Has got him by the balls
Oh, and he picks up Gideon's Bible
And it's open at page one
I think God, he stole the handle
And the train, it won't stop going

No way to slow down
No way to slow down
No way to slow down
No way to slow down

 

I wasn't jealous before we met
Now every man I see is a potential threat
And I'm possessive it isn't nice
You've heard me saying that smoking was my only vice
But now it isn't true
Now everything is new
And all I've learned
Has overturned
I beg of you

Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me

It was like shooting a sitting duck
A little small talk a smile and baby I was stuck
I still don't know what you've done with me
A grown up man should never fall so easily
I feel a kind of fear
When I don't have you near
Unsatisfied
I skip my pride
I beg you dear

Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go sharing your devotion
Lay all your love on me

I've had a few little love affairs
They didn't last very long and they've been pretty scarce
I used to think that was sensible
It makes the truth even more incomprehensible
Cause everything is new
And everything is you
And all I've learned
Has overturned
What can I do

Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go sharing your devotion
Lay all your love on me

Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go sharing your devotion
Lay all your love on me

Don't go wasting your emotion
