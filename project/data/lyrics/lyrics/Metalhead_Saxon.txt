[Byford/Quinn/Scarrattt/Carter]

Two thousand years they stand behind us
Are we just travellers in time
We face the phantoms of our future
They face destruction of their kind

These, these are the days
These, these are the times
Are we just travellers in time

The ancient stones of time they call us
To hear their mystic prophecies
They've stood in silence they're immortal
Forgotton page of history

These, these are the days
These, these are the times
Are we just travellers in time
Are we just travellers in time

The crystal powers they will take you
Far across the sands of time
Searching ever for an answer
What's the future of mankind

These, these are the days
These, these are the times
Are we just travellers in time
Are we just travellers in time
Are we just travellers in time
Are we just travellers in time
In time, time, time, time, time
