In my desperation, I'll take anything from you
'Cause what I am is what I need and there is nothing I can do
I'm a slave to your frustration and I'm working for this pain
But in the end I'm nothing and it doesn't mean a goddamn thing

I don't want to live like this
I don't want to be like you
I don't need what I don't miss
This is what I've got to do

Well, I don't want to be here, but I just don't have a choice
And I'd like to say a prayer, but I cannot find my voice
Well, I feel I've lived a lifetime and I guess it's just as well
'Cause the life that I've been given is like living in an empty shell

Well, I'm just in denial of the things I cannot do
But everything that I can't have is all because of you
I don't need a guilty conscience, I don't need to be a star
All I need is some redemption, but that just won't get me very far

 

Whatever happened to the life I had in your eyes?
I guess I died and I started to believe your lies
Like the voice that I heard in the night
If you think I'm crazy then you're goddamned right
I need to get out of this mess you put me in
And think that home is where I'd like to begin
Well, I really doubt that you think that I would be fine
Well, c'mon baby, now it's temptation time

[Chorus:]
You fucked up, it's easy to see
But I don't know what that has to do with me
'Cause I'm knocked down and ready to fight
If you think I'm crazy, then you're goddamn right

You didn't happen to save my soul
As it went out the door with the rest of my goals
Well, I just decided that I might like it back
And I'm as serious as a goddamn heart attack
Well, now baby, I tried to make it plain
When I said I was getting tired of these stupid little games
Well, it's very simple, if you try to keep in mind
Well now baby, it's temptation time

[Chorus:]
You fucked up, it's easy to see
But I don't know what that has to do with me
'Cause I'm knocked down and ready to fight
If you think I'm crazy, then you're goddamn right

[Chorus:]
You fucked up, it's easy to see
But I don't know what that has to do with me
'Cause I'm knocked down and ready to fight
If you think I'm crazy, then you're goddamn right

I didn't mean to cause you any grief
But the things that you do to me go way beyond belief
Well, I never thought that I'd feel like I was dead
But your voice is like a bullet in my goddamn head
And I need to feel wanted, I guess anybody would
But you treat me like a child and that just ain't any good
Well, I just want to have the things that I think are mine
C'mon baby, it's temptation time

[Chorus:]
You fucked up, it's easy to see
But I don't know what that has to do with me
'Cause I'm knocked down and ready to fight
If you think I'm crazy, then you're goddamn right
You fucked up, it's easy to see
But I don't know what that has to do with me
'Cause I'm knocked down and ready to fight
If you think I'm crazy, then you're goddamn right
