Feeling the fire under my feet
I was a liar, you were a cheat
Playing with knives we were cut close to home
Close to the bone
Just so alone

Something to have, something to hold
Something to share so I've been told
Deep in your eyes you're one hundred years old
Cause the years have not been kind to you, you know

Heal it up
Heal it up
Heal me up
Heal me up
Heal me up

Feeling the pinch, feeling the hope
Feeling the void deep in my soul
Feeling my feelings so out of control
Cause the years have not been kind to me, I know

Heal it up
Heal it up
Heal it up
Heal it up
