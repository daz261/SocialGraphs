Isn't it weird
Isn't it strange
Even though we're just two strangers
On this runaway train
We're both trying to find
A place in the sun
We've lived in the shadows
Doesn't everyone
Isn't it strange
How we all feel a little bit weird
Sometimes

Isn't it hard
Standing in the rain
Yeah, you're on the verge of going crazy
And your heart's in pain
No one can hear
But you're screaming so loud
You feel like you're all alone
In a faceless crowd
Isn't it strange
How we all get a little bit weird
Sometimes

Sitting on the side waiting for a sign
Hoping that my luck will change
Reaching for a hand that can understand
Someone who feels the same
When you live in a cookie cutter world
Being different is a sin
So you don't stand out
And you don't fit in
Weird

Sitting on the side waiting for a sign
Hoping that my luck will change
Reaching for a hand that can understand
Someone who feels the same
When you live in a cookie cutter world
If you're different you can't win
So you don't stand out
And you don't fit in

Isn't it strange
How we all feel a little bit weird
Strange
How we all get a little bit
Strange
How we all get a little bit weird
Sometimes
Just a little bit weird sometimes
