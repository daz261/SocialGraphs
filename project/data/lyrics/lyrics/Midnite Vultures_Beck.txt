[Verse 1]
I'm mixing business with leather
Christmas with Heather
Freaks flock together
And make all the b-boys scream

[Chorus]
All right (All right)
Turn it up now (Turn it up now)
All right (All right)
Turn it up now

[Verse 2]
Word up to the manthing
She's always cold lamping
Visine at the canteen
I just wanna watch you dance

[Chorus]
All right (All right)
Turn it up now (Turn it up now)
All right (All right)
Turn it up now

[Post-Chorus]
Do you want to  ride on the Baltic sea?
I'll be your mistress C.O.D
I'll comb your hair, re-write your diary
Pour champagne on a honeybee

[Refrain]
(She can really do me)
(She can really do me)
(She can look right through me)
(And make all the b-boys scream)

[Chorus]
All right
(Do you want a [Incomprehensible]?)
All right
(There's a meeting in the ladies room)
All right
(All the peoples that make it)
All right
(And the hot tub's looking real [Incomprehensible])

[Verse 3]
I'm mixing fitness with leather
Homework with Heather
Freaks flock together
And make all the lesbians scream

[Chorus]
All right (All right)
Turn it up now (Turn it up now)
All right (All right)
Turn it up now

[Post-Chorus]
Do you want to ride on the Baltic Sea?
I'll be your mistress C.O.D
I'll comb your hair, re-write your diary
Pour champagne on a honeybee

[Refrain]
(She can really do me)
(She can really do me)
(She can look right through me)
(And make all the b-boys scream)

[Outro]
(All right)
(All right)
(All right)
(All right)
