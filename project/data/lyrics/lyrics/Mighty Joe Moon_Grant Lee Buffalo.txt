Devastation at last, finally we meet
After all of these years out here in the street
I had a feeling you would make yourself known
You came along just to claim your place on the throne
Now I have been overthrown, overthrown

And I thought if I toed the right lines
But these mockingbirds won't let me shine

Devastation, my door was left open wide
You brought me into your heart and you swallowed my pride
I had a feeling you were hiding your thoughts
I made a note to myself, I nearly forgot
Now I'm overwrought, I'm overwrought

And I thought if I toed the right lines
But these mockingbirds won't let me shine
And I thought if I toed the right lines
But these mockingbirds won't let me shine

One day this ground will break and open up for me
I hope it will, I hope it will

Salutations at last, I'm down on my knees
I heard the bugle this morning blast Reveille
Woke from a dream where I was in a terrible realm
All my sails were ablaze, I was chained to the helm
Now I'm overwhelmed, overwhelmed

And I thought if I toed the right lines
But these mockingbirds won't let me shine
And I thought if I toed the right lines
But these mockingbirds won't let me shine
And I thought if I toed the right lines
But these mockingbirds won't let me shine
And I thought if I toed the right lines
But these mockingbirds won't let me shine
