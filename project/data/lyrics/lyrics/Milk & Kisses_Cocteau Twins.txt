[Verse]
It’s hard to judge, I get used to it
A living, sole survivor
Thought I’d be more sensitive
A living, sole survivor

[Chorus]
Had to find a job
Had to find a job
Those could be my clothes
What you have always been
You were an outlaw suddenly
Once I find a job
Once I find a job

[Verse]
Thought I’d found a seat to preach
Moving, less surviving
Product in a media court
Moving, less surviving

[Chorus]
Had to find a job
Once I find a job
I should arrive there
Where you have always been
You were an outlaw suddenly
Once I find a job
Once I find a job

Had to find a job
Once I find a job
Those could be my clothes
What you have always been
You were an outlaw suddenly
Once you find a job
You never earn enough

[Bridge]
And you’re speaking your heart
You saw the laddie

Call a memory
Don’t accept them for beauty
You didn’t matter
He’s just a laddie

Call a memory
Don’t accept them for beauty
You shook so hard
You saw the laddie

Call a memory
Don’t accept them for beauty
You, who to call
You saw the laddie

[Verse]
Part of him was living proof
A living, sole survivor
Thought I’d be more sensitive
A living, sole survivor

[Outro]
Such a great fuss
Living for
Living for
A something
A job

 

[Verses]
I’m at a loss
Don’t know what to do
Feel like I want him less now
Could he just hold me?
Don’t feel safe enough to
Surrender into sensation

Afraid but look what happens when
I don’t risk losing you
There’s no guarantees
I need to know
If the response is cold
I’m in the wrong place

[Chorus]
Is it like a dream?
Or does it seem grounded and real?
Is it like a dream?
Or does it seem grounded and real?

[Verses]
I feel a connection
A deep connection
But it’s not reflected
In time spent together
It’s reflected psychically
Emotionally

[Chorus]
Is it like a dream?
Or does it seem grounded and real?
Is it like a dream?
Or does it seem grounded and real?

[Outro]
This mountain of pleasure
I want to get lost in it
Sleep like a baby
Still close
Still close
Until I don’t know where you end
Or I begin
Until I just carry it in me
I wanna get lost
Wanna get lost
Wanna get lost
Lost in it
We’re still close
Still close
