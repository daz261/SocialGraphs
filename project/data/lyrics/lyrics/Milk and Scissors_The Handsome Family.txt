Here's a fish in my stomach a thousand years old
Can't swim a full circle
The water's too cold
Burnt out cars in my fingers
Conveyor belts flow, right angles and steam whistles
Nothing can grow
A big-antlered deer stepping into the road
A beautiful woman with her head in the stove
The skyscrapers crumble heavy with rats
The wind's full of beer cans and whiffle ball bats
This fish in my stomach wears a full length mink
But his teeth float in sherry in a jar by the sink
He's the withered remains of Rin Tin Tin taking his new Cadillac out for a spin
The endless sea of traffic lights never make a sound like
Ben Franklin's electric kite crashing to the
Ground and the Winnebago skeletons beneath this bankrupt town

 

There once was a poodle who thought he was a cowboy
But he lived in a cage the size of his thumb
And, though his white horse was a box of toothpicks
He galloped around until hit by a car
And sometimes I flap my arms like a hummingbird
Just to remind myself I'll never fly
And sometimes I burn my arms with cigarettes
Just to pretend I won't scream when I die

And if my life was as long as the moon's
I'd still be jealous of the sun
And if my life lasted only one day
I'd still be drunk by noon

And sometimes I can't wait to come down with cancer
At least then I'll get to watch tv all day
And on my deathbed I'll get all the answers
Even if all my questions are taken away

If my life was as long as the moon's
I'd still be jealous of the sun
If my life lasted only one day
I'd still be drunk by noon
