[Intro: All]
Show me the meaning of being lonely

[Verse 1: Brian & AJ]
So many words for the broken heart
It is hard to see in a crimson love
So hard to breathe
Walk with me and maybe
Nights of light so soon become
Wild and free I could feel the sun
Your every wish will be done
They tell me

[Chorus: All]
Show me the meaning of being lonely
Is this the feeling I need to walk with
Tell me why I can't be there where you are?
There is something missing in my heart

[Verse 2: Kevin & Nick]
Life goes on as it never ends
Eyes of stone observe the trends
They never say forever gaze, if only
Guilty roads to an endless love (endless love)
There is no control, are you with me now?
Your every wish will be done
They tell me

[Chorus: All, AJ & Brian]
Show me the meaning of being lonely
Is this the feeling I need to walk with (tell me why)
Tell me why I can't be there where you are?
There is something missing in my heart (heart!)

[Bridge: Howie, All, AJ]
There is nowhere to run
I have no place to go
Surrender my heart, body, and soul
How can it be you are asking me
To feel the things you never show?
(Show-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh!)

[Interlude: Brian]
You are missing in my heart
Tell me why can't I be there where you are?

[Chorus: All, (AJ), Brian & Nick]
Show me the meaning of being lonely (being lonely)
Is this the feeling I need to walk with (tell me why)
Tell me why I can't be there where you are? (where you are)
There is something missing in my heart
(You are missing from my heart)
Show me the meaning of being lonely (being lonely)
Is this the feeling I need to walk with
Tell me why I cannot be there where you are? (where you are)
There is something missing in my heart
