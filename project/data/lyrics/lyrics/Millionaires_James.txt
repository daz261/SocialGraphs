[Verse 1]
Doctor what is happening to me?
Palpitations my mind's diseased
Even my vision is impaired I'm losing my hair

[Chorus]
'Cause when I hold her in my arms
I feel like Fred Astaire

[Verse 2]
Lovesick my temperature's high
Just met a girl who believes we can fly
I'm a bull not a bear I'm a millionaire

[Chorus]
'Cause when I hold her in my arms
I feel like Fred Astaire

[Verse 3]
I believe in happiness I believe in love
I believe she fell to earth from somewhere high above
I believe in Hollywood don't believe that love must bring despair

[Chorus]
Cos when I hold her in my arms
I'm just like Fred Astaire

[Bridge]
He said love is just a disease a plague for the naive
These days no one believes these days no one believes

[Verse 4]
Meteors may strike the earth nations live and die
I'm the boy who got the girl now we're gonna fly
We can cross the race divide bridge a gap that wasn't really there

[Chorus 2]
Cos when I hold her in my arms
I feel like Fred Astaire

I'm gonna hold her in my arms
Just like Fred Astaire

[Outro]
I'm gonna hold her in this charm
Like Fred Astaire
Like Fred Astaire
Like Fred Astaire
