Brother to Brother (Gerardo Mejia/Alfred Rubalcava)

Tired from working overtime you clear your mind
Trying to figure out how much more
You must climb to find a way to reach happiness
Cannot settle for less you're stressed
You think back in your youth trying to soothe the pain
Cuz down memory lane it don't rain
But a hurricane swept away your dreams and plans
Your last chance to glance, you're a victim of circumstance
There's no one to blame but yourself
You spend your nights in a lousy motel
Where the personnel never cares to card
To see how old you really are
What's done is done you must be strong
So just hang on you gotta move on and live on
You're young and bright close your eyes turn off the light
Don't forget to give my niece a kiss goodnight

BRIDGE:
Asi es la vida
Brother to Brother
Aunque nadie me lo crea
Brother to Brother

Baby's crying mom's asleep, she's overworked
Her part-time job as a clerk will have to do
Till that tax refund comes through
You claimed eight instead of two
But your wife can't take it and she's tired of faking it
She packs her bags and leaves you, just ain't making it
You're not the husband that she thought you would become
But leaving her kid don't make her much of a mom
Well, now that your wife walked out of your world
How do you plan on raising your girl
Being a dad you've brought home the bread
But you've never made a bed
So you're hanging by the phone near the door
Looking out the window as the wind blows
But she's never coming back
She's much too smart for that

CHORUS:
Well little brother you weren't prepared
For what life had in store
But there's much to live for
Cuz life is full of surprises
And when it brings you down you just gotta keep rising
So I'm still beside you bro 24/7
To still remind you why a brother is worth having
Hermano, you've been there for me
And there's nothing I wouldn't do for my family
