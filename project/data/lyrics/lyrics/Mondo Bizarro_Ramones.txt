[Verse 1]
Out of the bed at 6:15, in a rush and you can't think
Got to catch the bus and train, I'm in a rush and feeling insane

[Chorus]
I can't take this crazy pace, I've become a mental case
Yeah, this is the job that ate my brain

[Verse 2]
Go to work, it's such a drag, face the boss, he's such a nag
In a suit and in a tie, I look so lame I want to die

[Chorus]
I can't take this crazy pace, I've become a mental case
Yeah, this is the job that ate my brain
I can't take this crazy pace, I've become a mental case
Yeah, this is the job that ate my brain

[Verse 3]
I punch the clock at 9:05, I know I'm late, but still alive
Everyone just stares at me, I'm last in line for prosperity

[Chorus]
I can't take this crazy pace, I've become a mental case
Yeah, this is the job that ate my brain

[Verse 4]
Five o'clock rolls around I feel so glad I kiss the ground
There isn't enough hours in the day, there's go to be a better way

[Chorus]
I can't take this crazy pace, I've become a mental case
Yeah, this is the job that ate my brain
I can't take this crazy pace, I've become a mental case
Yeah, this is the job that ate my brain

 

[Verse 1]
Well no one ever thought this one would survive
Helpless child, going to walk a drum beat behind
I lock you in a dream, I never let you go
I never let you laugh or smile, not you

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, I just want to walk right out of this world
''Cause everybody has a poison heart
I just want to walk right out of this world
'Cause everybody has a poison heart

[Verse 2]
Making friends with a homeless torn up man
He just kind of smiles, it really shakes me up
There's danger on every corner but I'm okay
Walking down the street, trying to forget yesterday

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, I just want to walk right out of this world
'Cause everybody has a poison heart
I just want to walk right out of this world
'Cause everybody has a poison heart

[Chorus]
A poison heart
A poison heart
A poison heart, yeah

[Verse 3]
You know that life really takes its toll
And a poet's gut reaction is to search his very soul
So much their confusion before my eyes
But nothing seems to phase me, and this one still survives

[Pre-Chorus]
I just want to walk right out of this world
'Cause everybody has a poison heart
I just want to walk right out of this world
'Cause everybody has a poison heart
Well I just want to walk right out of this world
'Cause everybody has a poison heart

[Chorus]
A poison heart
A poison heart
A poison heart
A poison heart
A poison heart
A poison heart
A poison heart
