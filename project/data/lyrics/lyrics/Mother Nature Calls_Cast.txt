Look out, look out, look out, look out
Look in, look in, look in
Look out, look out, look out, look out
Look in, look in, look in
All I do is a constant reminder
The future's here and it walks right behind you
All I see is a constant illusion
My head spins and my world's in confusion
Look out, look out, look out, look out
Look in, look in, look in
Look out, look out, look out, look out
Look in, look in, look in
All I see is self-rearranging
The moment's here but it's already changing
Take one step and that's your direction
You ain't sure, now, was that the intention?

Pre - Chorus:
Close my eyes, I think of times
And this memory's twisting my head
I've got a feelin' that it's all not over yet
I've got some things that I just cannot forget

Chorus:
All I do is think of you, you've got me on the run
On the run, on the run
On the run, on the run
Look out, look out, look out, look out
Look in, look in, look in
Look out, look out, look out, look out
Look in, look in, look in
Looking round, you can take it or leave it
You got a feeling but you must believe it
All you do is constantly changing
You feel a rise and it's already fading

Pre - Chorus + Chorus:
(Guitar Solo)
It's taken so long for the sun to appear
(look in, look in, look in, look out)
Now the blue sky above is so clear
(look out, look out, look out, look in)
And everything you need is so near
(look in, look in, look in, look in, look in, look out)
It's taken so long for the sun to appear
(look in, look in, look in, look out)
Now the blue sky above is so clear
(look out, look out, look out, look in)
Oh, and everything you need is so near
(look in, look in, look in, look out, look in)

 

Somebody's after me, I can't pretend to be
Something I know I'm not
And when they come for me
I'll just let them be
'Cause all that I need today, is all I need

I just wanna be thinking thoughts that I think
Dreaming my dreams and drifting within
I don't know where I'm goin'
But I know where I've been
Come on look within

Someone will always be more than I'll ever be
So then I'll be myself
And when they come for me
I'll just let them be
'Cause all that I need today, I need today

I just wanna be thinking thoughts that I think
Dreaming my dreams and drifting within
I don't know where I'm goin'
But I know where I've been
Come on, live your dream

Oh you're big enough
You're tuff enough
And now I begin to see
Girl you've gotta
Lay your love on me
It's big enough
So far enough
And as far as my eye can see
Girl you gotta
Lay your love on me
Lay your love on
Lay your love on
Lay your love on me

Somebody's after me, I can't pretend to be
Something I know I'm not
And when they come for me - I'll just let them be
'Cause all that I need today, I need today

An' I just wanna be thinking thoughts that I think
Dreaming my dreams and drifting within
I don't know where I'm goin'
But I know where I've been
So come on, live your dream

Like a bird without wings
Like a bird who don't sing
Like a fish on dry land
Like I'm swimming in sand
Like a bird without wings
Like a bird who don't sing
Like a fish on dry land
Like I'm swimming in sand
Like I've fallen for you
