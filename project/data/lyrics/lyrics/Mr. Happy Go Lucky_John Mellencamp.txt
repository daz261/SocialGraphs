Jerry's yelling at the man in the Moon
He's right outside of my window
He acts like a madman from time to time
I hope he brings it to a crescendo soon
Jerry's yelling at the man in the moon
Jerry's yelling at the man in the moon

Jerry rides his skateboard down the street
He's thirty-seven years old with six children
He sees the world through a ten year old boy's eyes
He doesn't even notice that it's raining outside
Jerry's yelling at the man in the moon
Jerry's yelling at the man in the moon

But sometimes he cries
He wants me to console him
But I know that he's lying about everything he's told me

Jerry's yelling at the man in the moon
Says he's prepared to suffer the consequences
What is his penalty for his immaturity
Will he be cast into eternal darkness
Jerry's yelling at the man in the moon
Jerry's yelling at the man in the moon
Jerry's yelling at the man in the moon
Jerry's yelling at the man in the moon
Jerry's yelling at the man in the moon
