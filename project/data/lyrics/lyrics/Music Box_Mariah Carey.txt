[Verse 1]
There's a hero
If you look inside your heart
You don't have to be afraid
Of what you are
Thereâ€™s an answer
If you reach into your soul
And the sorrow that you know
Will melt away

[Chorus]
And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And you'll finally see the truth
That a hero lies in you

[Verse 2]
It's a long road
When you face the world alone
No one reaches out a hand for you to hold
You can find love
If you search within yourself
And the emptiness you felt
Will disappear

[Chorus]
And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And you'll finally see the truth
That a hero lies in you

[Bridge]
Lord knows
Dreams are hard to follow
But don't let anyone
Tear them away
Hold on
There will be tomorrow
In time
You'll find the way

[Chorus]
And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And you'll finally see the truth
That a hero lies in you

[Outro]
That a hero lies in you
That a hero lies in you

 

[Verse 1]
If you're lonely
And need a friend
And troubles seem like
They never end
Just remember
To keep the faith
And love will be there
To light the way, yeah

[Chorus]
Anytime you need a friend
I will be here
Never be alone again
So don't you fear
Even if you're miles away
I'm by your side
So don't you ever be lonely
Love will make it alright

[Verse 2]
When the shadows are closing in
And your spirit diminishing
Just remember
You're not alone
And love will be there
To guide you home, oh

[Chorus]
Anytime you need a friend
I will be here
Never be alone again (No, oh)
So don't you fear (No, no, no, no)
Even if you're miles away (Even if you're miles away)
I'm by your side
Don't you ever be lonely
Love will make it alright

[Bridge]
If you just believe in me
I will love you endlessly, oh
Take my hand
Take me into your heart
I'll be there forever, baby
I won't let go
I'll never let go

[Chorus]
Anytime you need a friend
I will be here
Never be alone again (No, no)
So don't you fear (Don't worry, don't fear, yeah)
Even if you're miles away
I'm by your side (I'm with you wherever you are)
So don't you ever be lonely
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright
Anytime you need a friend
I will be here (Yeah, you know it's alright)
Never be alone again (Oh, woah)
So don't you fear (Don't never fear)
Even if you're miles away (Oh)
I'm by your side (I'm by your side)
Don't you ever be lonely
It's alright, it's alright (Yeah)
Anytime you need a friend (Anytime)
I will be here (Oh)
You'll never be alone again (You'll never be alone)
So don't you fear (You never will)
Even if you're miles away (Oh)
I'm by your side (I'm by your side)
Don't you ever be lonely
It's alright, it's alright (Yeah, yeah)
Anytime you need a friend
I will be here
