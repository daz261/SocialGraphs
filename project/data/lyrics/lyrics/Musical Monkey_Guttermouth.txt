Howdy folks its me again
Got a message to convey
I'm so confused what's to lose
I think i might turn gay
On the day my bitch left
She said stick it up your rear
She never thought she'd hear these words
Woo your mustache is so tickly down there
Drill my ass
Oh god it's so tight
Drill my ass
This is my first time
Drill my ass
I love you/love you too
I live with bill its such a thrill
We get it on so fine
We tend our garden everyday
Sometimes we get 69
Play dress up and have puppet shows
We skip and dance and sing
He's so helpful he shaves my back
Mark it's my turn to wear the cowboy hat
It's so hard
It feels so right
It's so hard
The way he holds me
It's so hard
I could just die
When we go drinking
It's so hard
The we start thinking
But doin it to liberace
Then we bake a quiche
We went to church he held my hand
I gazed into his eyes
He kissed my ear i said oh dear
My shaft began to rise
He wispered let's get married
I squeeked and shouted yes
Suddenly our live a big mess
He wore a tux i wore a big pink dress
Drill my ass
Not sure i'm right
Drill my ass
What was i thinking
Drill my ass
I like bull fights
Drill my ass
No more knittng
Drill my ass
No more skipping
I tried it once a whole 6 months
So long mustache
