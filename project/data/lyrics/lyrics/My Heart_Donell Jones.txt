[Verse 1]
I see us in the park
Strolling the summer days of imaginings in my head
And words from my heart told only to the wind
Felt even without being said

[Chorus]
I don't wanna bore you with my troubles, yeah
But there's something about your love
That makes me weak and knocks me off my feet
There's something about your love
That makes me weak and knocks me off my feet
Knocks me off my feet
And I don't wanna bore you with it
Oh, but I love you, I love you, I love you
I don't wanna bore you with it
Oh, but I love you, I love you, I love you, more and more

[Verse 2]
We lay beneath the stars under a lover's tree
That seems through the eyes of my mind
I reach out for the part of me that lives in you
That only our two hearts can find

[Chorus]
I don't wanna bore you with my troubles, yeah
But there's something about your love
That makes me weak and knocks me off my feet
There's something about your love, yeah
Oh, that makes me weak and knocks me off my feet
Knocks me off my feet
And I don't wanna bore you with it
Oh, but I love you, I love you, I love you
I don't wanna bore you with it
Oh, but I love you, I love you, I love you

[Outro]
I don't wanna bore you with it
Oh, but I love you, I love you, I love you
I don't wanna bore you with it
Oh, but I love you, I love you, I love you
I don't wanna bore you with it
Oh, but I love you, I love you, I love you
I don't wanna bore you with it
Oh, but I love you, I love you, I love you

 

[Chorus](2x)
You know what I want
You know what I need
Come on and do me right, tonight

[Verse 1]
Lay your body down
Let me take control of you
Do the things that lovers do, tonight
You better be prepared to stay
'Cause you ain't leavin' till the next day
It's gonna be non-stop lovin' all night
I'll make you feel all right

[Pre-Chorus]
You know what I wanna do tonight, work your body inside
I don't want no interruptions
(Baby, there will no interruptions, oh yeah)
You know what I wanna do tonight, work your body inside
I don't want no interruptions
You know that I wanna make you feel real good
Baby, inside, baby, inside

[Chorus](2x)

[Verse 2]
Baby, don't be scared
Let me kiss your body everywhere
Pleasure is the thing I wanna give to you
Close your eyes and get ready
It's gonna be non-stop lovin' all night
I'll make you feel all right

[Pre-Chorus]
You know what I wanna do tonight, work your body inside
I don't want no interruptions
(Everything's gonna be alright just let me)
You know what I wanna do tonight, work your body inside
(C'mon, c'mon)
I don't want no interruptions
I wanna make you feel real good
Baby, inside, baby, inside

[Chorus](2x)

[Break]

[Chorus](2x)
