Artist: Simon Carly / Album: Miscellaneous / Song: My Romance

My romance doesn't have to have a moon in the sky
My romance doesn't need a blue lagoon standing by
No month of May, no twinkling stars
No hide away, no softly guitars

My romance doesn't need a castle rising in Spain
Nor a dance to a constantly surprising refrain
Wide awake, I can make my most fantastic dreams come true

My romance doesn't need a thing but you
My romance doesn't need one thing but you

 

What good is the scheming
The planning and dreaming
That comes with each new love affair

The love that you cherish
So often might perish
And leave you with castles in air

When you're alone
Who cares for starlit skies
When you're alone
The magic moonlight dies
At break of dawn
There is no sunrise
When your lover has gone

What lonely hours
The evening shadows bring
What lonely hours
With memories lingering

Like faded flowers
Life can't mean anything
When your lover has gone

When your lover's gone

When your lover has gone

 

You're my funny valentine
Sweet comic valentine
You make me smile with my heart
You're looks are laughable, unphotographable
Yet you're my favourite work of art
Is your figure less than Greek
Is your mouth a little weak

When you open it to speak are you smart
But don't change a hair for me
Not if you care for me
Stay little valentine, stay

Each day is Valentine's Day

 

He's a fool and don't I know it
But a fool can have his charms
I'm in love and don't I show it
Like a babe in arms
Love's the same old sad sensation
Lately I've not slept a week
Since this half pint imitation's
Put me on the blink

I'm wild again, beguiled again
A simpering whimpering child again
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered am I

I couldn't sleep and wouldn't sleep
Until love came and told me I shouldn't sleep

Bewitched, bothered and bewildered am I

Oh I lost my heart but what of it
He is home I am free
Oh but he can laugh and I love it
Although the laugh's on me

I'll sing to him, each spring to him
And worship the trousers that cling to him
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered am I

I'll sing to him, each spring to him
And long for the day I'll cling to him
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered am I
