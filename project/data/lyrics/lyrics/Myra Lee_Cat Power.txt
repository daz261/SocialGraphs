Here you go
Say it that she's ill
Here you go
Marriage and kids and
Drug
Addiction
All the lies aside
I believe I am the
Luckiest person alive
Hell we all die
Sometimes
Hell we all try
Somewhere
Money always sees
Money always draws
The light
Hope you can see
Through the beggers
In the clear
Do you happen to know
Where I am from?
I'm lost in this
Sore far from home
Far from home
Do you happen to know
Where I am from?
I'm lost
Far from mum
All the lies aside
I believe I am the
Luckiest person alive
Hell we all die
Sometimes
Hell we all try
Somewhere X4
Stand on my feet
So I can see yours
Standing on my hands
I found my way home
Standing on my head
