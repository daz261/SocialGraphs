Mind your step as you make your way
Through the church in to this world of sand
Picture an angle with a cigarette burnin
With a long slow drag
She welcomes you in where youâ€™ll be
Dancing in the low light
Sweat dripping down like a dew
Scratchin metal and a cry and moan
Riding in a bottle in the back of a room

Fire, fire from the inside
Rhythm, like a hurricane rain
Mercy, comes after midnight
While youâ€™re washing me down with the sound of your National Steel

Took its smile on a wild rose
Born in the heat of the south
Your kisses they went to my head like a whiskey
She was a bootlegged love with her stockings rolled down
People cried to cry as a wolf starts to howl, howled like a midnight train
Roll on, roll on, rolled like a river
A shot of burning silver pounding through my feet like fire

Fire, fire from the inside
Rhythm like a hurricane rain
Mercy, comes after midnight
While youâ€™re washing me down with the sound of your National Steel

Mind your step as you make your way
Through the church in to this world of sand
Picture an angle with a cigarette burnin
With a long slow drag
She welcomes you in where youâ€™ll be
Dancing in the low light
With the sweat dripping down like a dew
Scratchin metal with a cry and moan
And riding in a bottle at the back of the room

Fire, fire from the inside
Rhythm, like a hurricane rain
Mercy, comes after midnight
Wash me down, washin me down
Fire, from the inside
Rhythm, like a hurricane rain
Mercy, comes after midnight
Wash me down with the sound of your National Steel

National Steel
Hmmm alright
