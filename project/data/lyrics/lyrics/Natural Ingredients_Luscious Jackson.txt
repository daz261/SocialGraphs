I feel small when i am next to you
I feel big when i forget you
Why do you make me feel so small?

I'm draggin in your deep shag
What I become, What I become
I'm in your deep shag
Stuck in rags
What I become, what I become

Believe me I am teething when my eyes are full of feeling
I forget my personality
My hellraising days
They seem so sweet
And I'm always telling you
Lies to hide the truth inside
The poems I become
The minute I succumb to your embrace
