If I let go of the world that I was holding
A passenger that could not fly
In search of souls
In search of something
Let it go
Let it slide

Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Ooh oh yeah yeah yeah yeah

When i find out what went on
I'll bring it back
But it won't be easy
They won't believe how a man
He could drown
In a starseed, starseed

I hoped to find why the world wasn't glowing
It darkens as we end this ride
I've fallen back under the equator
I'm back inside I'm back inside

Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah,.....mmmm so real
Ooh oh yeah yeah yeah yeah

When i find out what went on
I'll bring it back
But it won't be easy
They won't believe how a man
He could drown
In a starseed, starseed

It's all or nothing, nothing

But i found out what went on
I'll bring it back but it won't be easy
They won't believe the man he could
But i'd choose starseed over nothing
Nothing

But i found out what went on
I'll bring it back but it won't be easy
They won't believe the man he could
But i'd choose starseed over nothing
Nothing

Starseed over
Starseed over
