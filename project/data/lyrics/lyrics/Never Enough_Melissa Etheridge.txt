The future? Ahaha

[Verse 1]
Well I've been looking
Looking for an answer
Somebody promised me one
And I've been waiting
Waiting for the chance
Well somebody said it would come
Wake me up when we hit 2001

[Verse 2]
And I've been talking
Talking to the maker
Of the compromise
They said she's fine
Call the undertaker
You shouldn't look surprised
Wake me up when we hit 2001
Wake me up when we hit 2001

[Bridge]
Oh, it's barely alive
With a story at five
So turn your video on
We live in these years
Dark age of fear
Meet me in 2001

[Verse 3]
I saw my sister
Saw the ones who twist her
A social suicide
If looks could kill
Each and every cheap thrill
Could be a homicide
Wake me up when we hit 2001
Wake me up when we hit 2001

[Bridge]
Oh, it's barely alive
With a story at five
So turn your video on
We live in these years
Dark age of fear
Meet me in 2-0-0-1

[Verse 4]
I've been searching
I've been searching for a reason
To either fight or fly
Either way
Patriot or treason
It's gonna be one long hard ride
Wake me up when we hit 2001
Oh wake me up when we hit 2001
No wake me up when we hit 2001
Oh wake me up when we hit 2001

[Outro]
The future?
The future?
The future?
The future?
The future?
The future?
The future?
The future?
