[Intro]
And I love you, baby
And I, and I love you, baby
And I love you, baby
And I, and I love you, baby
And I love you, baby
And I, and I love you
And I love you

[Prelude]
An angel has always been thought
To be one of God's most precious works
I guess that's how she had you fooled
Because she was an angel in disguise
Hurt and pain could never come from her
So you left me only to find that
Hurt and pain involves her
But now you see your mistakes
And now you see your angel was a fake
But my love was never misplaced
See, baby, my love is true
And most importantly, still, I love you
(Still, I love you)

[Chorus]
An angel in disguise she was
But somehow you fell for her
And though she broke your heart that day
And left you in the rain
But still, I love you
An angel in disguise she was
But somehow you fell for her
And though she broke your heart that day
And left you in the rain
But still, I love you

[Verse 1]
I found it quite strange
The way you said her name
And when you look in her eyes
I see the lust you can't deny
It's more to this than what you said
'Cause in your sleep, you called her name
You say she's just a friend
I knew right then 'cause the rain began, oh-oh

[Chorus]
An angel in disguise she was (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
But somehow you fell for her (You fell for her)
And though she broke your heart that day (She broke your heart)
And left you in the rain (Yeah)
But still, I love you (Oh, I love you, baby)
An angel in disguise she was (Oh, I'm with you, baby)
But somehow you fell for her (I'm ready for you, baby)
And though she broke your heart that day (And left you in the rain)
And left you in the rain (Yeah)
But still, I love you

[Verse 2]
She seemed so familiar the day that I met her
Who was she foolin'?
I had a clue of what she was doin'
Thoughts of suspicion brought to my attention
I fell in her game, and I'm so lost
Please stop the rain, oh-ooh

[Chorus]
An angel in disguise she was (Oh, you hurt me, babe)
But somehow you fell for her (Yeah, but I'm still here)
And though she broke your heart that day (Still lovin' you)
And left you in the rain
But still, I love you (Oh, I might be crazy, babe)
An angel in disguise she was (But I love you, babe)
But somehow you fell for her (Somehow you fell)
And though she broke your heart that day (She left you in the rain)
And left you in the rain
But still, I love you

[Bridge]
And when my music stops
And when my tears dry
And when the rain ends
My heart will beat again
And when my music stops
And when my tears dry
And when the rain ends
My heart will beat again (Ooh baby, oh, darlin')

[Chorus]
An angel in disguise she was (I know it hurts)
But somehow you fell for her (Oh-ooh)
And though she broke your heart that day (Broke your heart, oh)
And left you in the rain
But still, I love you (I love you)
An angel in disguise she was
But somehow you fell for her (Somehow you fell for her)
And though she broke your heart that day (She left you in the rain)
And left you in the rain
But still, I love you

[Outro]
I love you
I will never do the things she did
Take your heart and run away with it, no, no
'Cause I really, really love you (Still, I love you)
An angel in disguise she was
But somehow you fell for her
And though she broke your heart that day
And left you in the rain
But still, I love you

 

[Intro]
The boy is mine
The boy is mine
The boy is mine
The boy is mine
The boy is mine

[Spoken Prelude: Brandy & Monica]
- Excuse me, can I please talk to you for a minute?
- Uh-huh, sure. You know, you look kinda familiar
- Yeah, you do too. But um, I just wanted to know, do you know somebody named...? You, you know his name
- Oh yeah, definitely. I know his name
- Well, I just wanna let you know that he's mine
- Ha, no, no, he's mine!

[Chorus: Brandy]
You need to give it up
Had about enough
It's not hard to see
The boy is mine
I'm sorry that you
Seem to be confused
He belongs to me
The boy is mine

[Verse 1: Brandy & Monica]
I think it's time we got this straight
Let's sit and talk face to face
There is no way you could mistake
Him for your man, are you insane?
You see, I know that you may be
Just a bit jealous of me
But you're blind if you can't see
That his love is all in me
You see, I tried to hesitate
I didn't wanna say what he told me
He said without me, he couldn't make it
Through the day, ain't that a shame?
But maybe you misunderstood
'Cause I can't see how he could
Wanna change something that's so good
All my love was all it took (The boy is mine)

[Chorus: Brandy (& Monica)]
You need to give it up
Had about enough (Enough)
It's not hard to see (Oh)
The boy is mine (Boy is mine)
I'm sorry that you (Sorry that you)
Seem to be confused (Confused)
He belongs to me (Oh)
The boy is mine

[Verse 2: Monica & Brandy]
Must you do the things you do?
You keep on acting like a fool
You need to know it's me, not you
And if you didn't know it, girl, it's true
I think that you should realize
And try to understand why
He is a part of my life
I know it's killing you inside
You can say what you wanna say
What we have, you can't take
From the truth, you can't escape
I can tell the real from the fake
When will you get the picture?
You're the past, I'm the future
Get away, it's my time to shine
If you didn't know, the boy is mine, oh (The boy is mine, oh-oh)

[Chorus: Brandy]
You need to give it up
Had about enough (Enough)
It's not hard to see (To see)
The boy is mine (The boy is mine)
I'm sorry that you (Sorry that you)
Seem to be confused (Seem to be confused)
He belongs to me (He belongs to me)
The boy is mine (The boy is mine)

[Chorus: Brandy (& Monica)]
You need to give it up (Ooh)
Had about enough (Had about enough)
It's not hard to see
The boy is mine (He's mine, he's mine, he's mine, he's mine)
I'm sorry that you (I'm so sorry)
Seem to be confused (You seem to be confused)
He belongs to me (He belongs to me)
The boy is mine

[Bridge: Monica & Brandy]
I can't destroy this love I've found
Your silly games, I won't allow
The boy is mine without a doubt
You might as well throw in the towel
What makes you think that he wants you
When I'm the one that brought him to
The special place that's in my heart?
He was my love right from the start (The boy is mine)

[Chorus: Brandy, (Brandy & Monica)]
You need to give it up (Give it on up)
Had about enough (Had about enough)
It's not hard to see (It's not hard to see)
The boy is mine (The boy is mine, oh)
I'm sorry that you (I'm sorry that you)
Seem to be confused (Seem to be confused)
He belongs to me (He belongs to me)
The boy is mine (No, no)
You need to give it up (You need to give it up)
Had about enough (About enough)
It's not hard to see (It's not hard to see)
The boy is mine (The boy is mine)
I'm sorry that you (Mine, oh)
Seem to be confused (Seem to be confused)
He belongs to me (He belongs to me)
The boy is mine (The boy is mine)

[Outro: Brandy, (Brandy & Monica)]
You need to give it up (Not yours)
Had about enough (But mine, not yours)
It's not hard to see (But mine, not yours)
The boy is mine (But mine)
I'm sorry that you
Seem to be confused
He belongs to me
The boy is mine
