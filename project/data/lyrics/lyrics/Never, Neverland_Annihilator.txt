Disillusioned, self-confusion
Trying to make it through another day
What's it all for, when does it end
There must be another way

Woven webs of intricacy
A life of nothing new
No one here to understand
Pressure's crushing you

Sixes and sevens
Disorder battles control
Sixes and sevens
Crises overflow

Aggravation, deep frustration
I know what I want to do
Motivation is a problem
When it's driven out of you

Emotion, commotion's
Filling up the brain
Direction's null and void
Another drink dilutes the pain

Sixes and sevens
Disorder battles control
Sixes and sevens
Crises overflow

Sinking fast
Will it last
At sixes and sevens

Pulling through from yesterday
Another day is done
Determination
Self confidence has won

Woven webs of intricacy
Life is full of stress
That can only hinder
New desire to progress

Sixes and sevens
Disorder's lost control
Sixes and sevens
Crises down the hole

Sinking fast
In the past
At sixes and sevens

 

Stonewall - go to bat
Unless you want to live like that
Stonewall - can't we see
We're our own worst enemy

A land said to have all, wealth in land, in man
Qualities soon to exhaust as man's greed poisons the land
Streams, once fresh, were centres of life for so many a creature
Beauty without defence, polluted, never to replenish

Collage, blue and green, seen as golden industrial sites
Smudge as toxic pollutants destroy her remaining rights
The power of corporations, spewing chemicals into the air
Fines are imposed to discourage, but what's a dime to a millionaire

It's time to listen, and see the signs
It's time to listen and hear her cries

The one that gave us life is being burnt to the raw
Reaping unprotected riches, human nature's self-destruction flaw
The power of corporations, spewing chemicals into the air
Fines are imposed to discourage, but what's a dime to a millionaire
