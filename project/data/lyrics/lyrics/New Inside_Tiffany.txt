They say that moss won't grow
On a rolling stone
You can't catch a rising star
So I keep on running
Doesn't matter what people say
As long as I'm happy

Jump up turn around
Faster than the speed of sound
Follow me all over town
Never run my motor down

They say it's hard to hit
On a moving target
That's why I always quit
Before it's even started
Live my life the way I see
'Cause my time is for me

Jump up turn around
Faster than the speed of sound
Follow me all over town
Never run my motor down

Maybe one day
All my hopes and dreams will come true
But until they do...

 

Sometimes there's a time
When you must say goodbye
Though it hurts you must learn to try
I know I've got to let you go
But I know anywhere you go

You'll never be far
Cause like the light of a bright star
You'll keep shining in my life
You're gonna be right

Here in my heart
That's where you'll be
You'll be with me
Here in my heart
No distance can keep us apart
Long as you're here in my heart

Won't be any tears
Falling from those eyes
Cause when true love never dies
It says alive forever

Time can't take away what we have
I will remember our time together
You may think our time is through
But I'll still have you

Here in my heart
I know you'll be back again
And 'till then
My love is waiting
Here in my heart
