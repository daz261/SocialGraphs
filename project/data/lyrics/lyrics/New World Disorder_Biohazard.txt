Welcome to the rat race, people killing themselves
To get ahead of the pack, backstab and attack
Out for self, the money, the power, the fame
Competition and greed in a world without shame
I stumble and fall along the path I've chosen
I face my fears, I won't be broken
Corrosion has a way of fucking with your sanity
I do what I gotta to preserve my humanity

Switchback-taking life as each day comes
Switchback-facing fears, I never run
Switchback-never quit until I'm done
I'm the underdog and I will overcome

Confrontation can break you down to your very last compound
Beat you down, drag you round, break you
Refuse to bend, never ever let it take you
Over the edge where you can never break through
Overcome, switchback, stand strong alone
The good, the bad, the truth, the unknown
Locked up at war with the demons within
I fight to live, I live to win

The harder that I battle with lifes deceit
The stronger I stand on my own two feet
If I allow the world to assimilate my mind
Will my freedom be forever denied? Will I no longer be free in my mind?
Will my freedom be forever denied?
