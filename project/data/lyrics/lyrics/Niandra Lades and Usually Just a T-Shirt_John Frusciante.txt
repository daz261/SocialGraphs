[Guitar Intro]

My smile is a rifle
Won't you give it a try?
So you like the way we dance, baby?
When notes come to you
You know I love you

You're all I see-

My smile is a rifle
And what are you?
My smile is a rifle
And I'm pointing it at you
My smile is a rifle
You'll know when you bring me in from the rain
