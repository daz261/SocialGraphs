Kim and Julie:
You think yr a loser, baby
But you drive all the girls crazy
Yr not a too screwed up punk
Yr a total cali hunk
Yr whole life is disenchanted
Take yr looks from who will grant it
You still follow 'ol blues man
Yr nothing like them friend
Yr great, yr cute, yr smart, yr nice
Lou, 29 Mark, 22
Hey boys, take my advice
Writing songs in yr sleep
John, 29
Stop pretending yr a creep
Trent, 30
You say yr head's like a hole
But your tune has so much soul
You brought about another tour
Don't forget your four by four
Can't buy yr Miss Right
Many girls will spend the night
Stop thinkin' about the bitch who screwed ya
There's a million who would do ya
Yr great, yr cute, yr smart, yr nice
Beck, 24
Hey boys, take my advice
J, 29
You can play guitar like a dream
Page, 35
Perfect knack of all it seems (?)
Steve 29
Acting like a social retard
Can it really be that hard?
Shake their hands and smile
All willin' to bear yr child
State of rock is pathetic
Yr songs are prophetic
Yr a 20th century poet
Come on boy, don't ya know it?
