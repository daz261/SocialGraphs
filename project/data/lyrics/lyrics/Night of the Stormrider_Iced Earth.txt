As I travel through the astral planes
I see a break ahead
As though the sky has burst in flames
Before the storm I dread
Lightning breaks across the sky
Blackish blue at night
Riders ride on dismal clouds
I scream at Heaven's light

Storming Demons travel through the night
The time is almost here
I lay in a jacket of steel
My scream no-one hears

I can feel the storm approaching
The pain is its reality
The death I breathe is in the air
I feel no more, no longer care
Trumpets sound as I break free
The vision I see just can't be me
What is this that I have done?
Why am I the chosen one?

Fight on, grab on
Stormrider, stormrider
Fight on, grab on
Stormrider, stormrider

Now, the rider rides through the night
The time is almost here
As I lay wrapped in steel
My scream no-one hears
Help me through this Hell inside
My life's my own, it's my pride
Carry on, my solid dream
Save me from this horrid scream

Fight on, grab on
Stormrider, stormrider
Fight on, grab on
Stormrider, stormrider

 

During the last rays of the sacred moon
I walk the desolate terrain
So cold and all alone
The rider came to me
A black tornado, a violent mass
A cloud of evil rose
Now, I'm marked for all time

Temptation befell me
Darkness is calling for me
This is the path that I choose
This is the path that I

Forced power besieged in me
Showing vision of what could be
Now obsessed with my fate
I must go forth and conquer

The chosen one to lead the pack
This boiling hate has risen
From the depths of my blackened heart
This madness is my destiny

Temptation befell me
Darkness is calling for me
This is the path that I choose
This is the path that I choose
This is the path that I choose
This is the path that I
