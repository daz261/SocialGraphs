"Come closer morsel, for I smell your terror and I hunger"

Roaming path of sleeping dead reaching for untied
Journey of the desperation let to reveal
Joy with bleeding seared peachy with reason laid just back fault
Something it back to up something its forward
Darkness hiding behind those of black path of clad
Darkness standing in arches of hell fire ream
Meddles creating an end pushed rhythm of the time
Meddles spilling the blood of the burning awn
Silent just to dark on in not re-passion mysterious chain
Higher in the darkest clouds and turning to feeling of the dark you've pray
Claws in life, nothing seams the dark
Again sworn everything to come is creed
Walking come possession of the reaching full up fear
Journey of the desperation let to reveal
Time elector of the man it twisted some of blood
Something it back to up something its forward
Pay my darkly apart to be the pip what's crawling out
Coiling as the butterflies make you reborn
Murder sucks a matter dreams secret seen in hallow fee
Reaching end and can't before to confute here I'm fall
Farewell to life weacn light darkening

 

Crusting the gate of power desire
You wanna heist you was so blind
What prepared me in stood sow avouches
More are feed close your eyes
Forget to dark legion to trickle phantom
Beautiful light does make can shut closed
Now are push come to grow swim to moonlight
Trap here alone trying this shoved when awake
Down in forth come to Hell trait to moonlight
Down in beauty and make of the day out of time
To dark pleasure lout in mate beautiful north
To the gates we fore up to see we could fade away
Dream be freedom fulfilled, freedom forever laud in mach
Torn the pleasure move in dead to see what ever clout
Its great descend veil dark it trough
Torn for flesh we return here::."ATTA-ATTA"
Standing out and make be out it shut down
Its time to look the fate I am afeed you in black
Spay to motion in chaos finally screw would this stopped that laugh
Make ache of serpent's heart letting to scream splash down in fly ends
To fight to left and right land are winches this captured defeat
The perfect end in the down of your roam
Torn for flesh we are torn it up
