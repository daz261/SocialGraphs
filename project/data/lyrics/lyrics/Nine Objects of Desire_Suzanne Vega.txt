The sign said "Headshots"
And that was all
A picture of a boy
And a number you could call
Two eyes in the shade
A mouth so sad and small
It's strange the way a shadow
Can fall across the wall
And make the difference
In what you see
Ah...

He's just a poster, but
He's everywhere
A face under a street lamp
Ripped and hanging in the air
Turn the corner
And he's still there
Watching all the people
Who are passing unaware
Is there a judgement
In what he sees?
Ah...

On a day
As cold
And gray
As today...

The sign says "Headshots"
It's all I see
A boy becomes a picture
Of guilt and sympathy
And so I think of you
In memory
Of the days we were together
And I knew that you loved me
That was the difference
In what we see
But that's history...
Ah...

 

It won't do
To dream of caramel
To think of cinnamon
And long for you

It won't do
To stir a deep desire
To fan a hidden fire
That can never burn true

I know your name
I know your skin
I know the way
These things begin

But I don't know
How I would live with myself
What I'd forgive of myself
If you don't go

So goodbye
Sweet appetite
No single bite
Could satisfy

I know your name
I know your skin
I know the way
These things begin

But I don't know
How I would live with myself
What I would give of myself
If you don't go

It won't do
To dream of caramel
To think of cinnamon
And long for you
