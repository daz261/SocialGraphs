[Verse 1]
Hometown, same town blues
Same old walls closing in
Oh, what a life a mess can be
I'm sitting here thinking of you, won't you give
Any thought to me?

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, time won't wait
Better open the gate
Get out and start what needs to be done
It's winding down, there's much you missed
Working on that graveyard shift

[Chorus]
Well, I'm not saying there's nothing wrong
As the day comes along
If what I see is true I could learn to believe
Can't look away
The powers that be
Might take it all away
Together we'll burn, together we'll burn either way

[Verse 2]
Some say a land of paradise
Some say a land of pain
Well, which side are you looking from?
Some people have it all, and some have it all to gain

[Bridge]
Well a man in a tie'll bum your dime
'Fore he'll break his 20 dollar bill
There's plenty of reasons in this world
For movin' along or standing still

[Chorus]
But I'm not saying there's nothing wrong
As the day comes along
If what I see is true I could learn to believe
Can't look away
The powers that be
Might take it all away
Together we'll burn, together we'll burn either way

[Verse 3]
There's too much time spent looking for a reason
It seems the simple ones beat the most truth
Oh, what a life a mess can be
I'm sitting here thinking of you, won't you give
Give a thought to me

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, time won't wait
Better open the gate
Get out and start what needs to be done
It's winding down, there's much you missed
Working on that graveyard shift

[Chorus]
But I'm not saying there's nothing wrong
As the day comes along
If what I see is true I could learn to believe
Can't look away
The powers that be
Might take it all away
Together we'll burn, together we'll burn away

 

On liquor I spend my last dime

Sunday morning, 8 am
Just cursing myself again
Drinking like this one might be my last

Blurred memories of making toasts
To the cheapest beer and talk-show hosts
Funny then, but that's fading fast

Here's to waking up at night
Half-drunk in a ditch by the side of the road
You're still thinking

That you can't go on like this
Headed for a breakdown
You keep saying thanks for tomorrow, 'cause I can't live
Thanks for tomorrow, 'cause I've had enough

Well, it'd do me just fine to make it through the night
On liquor I spend my last dime

A worried man drinks a healthy drink
But he drinks nine or ten until he's done
Then he'll tell you his life story
But he won't stop until he's told you and everyone

Here's to waking up at night
Half-drunk in a ditch by the side of the road
And you're still thinking

That you can't go on like this
Before I break down
You keep saying thanks for tomorrow, 'cause I can't live
Thanks for tomorrow, 'cause I've had enough

Well, it'd do me just fine to make it through the night
On liquor I spend my last dime

Blurred memories of making toasts
To the cheapest beer and talk-show hosts
Funny then, but it's fading fast

Here's to waking up at night
Half-drunk in a ditch by the side of the road
You're still thinking

That you can't go on like this
Headed for a breakdown
You keep saying thanks for tomorrow, I can't live
Thanks for tomorrow, 'cause I've had enough

Well, it'd do me just fine to make it through the night
On liquor I spend my last dime

 

Well, it's funny how it all works out
Mad men in suits walking about
I'd like to change your point of view someday
But I feel my patience slipping away

Looks like it's time to lay this burden down
Stop messing around
Don't want to go to the grave without a sound
Give the soul a place a rest
Not to ride on the factory belt
Not to ride on the factory belt

You do all you can to just get by
With poison all around
It needs no disguise
You can see it on faces
Parcel at your door
You know there ain't no chance our respect is no more

Looks like it's time to lay this burden down
Stop messing around
Don't want to hurry to the grave in the ground
Give the soul a place a rest
Not to ride on the factory belt
Not to ride on the factory belt

I've heard it said
That after seven years of factory belt
It gets in your head

Looks like it's time to lay this burden down
Stop messing around
Don't want to hurry to the grave in the ground
Give the soul a place a rest
Not to ride on the factory belt
Not to ride on the factory belt

 

Persuaded, paraded, inebriated, in doubt
Still aware of everything life carries on without
Cause there's one too many faces with dollar sign smiles
I've gotta find the shortest path to the bar for a while

A long way from happiness
In a three-hour-away town
Whiskey bottle over Jesus
Not forever, just for now
Not forever, just for now

There's a trouble around, it's never far away
The same trouble's been around for a life and a day
I can't forget the sound, cause it's here to stay
The sound of people chasing money and money getting away

A long way from happiness
In a three-hour-away town
Whiskey bottle over Jesus
Not forever, just for now
Not forever, just for now

In between the dirt and disgust there must be
Some air to breathe and something to believe
"Liquor and Guns" the sign says quite plain
Somehow life goes on in a place so insane

A long way from happiness
In a three-hour-away town
Whiskey bottle over Jesus
Not forever, just for now
Not forever, just for now

 

A quarter after two
Sittin' in my car, watching
Waiting on a train
Ninety-seven flatcars
Loaded down with troop trucks and tanks
Rolling by

I'm twenty-one, and I'm scared as hell
I quit school, I'm healthy as a horse
Because of all that I'll be the first one to die in a war

The whole damn town was sleeping
Dreaming the same dream
The radio was playing
Roger McGuinn singing
"To each and every thing there's a time and a season"

I'm twenty-one, and I'm scared as hell
I quit school, I'm healthy as a horse
Because of all that I'll be the first one to die in a war

Yes, I have the right to say
We all die anyway
But I'd just like to know
Where does my dying go
What for
What for

 

[Verse 1]
Never again
Your so-called friend
Will leave you
Sick and dry
This friend has a name
Knows the gutter and shame
This so-called friend of you and I

[Verse 2]
Oh, great soul
The long-term goals
Are to leave this friend behind
He knows what I lack
Is a place under the sack
For every other tie that binds

[Chorus 1]
This last night on the town
Might be your last above ground
And you think to yourself
"There must be a better way
Than the same routine
For more than once
You pay"
More than once, you pay

[Verse 3]
Butt full of lead
Stuck in your web
Held captive by the stream
The thoughts in your head
They made a nice bed
And you still had time to dream

[Chorus 2]
This last night on the town
Might be your last above ground
And you smile
At things and wave goodbye
More excuses
To never even try
As you wave goodbye

[Verse 4]
Forget what I said
Your friend's not dead
He's only gone for a while
Come back to that crack
Between what's white and what's black
And give you one last smile

[Chorus 1]
This last night on the town
Might be your last above ground
And you think to yourself
"There must be a better way
Than the same routine
For more than once
You pay"
More than once, you pay

 

John Hardy, he was a desperate little man
Carried two guns every day
Shot a man down by the West Virginia line
They saw John Hardy get away
They saw John Hardy get away

They cornered John Hardy on the Tombstone bridge
He thought that he was free
'Til the deputy sheriff came and grabbed him by the arm
Said "Johnny, come along with me"
"Johnny, come along with me"

John Hardy, he stood inside his cell
Tears running down his eyes
Said "I've seen the death of many a poor boy
Now I'm ready to die
Now I'm ready to die"

Well, I've been to the east and I've been to the west
I've been the whole world round
I've been to the north and I've been to the south
Now I'm going to my hanging ground
I'm going to my hanging ground
