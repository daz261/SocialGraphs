[Verse 1]
Let's electrocute
Send ourselves in
Constant airwaves ringing out from voice to ear
To free ourselves from...

[Chorus]
There's an army charged
Ready
Armed to educate
And demonstrate
To the masses
To the people
Left in the dark
With blinders on
Not holding back to activate
Never holding back to activate
In rebellion

[Verse 2]
A full-fledged pledge
(To save ourselves)
To eradicate the authorities that hold themselves higher
(From those who hate)
A full-fledged pledge
(Our ways of freedom)
To liberate the minorities who only want their rights
(Expression in rebellion)

[Chorus]
There's an army charged
Ready
Armed to educate
(To save ourselves)
And demonstrate
To the masses
To the people
Left in the dark
(From those who hate)
With blinders on
Not holding back to activate
(From those who hate our ways of freedom)
Never holding back to activate
In rebellion

 

[Verse 1]
We've seen some real hard times
And I hope the hardest are behind
But there will be times when it will seem
Like we are caught someplace in between
The ocean and the storm without a shore

[Pre-Chorus]
We'll find our own way home
And sing out every song we know
No one can keep us down

[Chorus]
And who gives a fuck what anybody says
We'll live and love until we're dead
Holding on to what we've come to know
And on and on and on and on
And every time you hear this song be sure you're not alone

[Pre-Chorus]
We'll find our own way home
And sing out every song we know
No one can keep us down

[Chorus]
And who gives a fuck what anybody says
We'll live and love until we're dead
Holding on to what we've come to know
And on and on and on and on
And every time you hear this song be sure you're not alone
