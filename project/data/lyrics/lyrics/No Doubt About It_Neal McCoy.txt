We've crossed deeper rivers

We've climbed higher mountains

We've faced harder times, and worked it out

Now that things are better, you tell me your leaving

I'm just trying to understand somehow

Why now?

I could understand you leaving years ago

But the hard times seem to only bring us close

Did you have to come this far, to just walk out

Why now?

Remember how we struggled, we worked so hard to make it

I tried to give you everything, you dreamed about

But now you want something, that i don't want to give you

How can i let you go, when i don't know how

Why now?

I could understand you leaving years ago

But the hard times seem to only bring us close

Did you have to come this far to just walk out

Why now?

How can i let you go, when i don't know now

Why now?

Why now?
