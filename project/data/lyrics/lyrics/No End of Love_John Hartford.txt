[Verse 1]
I'd like to go where you go
And see the things you see
I'd like to hear the sounds you hear
And breathe the air you breathe
And hurt for you in times of pain
And smile when things are right again
Love you like there was no end of love
No end of love

[Verse 2]
With you I'd like to do the things, that I have done before
But have a different meaning now
That wasn't there before
As if I started out a new
Just when I stumbled on to you
For now my dreams divide in two for you
No end to love

[Verse 3]
I'd like to sing the songs you sing
And play the games you play
I'd like to walk the road you walk
And let you lead the way
I'd like to get the notes you send
And keep you dry from a summer's rain
I love you like there was no end of love
No end of love

[Verse 4]
With you I'd like to do the things
That I have done before
That have a different meaning now
That wasn't there before
As if I started out anew
Just when I stumbled on to you
For now my dreams divide in two for you
No end of love
