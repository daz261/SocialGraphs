You may find my appearance and demeanor foolish, but it is you that plays the fool
For although I am only a student of the victim, I have many, many styles
Try my choking style! HWAH!

--Shaolin Puff'n'Stuff (I have no idea)

Every time you humored me
You patronized my misery
The yesterdays mean nothing now
They never mattered anyhow!

Oh well in hell, we like it well
We think it's nice, we think it's swell!
I've fucked up so many times
The more I think, the more I sink...

Into the drain...
Of pain and misery
The sickness of feeling...
Will end someday

Often times I wonder why
There's love and hate, there's live or die
When sickness comes I must decide:
When feelings go, there's suicide

Oh well in hell, we like it well
We think it's nice, we think it's swell!
We'll drink a cup of kindness yet
In hell we learn but soon forget...

Hell is life. You must admit this is true...
But don't take it so serious
It ends so soon

IN HELL!
OH WELL!
