Call me ready, call me ready or not
And I'll say yeah! yeah! yeah!
Give it all I got
Call me in the morning, when I'm half asleep
River's runnin' high on the mountain deep

Call me deadly, call me deadly serious
And I'll say yeah, yeah, yeah!
I couldn't care enough
Call me when you want to control the vice
I'll defend your honor when you roll the dice

Do you want to play house, do you want to play house
Playin' in the house of love?
Do you want to play house, do you want to play house
Playin' in the house, playin' in the house of love

Call me over, call me over the top
And I'll say yeah, yeah, yeah!
Never wanna stop

Call me on hire when you're in your shell
Wanna be your fire, wanna ring your bell

Do you wanna play house, do you wanna play house
Playin' in the house of love
Do you wanna play house, do you wanna play house
Playin' in the house, playin' in the house of love?

Call me never, call me never say die
And I'll say yeah, yeah, yeah!
Take me alive
Call me undercover when you bake your bread
Wanna be your lover, wanna make your bed

Do you wanna play house...

 

Good days, bad days
Tearin' up the freeways
Runnin' in the big race, gotta get on
She's comin' on strong
There's something goin' on
It's the same old song but I gotta get on

Doin' this, doin' that, sleepin' on a doormat
Gotta make a comeback, maybe tonight
When it gets insane and I'm losin' my brain
But I'm makin' my name
Gotta do it tonight

She really fooled me
She got me right between the eyes
She pushed me pulled me
She got me right between the eyes
