[Verse 1]
I can't imagine, any greater fear
Then wakin' up, without you here
And though the sun would still shine on
My whole world, would all be gone
But not for long

[Chorus]
If I had to run, if I had to crawl
If I had to swim a hundred rivers, just to climb a thousand walls
Always know that I would find a way, to get to where you are
There's no place that far

[Verse 2]
It wouldn't matter why we're apart
Lonely miles or two stubborn hearts
Nothin' short of God above
Could turn me away from your love
I need you that much

[Chorus]
If I had to run, if I had to crawl
If I had to swim a hundred rivers, just to climb a thousand walls
Always know that I would find a way, to get to where you are
There's no place that far

[Violin Solo]

[Chorus]
Oh, if I had to run (If I had to run), if I had to crawl (If I had to crawl)
If I had to swim a hundred rivers, just to climb a thousand walls
Always know that I would find a way, to get to where you are
There's no place that far

[Outro]
Baby, there's no place that far
