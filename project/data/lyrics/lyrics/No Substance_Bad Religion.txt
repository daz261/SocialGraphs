[Verse 1]
Here inside this quiet room, there's direction
Outside in the sultry noontime, reflection
A million people scurry, they're looking for advice
None willing to lend charity, just exercise their

[Chorus]
Shades of truth and partisan conventions
Shades of truth between disparate lines
Shades of truth interpret my intentions
You don't know I'm alright

[Verse 2]
Who authored the blueprints and made us captains?
Someone proclaimed creation, people listened
While children, by the millions, are thrown into this zoo
The so-called gift of clarity! Oh, what was God up to?

[Chorus]
Shades of truth and lenient conventions
Shades of truth, between disparate lines
Shades of truth interpret my intentions
You don't know I'm alright

[Verse 3]
So many walk in parallel and pull their blinders tight
So few offer apology and accept others rights
And nothing absolutely can be cherished in the end
But can't we all accept that it will all happen again?

[Chorus]
Shades of truth and partisan conventions
Shades of truth between disparate lines
Shades of truth interpret my intentions
You don't know I'm alright

 

[Verse 1]
England
Seemed like such a beautiful place from afar
Until one day
I saw how miserable things really are

[Chorus]
All fantastic images
They only are apparent
Propagated just by hope
And desire to share it

[Verse 2]
Beauty
Was the allure that brought me close to you
Loneliness
Was the bond that made me stick like glue

[Chorus]
All fantastic images
They only are apparent
Promoted by desperate hope
That things are somewhere better

[Bridge]
I don't have a thing against fantasy
But to chase it down just don't make sense to me
If your only hope is simply peace and love
You end up discarding most of what you're made of

[Chorus]
All fantastic images
They only are apparent
Propagated just by hope
And desire to share it
