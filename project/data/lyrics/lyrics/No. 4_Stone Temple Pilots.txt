[Verse 1]
Falling downward with a flaming hand
I knew the questions but I lost the answers
I'll hold the world for all
I'll hold it for all
As long as no one asks no questions
I got the message
And the message stood

[Chorus]
One, two, three
I've got another, got another
One, two, three
I got another, got another
I got another hit that held me the last time
Don't ya know what I mean boys?
One, two, three
I've got another, got another

[Verse 2]
Falling fast but doing all I can
I know the questions but I lost the answers
I got the message and the message stood

[Chorus]
One, two, three
I've got another, got another
One, two, three
I got another, got another
I got another hit that held me the last time
Don't ya know what I mean boys?
One, two, three
I've got another, got another

[Verse 3]
Lease the one who makes it
Profit from the riddle
Kill the one that breaks it
Always in the middle
Keep the dream alive
With sleeping pills you shouldn't fiddle
Lease the one who makes it
Profit from the riddle
I got the message but I lost the race
I got the message but I lost the race

[Chorus]
One, two, three
I've got another, got another
One, two, three
I got another, got another
I got another hit that held me the last time
Don't ya know what I mean boys?
One, two, three
I've got another, got another
