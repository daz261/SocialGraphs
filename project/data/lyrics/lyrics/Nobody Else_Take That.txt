Every guy needs a girl like you
Every girl needs a guy like me, oh yeah
Every guy needs a guy like you, like you
See 'cause that's how it's meant to be

OK so I've stared a little long
You can take my body, take my fingers and my tongue
Oh you move like you know what's coming next
Touching me, touching you, touching all around your legs
I need you, I need you, I need you you you you you
Get the message now, I've got to have you girl

[Chorus]
Every guy needs a girl like you
Every girl needs a guy like me
Every guy needs a guy like you
See cause that's how it's meant to be

Shall I come over, shall I wait a little more?
How much longer till I walk you through that door?
Don't hold back the feeling we all know lies deep inside
It won't be long now till your heart is open wide
I need you, I need you, I need you you you you you
Get the message now, I've got to have you girl

[Chorus]
