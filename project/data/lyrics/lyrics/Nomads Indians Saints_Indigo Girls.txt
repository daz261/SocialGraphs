Welcome me to your city of angels
Devil prophets still hold my hand
I walked your stillborn streets for hours
Ethnic echoes spitting out their trials
They tell me i'll be the first to praise the sun
The first to praise the moon
The first to hold the lone coyote
The last to set it free

Welcome me to a haven given
It's well received into my open arms
Oh i ran in my sleep through shaking tremors
I felt the splitting earth echoing in my ears
I feel it i'll be the first to praise the sun
The first to praise the moon
The first to hold the lone coyote
The last to set it free

Welcome me to your city of angels
There's a devil monkey laying on our backs
Now tell me where's the heart
Where's the bullet for breaking
Who's gonna give me a weapon
A pacifying weapon
I need it i'll be the first to praise the sun
The first to praise the moon oh
The first to hold the lone coyote
The last to set it free
I'll be the first to praise the sun
I said i said welcome me
The first to praise the moon oh
The first to hold the lone coyote
The last to set it free
I said welcome me

 

[Verse 1]
I'm coming home with a stone
Strapped onto my back
I'm coming home with a burning hope
Turning all my blues to black
I'm looking for a sacred hand
To carve into my stone
A ghost of comforts, angel's breath
To keep this life inside my chest

[Chorus]
This world falls on me
Hopes of immortality
Everywhere I turn
All the beauty just keeps shaking me

[Verse 2]
Now I woke up in the middle of a dream
Scared the world was too much for me
Sejarez said, "Don't let go
Just plant the seeds and watch them grow"
I've slept in rainy canyon lands
Cold drenched to my skin
I always wake to find a face
To calm these troubled lands

[Chorus]
Ah this world falls on me
With dreams of immortality
Everywhere I turn
All the beauty just keeps shaking me

[Bridge]
Now I'm running
To the end of the earth
And I'm swimming
To the edge of the sea
And I'm laughing
I'm under a starry sky
This world was meant for me
Don't bury me
Carry me

[Verse 3]
I wish I was a nomad
An Indian or a saint
The edge of death would disappear
Leave me nothing left to taint
I wish I was a nomad
An Indian or a saint
Give me walking shoes
Feathered arms
And a key to heaven's gate

[Chorus]
Ah this world falls on me
Dreams of immortality
Everywhere I turn
All the beauty just keeps shaking me

[Outro: Amy & Emily]
I'm running
This world falls on me
To the end of the earth
With hopes of immortality
I'm swimming
Everywhere I turn
To the edge of the sea
The beauty just keeps shaking me
And i'm laughing
This world falls on me
'Cause i'm under a starry sky
Hopes of immortality
This world was meant for me
Everywhere I turn
I've got hopes of immortality

 

[Verse 1]
Maybe we'll make Texas by the morning
Light the bayou with our taillights in the night
Eight hundred miles to El Paso from the state line
And we never have the money for the flight
I'm in the back seat sleepy from the travel
We played our hearts out all night long in New Orleans
And dirty from the diesel fumes, drinking coffee black
When the first breath of Texas comes in clean

[Chorus]
And there's something 'bout the Southland in the springtime
Where the waters flow with confidence and reason
Though I miss her when I'm gone
It won't ever be too long
'Til i'm home again to spend my favorite season
When God made me born a Yankee he was teasin'
There's no place like home and none more pleasin'
Than the Southland in the springtime

[Verse 2]
In Georgia nights are softer than a whisper
Beneath a quilt somebody's mother made by hand
With the farmland like a tapestry
Passed down through generations
And the peach trees stitched across the land
There'll be cider up near Helen off the roadside
And boiled peanuts in a bag to warm your fingers
And the smoke from the chimneys meets its maker in the sky
With a song that winter wrote whose melody lingers

[Chorus]
And there's something 'bout the Southland in the springtime
Where the waters flow with confidence and reason
Though I miss her when I'm gone
It won't ever be too long
'Til I'm home again to spend my favorite season
When God made me born a Yankee he was teasin'
There's no place like home and none more pleasin'
Than the Southland in the springtime
