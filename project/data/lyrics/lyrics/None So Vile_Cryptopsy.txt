[Verse 1]
Pardon, please, the narrow
Confinement of your limbs;
Unfortunately, it's necessary
For your correction;
Shriek to your heart's
Content, if you wish;
I promise you pain and
Nightmares, in that sequence

[Verse 2]
Permit me to introduce you to
"Tuesday"...
I favor her, this pretty blade
So tall and fine;
Hatred and violence are not
Our ways, but firm we are;
Squirming is useless, so is this colon
Cry for me

[Verse 3]
Svelte is implement
Its gentle caress lets you bleed;
Its subtle curvature
Dancing, deeply slit your guts

[Verse 4]
It's for your own good;
You need guidance, I provide;
What is your pleasure? This is mine;
A welcome change!

 

Sextons of the churchyard
Have seen unblessed things;
Ground no longer hallowed
Has sprouted new graves

Descendants of clan
That unsurped maternity
Hear whispers in their blood;
This summons of the Fathers

Adherence to the principle
Of "man by woman born"...
Anachronistic ritual
Soon to be obsolete

"Forgive me Father
For I know not what I do;
My grave beckons
As irresistable as drawing breath."

Nature abhors a vacuum
The same is true to a tomb...
It cannot be empty
A barren womb of plenty...
A vacant grave must be filled
For this the Fathers' will
Material birth be abjure
A mother's cunt is unpure

Sired in blasphemy
In nocturnal obeisance to rotted hearts
Filled with necrolatry
Reverse the life cycle be reborn through Death

"Forgive me Father
For I know not what I do;
I leave a void to fill one
Hear my prayers from far below."
