I
Alone i fill my head
With
Everything i have
See
Into my empty face
Scarred
I know i'll never be

You're all the power in my fucked-up feelings
Worn out by frayed old visions
I know i am you too
So i wear your mission
Mark my every step
And i choke my lonely breath so i can bear my seed

Slay
Well i do know my hand
Obey
I look into myself
Crawling
Ragged in my brain
I'm
No enemy to me

I am the hate you made of flesh and blood
I am the man you ate
Now left your sour embark
My solitude fill up with pain
Beloved enemy you never betray

I know you
Still i pay
Simple way
Go insane
I don't beg
Never i choose
Will i ever
I'm still you

Chaos is the way you drain me into be you
Last traces of the me
Converted by your rein
Merge into an indigestible pestilent trip
Seasons of infinity
Inhabitant of pain

Incorporeal sense can't resist what i need
Spirits to release my power
Reckon i'm beyond recuperation
Swallow every hour
Here i stand in the middle of my entity
Revile my head
You're all i have and i ask your feelings
Ritual
Ritual

Hand in hand
Back to back
Yearning to
To obey

See
I go insane
Me
Your only friend
I
Never run away
Hate
You're all i ever have

You know i am seeing your realm at my bed
Our love never ending
You run my head
See i was made for you
You roll my mind away
Embedded in hate
You're all i have
You're all i have
