[Verse 1]
Light comes in I watch you wake
Wanting you so much my heart could break
To touch your skin, to feel your hair
I'd follow you anywhere

[Verse 2]
Light goes out I watch you sleep
Never imagine love so deep
I close my eyes to breath the air
I'd follow you anywhere

[Chorus 1]
In the waves that wash over me, wash over you
Follow me, I'll follow you
Through your dreams to secret places
Here's my hand just take it
Do as I do
I'll follow you

[Verse 3]
Nobody knows who made the stars
Baby the whole world is ours
From Liverpool to Leicester Square
I'd follow you anywhere

[Chorus 2]
Angels that watch over me, watch over you
Follow me, I'll follow you
Through your dreams to secret places
Where nobody can trace us
We'll make it through
I'll follow you

[Bridge]
I'll follow you
I'll follow you
I'll follow you
I'll follow you
I'll follow you

[Chorus 1]
In the waves that wash over me, wash over you
Follow me, I follow you
When nobody can find you
I'll be right behind you
You make it through
I follow you

[Outro]
Follow me
I'll follow you
Through your dreams to secret places
Here's my hand just take it
Do as I do
I'll follow you
