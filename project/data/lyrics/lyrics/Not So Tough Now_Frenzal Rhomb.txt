I can see the pain in your eyes
As you try to comprehend your way of life
And I don't think I'm a failure at something
I haven't done yet
I'd be like you if I needed to
I know that you just want me to be happy
As long as that happiness coincides
With your stylised distortions of my values
And a work ethic that no longer applies

We don't want to work too hard
Just accept the way we are
It's your disappointment tearing us apart

Can't you understand this is our time
It's not a phase we're getting on just fine
It's easier to talk about redemption
Than questionable backwards moral lines
It might just be academic pretensions
Or justifying when to fantasise

We don't want to work too hard
Just accept the way we are
It's your disappointment tearing us apart

I can see the pain in your eyes
As you try to comprehend your way of life
I know that you just want me to be happy
As long as that happiness coincides
With your stylised distortions of my values
And work ethic that no longer applies

We don't want to work too hard
Just accept the way we are
It's the disappointment tearing us apart
