[Verse 1]
Bartender I may sit here on this barstool all night long
But I won't need much attention, I just need some time alone
So, if you'll give me some quarters and a bottle of your best
You can just sit back and let the jukebox do the rest

[Chorus]
Give it to me Strait
Sing "Am I Blue" while I sit here and cry
And tell me how my baby's gotten
So good at goodbye
It's gonna take a fireman
To put this old flame out
So, come on give it to me Strait
Before I come unwound

[Verse 2]
Let's start off nice and easy, somethin' like "If I Know Me"
And we'll work our way up slowly to "Fool Hearted Memory"
Yeah. I've got all night long to sit right here and fall apart
So. don't leave out one single song, I know them all by broken heart

[Chorus]
Give it to me Strait
Sing, "Am I Blue" while I sit here and cry
And tell me how my baby's gotten
So good at goodbye
It's gonna take a fireman
To put this old flame out
So, come on give it to me Strait
Before I come unwound

[Bridge]
There ain't one country singer
That ain't good for a bad heartache
And for me there's nothin' smoother
Than a good stiff shot of Strait

[Outro]
It's gonna take a fireman
To put this old flame out
So, come on give it to me Strait
Before I come unwound
So, come on give it to me Strait
Before I come unwound
