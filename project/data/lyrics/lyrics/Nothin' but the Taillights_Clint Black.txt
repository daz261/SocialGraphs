The older you get the more you stand to lose
You can bet that we'll all have our turn
If I lost everything right down to my shoes
As long as you love me, I won't be concerned

There's one thing in life that I can't replace
It's written in ways, even time can't erase
Some things really are too good to be true
That something in my life is you

Now I've spent my time on money and things
That won't do a heart any good
With nothing to gain but the space that it brings
Which had always been empty, till I understood

There's one thing in life that I can't replace
It's written in ways, even time can't erase
Some things really are too good to be true
That something in my life is you

One thing's for certain and without a doubt
Your love is something I can't live without

Some things really are too good to be true
That something in my life, one thing in my life
That something in my life is you
