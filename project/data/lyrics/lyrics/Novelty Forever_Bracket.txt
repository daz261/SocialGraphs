Restful Garden, take my sweat and plant it in the ground
Restful Garden, take my life and turn it upside down

When it starts getting old
I'll stop doing what I'm told
When I start growing old

Secret Garden, take my secret, tell it to someone
Secret Garden, you're to blame for all the things I've done

When it starts getting old
I'll stop doing what I'm told
When I start growing old
Rain

Selfish Garden, take what you want like you always do
Selfish Garden, take some comfort knowing I need you

When it starts getting old
I'll stop doing what I'm told
When I start growing old
Rain

 

I'll fill you in on my philosophy
Can't wait to tell you about life's tragedies

And the coffee bean will burn inside of me
We can take a walk to the coffee shop and bitch about life for a while

Read me a book, enlighten me to death
Show me your espresso dreams when you're depressed

And the coffee bean will burn inside of me
We can take a walk to the coffee shop and bitch about life for a while

It's OK. I'm awake. And it seems like I've been that way for a week
I'm all right. Say good night. If you wake me up I'll never go to sleep

Twenty-six years old, I'm feeling sixty-five
One drink from your cup I'll prove that I'm alive

And the coffee bean will burn inside of me
We can take a walk to the coffee shop and bitch about life for a while
