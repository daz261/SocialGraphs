[Verse 1]
And I can hear you calling my name
Your healing hands smooth away the pain
And I can hear you whispering it'll be alright
You'll stay until the night breaks into day

[Chorus]
You are my light in the dark
You stand beside me
You take my hand, show the way
You're here to guide me
You give me the strength that I need
You give me shelter
You gave me life, you give me love
You are my mother

[Verse 2]
And when you hear me calling your name (I hear your voice)
You touch me with your chosen words
Everlasting faith, everlasting love is the greatest gift you have
Believing, understanding me

[Chorus]
You are my light in the dark
You stand beside me
You take my hand, show the way
You're here to guide me
You give me the strength that I need
You give me shelter
You gave me life, you give me love
You are my mother

[Bridge]
Closer, closer
Closer to heaven, are you
Closer, closer
Closer to heaven, are you
Closer, closer
Closer to heaven, are you, yeah

[Chorus]
You are my light in the dark (You, you are all my light)
You take my hand, show me the way
You give me the strength that I need (Yes, I need you)
You gave me life, you give me love
You are my light in the dark
Take my hand, show me the way
You give me the strength that I need (Yes, I need you)
You gave me life, you give me love (Oh, I love you, love you)
You are my light in the dark
You take my hand, show me the way
