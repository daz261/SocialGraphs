Summer dress makes you more beautiful than the rest
Loveliest girl that I know, and the sweetest
Spends her life inside, she thinks she isn't blessed

Summer dress separates you from the rest
Easiest days of her life have been spent
Wonders if she is loved, if she is missed

Says a prayer as she's kissed by ocean mist
Takes herself to the sand and dreams

Says a prayer as she's kissed by ocean mist
Takes herself to the sand and dreams

 

Somewhere up fifteen miles
Sifting through crackling vinyl
Lost memories of my youth
Are coming into view

Between lost hills divide
Quietly we sleep inside
Lost summers of my youth
I spent them all with you

Take ways by withered creeks
Lizards sunning in the streets
Small kitten stretches through
Green empty yards you knew

Weekend in san geronimo
Love how the starlit skies show
Weekend in san geronimo
Sentiment within me glows

Somewhere up fifteen miles
Barefoot on kitchen tile
Where nights are warm and true
I'll spend them all with you

Weekend in san geronimo
Love how the starlit skies show
Weekend in san geronimo
Sentiment within me glows
