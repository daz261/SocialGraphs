Don't tell me you're not happy here
And that it don't mean a thing
You're waiting for a better deal
But that is not my scene
Cause if you live for later
But not today
You're gonna miss a lot of wonderful things
So just investigate it
It's not too late
Don't underestimate the wonder of this

Only one that ever makes me feel totally heavenly
Ever wondered what would make you feel heavenly yeah

I'm finding a new side to you
You're a quite a discover
I'm finding out
I'm starry-eyed
And money don't mean a thing
Cause if you live with someone
You find a way
To understand that it's about give and take
And if you give to someone
You start to see
The opportunity's too good to throw away

Only one that ever makes me feel totally heavenly
Ever wondered what would make you feel heavenly yeah

Dream the dream girl
Let it take you there
A lake of heaven for the two of us to share
Ground beneath you
Gonna disappear
Leave the real world now and
Let it take you there

 

[Verse 1]
You told me not to make you wait
Then you don't call for days
You told me not to be too late
Then you don't come to me

[Pre-Chorus]
How many times you're gonna let me down?
You're keeping me hanging on at sea
And wrapped around your finger
Never believed that I'd ever find myself
Looking up to the upper hand and
Loving every minute, baby

[Chorus]
I won't mind
Ain't gonna give up as long as I
Don't mi-o-mind
Don't wanna quit after all this time
I won't mind
Ain't gonna give up as long as I
Don't mi-o-mind
Don't wanna quit after all this time

[Verse 2]
Totally lost the way you came
Rainbow coloured day
Hopin' not the way you changed
Then it all starts to fade

[Pre-Chorus]
How many times you're gonna let me down?
You're keeping me hanging on at sea
And wrapped around your finger
Never believed that I'd ever find myself
Looking up to the upper hand and
Loving every minute, baby

[Chorus]
I won't mind
Ain't gonna give up as long as I
Don't mi-o-mind
Don't wanna quit after all this time
I won't mind
Ain't gonna give up as long as I
Don't mi-o-mind
Don't wanna quit after all this time

[Pre-Chorus]
How many times you're gonna let me down?
You're keeping me hanging on at sea
And wrapped around your finger
Never believed that I'd ever find myself
Looking up to the upper hand and
Loving every minute, baby

[Chorus]
I won't mind
Ain't gonna give up as long as I
Don't mi-o-mind
Don't wanna quit after all this time
I won't mind
Ain't gonna give up as long as I
Don't mi-o-mind
Don't wanna quit after all this time
I won't mind
Ain't gonna give up as long as I
Don't mi-o-mind
Don't wanna quit after all this time
I won't mind
Ain't gonna give up as long as I
Don't mi-o-mind
Don't wanna quit after all this time
I won't mind
Ain't gonna give up as long as I
Don't mi-o-mind
Don't wanna quit after all this time
I won't mind
Ain't gonna give up as long as I
Don't mi-o-mind
Don't wanna quit after all this time
