[Verse 1]
In her place, one hundred candles burning
Her salty sweat drips from her breast
Her hips move and I can feel what they're sayin', swayin'
They say the beast inside of me is gonna get ya, get ya, yeah...

Yeah...

[Verse 2]
Black lipstick stains her glass of red wine
I am your servant, may I light your cigarette?
Those lips move, yeah, I can feel what you're sayin', prayin'
They say the beast inside of me is gonna get ya, get ya, yeah...

[Verse 3]
I beg to serve, your wish is my law
Now close those eyes and let me love you to death
Shall I prove I mean what I'm sayin', beggin'
I say the beast inside of me is gonna get ya, get ya, yeah...

[Chorus]
Ah...
Let me love you to...
Ah...
Let me love you to...
Death
To death...

[Chorus]
Ah...
Let me love you to...
Ah...
Let me love you to...
Death
To death...

[Bridge]
Am I good enough...
For you?
Am I good enough...
For you?
Am I...ah...
For you?
Am I....ah...
For you?

[Outro]
Am I good enough
For you?
