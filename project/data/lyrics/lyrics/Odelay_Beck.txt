[Verse 1]
It takes a backwash man to sing a backwash song
Like a frying pan when the fire's gone
Driving my pig while the band's taking pictures in the grass
And my radio smashed
And I like pianos in the evening sun
Dragging my heels 'til my day is done
Saturday night in the captain's clothes
Tin horns blowing with my jewelry froze

[Chorus]
Yo soy un disco quebrado
Yo tengo chicle en el cerebro

[Verse 2]
I can't believe my way back when
My Cadillac pants growing much too fast
Karaoke weekend at the suicide shack
Community service and I'm still the mack
Shocked my finger, spots on my hand
I been spreading disease all across the land
Beautiful air-conditioned
Sittin' in the kitchen
Wishing I was living like a hitman
Face down in the guarantees
Jaundiced honchos gettin' busy with me
Because I get down, I get down
I get down all the way

[Chorus]
Yo soy un disco quebrado
Yo tengo chicle en el cerebro

[Verse 3]
Sawdust songs of the plaid bartenders
Western Unions of the country westerns
Silverfoxes looking for romance
In the chain-smoke Kansas flashdance ass pants
And you got the hotwax residues
You never lose in your razorblade shoes
Stealing pesos out of my brain
Hazard signs down the Alamo lanes
Radar systems piercing the souls
You never get caught with the wax so rotten
All my days I got the grizzly words
Hijacked flavors that I'm flipping like birds

[Chorus]
Yo soy un disco quebrado
Yo tengo chicle en el cerebro

[Outro]
Who are you?
I'm the enchanting wizard of rhythm
Why did you come here?
I came here to tell you about the rhythms of the universe

 

[Verse 1]
You only got one finger left
And it's pointing at the door
And you're taking for granted
What the Lord's laid on the floor
So I'm picking up the pieces
And I'm putting them up for sale
Throw your meal ticket out the window
Put your skeletons in jail

[Chorus]
'Cause Lord only knows it's getting late
Your senses are gone so don't you hesitate
To give yourself a call
Let your bottom dollars fall
Throwing your two bit cares down the drain

[Verse 2]
Invite me to the seven seas
Like some seasick man
You'll do whatever you please
And I'll do whatever I can
Titanic, fare thee well
My eyes are turning pink
Don't call us when the new age
Gets old enough to drink

[Chorus]
'Cause Lord only knows it's getting late
Your senses are gone so don't you hesitate
To move on up the hill
There's nothing dead left to kill
Throwing your two bit cares down the drain

[Bridge]
Odelay, odelay, odelay, odelay
Odelay, odelay
Just passing through
Odelay, odelay, odelay, odelay

[Outro]
Going back to Houston
Do the hotdog dance
Going back to Houston
To get me some pants
