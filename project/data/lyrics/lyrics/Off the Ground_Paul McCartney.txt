[Verse 1]
I saw a cat with a machine in his brain
The man who fed him said he didn't feel any pain
I'd like to see that man take out that machine
And stick it in his own brain
You know what I mean

[Verse 2]
I saw a rabbit with its eyes full of tears
The lab that owned her had been doing it for years
Why don't we make them pay for every last eye
That couldn't cry its own tears?
Do you know what I mean?

[Chorus]
When I tell you that we'll all be
Looking for changes
Changes in the way we treat our fellow creatures
And we will learn how to grow

[Guitar solo]

[Chorus]
When I tell you that we'll all be
Looking for changes
Changes in the way we treat our fellow creatures
And we will learn how to grow
Yeah, when we're looking for changes

[Verse 3]
I saw a monkey that was learning to choke
A guy beside him gave him cigarettes to smoke
And every time that monkey started to cough
The bastard laughed his head off
Do you know what I mean?

[Chorus]
When I tell you that we'll all be
Looking for changes
Changes in the way we treat our fellow creatures
And we will learn how to grow
When we're looking for changes

[Outro]
We're looking for changes
We're looking for changes
We're looking for changes in the way we are

 

[Verse 1]
I will always be hoping, hoping
You will always be holding, holding
My heart in your hand
I will understand

[Verse 2]
I will understand someday, one day
You will understand always
Always from now until then

[Pre-Chorus]
When it will be right, I don't know
What it will be like, I don't know
We live in hope of deliverance from the darkness that surrounds us

[Chorus]
Hope of deliverance, hope of deliverance
Hope of deliverance from the darkness that surrounds us

[Verse 3]
And I wouldn't mind knowing, knowing
That you wouldn't mind going
Going along with my plan

[Pre-Chorus]
When it will be right, I don't know
What it will be like, I don't know
We live in hope of deliverance from the darkness that surrounds us

[Chorus]
Hope of deliverance, hope of deliverance
Hope of deliverance from the darkness that surrounds us

[Outro]
Hope of deliverance, hope of deliverance
Hope of deliverance from the darkness that surrounds us
Hope of deliverance, hope of deliverance
Hope of deliverance from the darkness that surrounds us
Hope of deliverance, hope of deliverance, I will understand
Hope of deliverance, hope of deliverance, I will understand
Hope of deliverance
