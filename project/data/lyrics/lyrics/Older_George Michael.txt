I should have known, it seemed too easy
You were there, and I was breathing blue

Strange baby, don't you think I'm looking older?
But something good has happened to me
Change is a stranger you have yet to know

Well, you're out of time, I'm letting go, you'll be fine
Well, that much I know
You're out of time, I'm letting go
I'm not the man you want

I should have known, it seemed so easy
You were there, I thought I needed you
You

Strange baby, don't you think I'm looking older?
But something good has happened to me
Change is a stranger who never seems to show

So you're out of time, I'm letting go, you'll be fine
Or maybe you won't
You're out of time, I'm letting go
I'm not the man that you want

I never should have looked back in your direction
I know that, just the same old fights again, baby
These are wasted days without affection
I'm not that foolish anymore

So you're out of time, I'm letting go, you'll be fine
Well, that much I know
You're out of time, I'm letting go
I'm not the man that you want
