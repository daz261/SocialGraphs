[Verse]
Someone is waiting
To swallow all the halos out of you
As your face blows through my windows
Sending pieces flying all around my room
And I love you and I want to
Shoot all the super heroes from your skies
Watch them bleeding from your ceiling
As their empty anger falls out from their eyes all alone

[Instrumental]
