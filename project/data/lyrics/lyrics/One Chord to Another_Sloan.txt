There are those who live their life
As if there is no other
So they burn their bridges but they couldn't
Care any less

Comes a time that catches up
They pay no matter, pack their bags
And take off to another place to start
From scratch
They never get attached

Growing up was wall-to-wall excitement
But I don't recall another who could
Understand at all
And I didn't try to find what I just had to fall
Fall out

It's alright, I've had it up to here with everyone
And so I'll say
That there's nothing left to make me want to stay

There are those who live their life
Afraid of consequences
So they learn to sit on fences
And they can't step on toes
My heart goes out to those
They're right under my nose

Growing up was pretty dull
I often times exaggerate
The ones I hate that I
Could never save
And I realize of course
That there will come a day
That I will say

That there's nothing left to make me want to stay
But I can never go away
That there's nothing left to make me want to stay
And I will never go away
And there's nothing left to make me want to stay

 

I'm writing 'young and gifted' in my autobiography
I figure who would know better than me?
I'm certainly the former
But I'm not so much the latter
But no-one's gonna read it
So I'm sure it doesn't matter

When you find that you're the former
Take pride in how you form
And when you find that you're the latter
Don't let those people walk under you

I'm writing 'sharp and adult' with my finger on the steam
On the mirror in my bathroom
And I'm applying shaving cream
Which could suggest that I'm the foamer
But how can I be the lather?
And something tells me it's the opposite I'd rather

When you find that you're the foamer
Be careful what you foam
And when you find that you're the lather
Don't shave too high, you'll regret it later

La la la la la
La la la la la la
La laaa laaaa la la la
La la la la

I stayed in school this long but still no-one will tell me why
They figured 'who would know better than I?'
I know I'm a conformer, but I'm sure it doesn't matter
My new friends are all adults
And my old friends all have scattered

When you find that you're a conformer
Take pride and swallow whole
But if you're trying to climb the ladder
Don't let people walk over you
Because that's just what they'll do
And don't let people walk over you
Because that's just what they'll do
