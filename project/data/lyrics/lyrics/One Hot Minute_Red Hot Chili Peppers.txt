[Intro]
It started when we were little kids
Free spirits, but already tormented by our own hands
Given to us by our parents
We got together and wrote on desks
And slept in laundry rooms near snowy mountains
And slipped through whatever cracks we could find
Minds altered, we didn't falter
In portraying hysterical and tragic characters in a smog filled universe
We loved the dirty city
And the journeys away from it
We had not yet been or seen our friends, selves
Chase tails round and round in downward spirals
Leaving trail of irretrievable, vital life juice behind
Still, the brothers, blood comrades, partner, family, cousin was impenetrable
And we lived inside it, laughing with no clothes
And everything experimental until death was upon us
In our face, mortality
And lots of things seemed futile then, but love and music can save us
And did, while the giant grey monster grew
More poisoned and volatile around us
Jaws clamping down and spewing ugly shit around
Nothing is the same
So we keep moving
We keep moving

[Interlude]
(Ooh Shit! Ooh Shit!)

[Verse 1]
Went off and got some hair cuts
Looking wild and got all drugged up
Hopped a train into the night
Got a ride with a transvestite
Two boys in San Francisco
Two boys in San Francisco
Blasted off in a BART bathroom
Those coppers woke us up
The motherfuckers woke us up

[Chorus]
Two young brothers on a hovercraft
Telepathic love and belly laughs

[Verse 2]
Storm the stage of Universal
Slim shine talk boy go subversal
Papa's proud and so he sent us
Pounding hearts full and relentless
Two boys in London, England
Two boys in London, England
Climbing out of hostel windows
Wearing gear so out but in though
Come on kid and do the no, no

[Chorus]
Two young brothers on a hovercraft (yeah)
Telepathic love and belly laughs (oh yeah)

[Interlude]
(Ooh Shit! Ooh Shit!)

[Verse 3]
We went to Fairfax High School
Jumped off buildings into their pools
We'd sit down, grease at Canters
Run like hell 'cause they can't catch us
Two boys in L.A. proper
Two boys in L.A. proper
Stealing anything that we could
Got to sneak into the Starwood
Got to peak into the deep good

[Outro]
I remember
10 years ago in Hollywood
We did some good
And we did some real bad stuff
But the Butthole Surfers said
It's better to regret something you did
Than something you didn't do
Yea, we were young
And we were looking, looking
Looking for that deep kick
Yeah, seen 'em come, seen 'em go
(And I feel I'm getting close to you)
