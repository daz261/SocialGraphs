[Verse 1]
You get high, with your destructive instinct
You get high, with your corrosive instinct
Where can I go, to escape your foul mind trick?
You're trying it more, but you will never break me

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you presume the winner is you, but that's not true, so say just words to me

[Chorus]
Unreal what your hate's providing (say just words to me)
Your talk is always contradiction (say just words to me)
You won't feel the warmth of friends around you (say just words to me)
Is it true that there is worth inside, so say just words to me

[Verse 2]
Your designs, all the worse from power craving
Your desires, only where there's fire burning
I'll show you the way, a pleasure that's for the taking
You're trying it more, but you won't get satisfaction

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you presume the winner is you, but that's not true, so say just words to me

[Chorus]
Unreal what your hate's providing (say just words to me)
Your talk is always contradiction (say just words to me)
You won't feel the warmth of friends around you (say just words to me)
Is it true that there is worth inside, so say just words to me

[Interlude]

[Chorus]
Unreal what your hate's providing (say just words to me)
Your talk is always contradiction (say just words to me)
You won't feel the warmth of friends around you (say just words to me)
Is it true that there is worth inside, so say just words to me

 

Through the searching lights that weave and dart
Comes the stranger that cares not for your heart
The pain of living life this way
Must take its toll on you some day

Your jaded eyes can see
Embarrassment or harm
The frail skin that bleeds
Emotionally on guard
All lowest forms of life
Are pounding you inside
You're hollow cold display
Your tired masquerade

Let the image that you present entice
Unlike the mirror that shows the strains of vice
This act of contact your decay
While willing souls will more than pay

Your jaded eyes can see
Embarrassment or harm
The frail skin that bleeds
Emotionally on guard
All lowest forms of life
Are pounding you inside
You're hollow cold display
Your tired masquerade
