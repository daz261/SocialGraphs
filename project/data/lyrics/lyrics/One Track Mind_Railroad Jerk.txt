Left trunk, right brain
Reconciliation
This train's going to the railroad station

Bouncing on the bed springs
Tuck away the knowing
Maggie say you gotta stay
And work on the farm, well

Junkyard back bed
Yeah, that's what she said
I thought it was a twist off
I'm totally pissed off

Can I get some?
Bang the drum

Don't say you need me
When you're getting rid of me
Do you know what I know
I thought you were dense, so

Black belt, wet dream
Lower the friction
I got locked up on a rope conviction

Working in a coffee shop
I got myself knocked up
You keep on knockin'
But you can't come up

Can I get some?
Bang the drum

Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na

(My baby does the hanky panky)
(My baby does the hanky panky)

Do you know where I'm coming from?
Go ahead, bang the drum

Windshield wipers
Whether you like it or not
I gotta get away
But I don't wanna lose the spot

Don't be dumb
You're so dumb
I wish I had love
You know I wanna get some

I'll go to Philadelphia
That's where I fell for ya
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah

Can I get some?
Bang the drum

Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na

Do you know where I'm coming from?
Bang the drum
