One, two, checka how we do, ha, ha, ha
One, two (Baby)

[Verse 1]
You're hotter than a summer day in California
You got me melting like a sundae and I want ya
I know you've been waiting
You've been waiting a long time for me (For me)
But if you wait a little while longer
This is how it be

[Chorus]
Oh, it's gonna be hot like fire
I'm gonna take you, take you higher
You can't resist (When me and you)
Kiss, kiss, and kiss, and kiss, and kiss

[Verse 2]
You shouldn't rush it, take our time
I'll let you know when I'm ready if that's alright
I won't keep you, I won't keep you
I won't keep you holding on (Holding on)
But if you wait on me, I promise you it won't be long

[Chorus]
Oh, it's gonna be hot like fire (I'm gonna take you)
Take you higher (You won't, no)
You can't resist (Oh no)
Kiss, kiss, and kiss, and kiss, and kiss (I'm gonna make it)
Hot like fire (And I'm gonna take you)
Take you higher (Don't you want me?)
You can't resist (When me and you)
Kiss, kiss, and kiss, and kiss, and kiss (Baby, take your time)

[Bridge]
Take your time, don't move too fast (No, no, no)
Take your time (There's no rushing me, no, no, no)
Take your time (Woah, take your time)
Take your time (I'm gonna make it all good for you, baby)

[Chorus]
Hot like fire (I'm gonna take you)
Take you higher (No, no, no, you won't resist)
You can't resist (When I taste your lips)
Kiss, kiss, and kiss, and kiss, and kiss
Hot like fire (No, no, no, no, no)
Take you higher (No, no, no, no, no)
You can't resist (No, no, no, no, no)
Kiss, kiss, and kiss, and kiss, and kiss (No, no, no, no, no)

Love it, baby (Love it, baby, love it, baby)
Love it, baby (Love it, baby, love it, baby)

[Verse 1]
Baby, you don't know what you do to me
Between me and you, I feel a chemistry
I won't let no one come and take your place
'Cause the love you give, it can't be replaced
See no one else love me like you do
That's why I don't mind to spend my life with you
I wanna please you in anyway I can
I wanna share my world, don't you understand?

[Chorus]
Your love is a one in a million
It goes on, and on, and on
You give me a really good feelin' all day long
Your love is a one in a million
It goes on, and on, and on
You give me a really good feelin' all day long

[Verse 2]
Turn me inside out, make my heart speak
Need no one else, you're all I need
Personality and everything you do
Makes me love everything about you
Your smile, your style is so fly, I can't deny
I got a crush on you and that is true indeed
And I'm diggin' you, you make me believe

[Chorus]
That your love is a one in a million
It goes on, and on, and on
You give me a really good feelin' all day long
Your love is a one in a million
It goes on, and on, and on
You give me a really good feelin' all day long

[Bridge]
I'll give you anything you want from me
Anything you want, anything you need
Anything your soul desires, oh
I'll give you anything you want from me
Anything you want, anything you need
Anything your soul desires
Anything, 'cause

[Chorus]
Your love is a one in a million
It goes on, and on, and on
You give me a really good feelin' all day long
Your love is a one in a million
It goes on, and on, and on
You give me a really good feelin' all day long

[Chorus]
Your love is a one in a million
It goes on, and on, and on
You give me a really good feelin' all day long

You give me a really good feelin' all day long, baby
