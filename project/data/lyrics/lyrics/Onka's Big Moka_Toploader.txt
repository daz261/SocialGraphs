Goodbye to the sky
I know I can't fly but I feel love do you know
How I feel?
You are my achilles heel
Hello to below
I feel love flow like a river flow you and I
Standing still
You are my achilles heel

Feeling free yeah what about me?
Well you gotta give it up coz I feel love do you know
How I feel ?
You are my achilles heel
Goodbye to the sky
I know I can't fly but I feel love do you know
How I feel ?
You are my achilles heel

1: For there's a child in your eyes and the child never dies
To keep the dream alive
With the aid of second sight
I can push with all my might
To make a statue in the sky
Of my achilles heel

Small fry don't know why
Gotta get high just to love life
You are my highs and lows from my head to my toes
I said hey la
Will I go far?
Will I go far - cos I love life
Do you know how I feel?
You are my achilles heel
I said Oh no no
Will I go slow?
Now will I go slow?
When the feeling flows

Repeat 1

Well you're feeling free
So what about me?
I said hello and goodbye
But I don't know why
Well while we're small fry
On the line
With my achilles heel
Achilles heel etc (- to fade)
