[Verse 1]
Beauty can be sad
You're proof of that
When the damage is done
You're damaged goods

[Pre-Chorus]
That's not to say it's not okay
I wouldn't have it any other way

[Chorus]
A heart, a heart that hurts
Is a heart, a heart that works
A heart, a heart that hurts
Is a heart, a heart that works

[Verse 2]
Sweet, sweet pain comes with the sun
Lie down and soak it up
Burn off layers of insulators
Exposed
Nose to the cold

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm bleeding pretty colors
Yeah, all over myself

[Chorus]
A heart, a heart that hurts
Is a heart, a heart that works
A heart, a heart that hurts
Is a heart, a heart that works

[Verse 3]
Black wave comes to take me away
I ride it almost to the grave
Landing on a crowded shore
High-fiving

[Pre-Chorus]
What a trip, I'm better for it
I feel a live sensation

[Chorus]
A heart, a heart that hurts
Is a heart, a heart that works
A heart, a heart that hurts
Is a heart, a heart that works

[Chorus]
A heart, a heart that hurts
Is a heart, a heart that works
A heart, a heart that hurts
Is a heart, a heart that works
