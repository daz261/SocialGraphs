Lay down by my side
Let us watch the universe
Steal a little time
Take a little breath

Speed of night, speed of night

Four wings, one night
Two souls touching on one side
But both sides of the universe

I hear the moon, the witness
I hear the hand that caresses
The head of the sleeper
And as the night evanesces
The distant siren madness

Speed of night, speed of night

I hear the whale underground
Carrying people around
The city's maze
Oh whale, your journey is long
Take us to where we belong

Yes you can enter my heart
A little dance for a start
Yes you can enter my heart
But leave the door open

Speed of night, speed of night

I lay down by your side
And whisper in your ears
The few words I have learned
The few words from the wind
