This is new vengeance

I like noise
I suck art
I like romance when it's in my car
This is new vengeance

I like games
I like you
I like pressure if it hurts them too
This is new vengeance

I'll do it, I can do it
I'll take it, if I want it
I'll say it, if I feel it
I'll have it, if I need it

Sold out
No shit
Don't need approval and I don't need this
This is new vengeance

I like cars
I like fame
I like people when they call my name
This is new vengeance

I'll burn your picture
I'll burn your house down
I'll change your world then
I'll listen to reason
