With a pistol in both hands
He walked in like he had a plan
Had the eyes of a dead man
Never seen such a blood fan
Bodies twitching while ears ring
Biding time while my heart stings
Got twelve souls, sure of nothing
Wait and see what hell brings
Two tears in a bucket
The river runs red
Two tears in a bucket
Always fear for the undead
Always fear what I said

 

Do you believe
What they told you
That it's alright
Knew you'd think so
And probably give up without a fight
The disease is the cure
If you think so
I know it's real
You were threatened
But didn't know how to feel
The time is right for sacrifice
Killed the one who couldn't breathe
Killing time don't try to fight
You made the choice to believe
The race is over but you still
Want to run
Can't get over your need to
See yourself as one
Try to reason with a dead man
Plain to see
Give way for the new man
He's a lot like me
The time is right for sacrifice
Killed the one who couldn't breathe
Killing time don't try to fight
You made the choice to believe
I've been the godsend
I've been the damned fool
But I can't be
The one who guides you
