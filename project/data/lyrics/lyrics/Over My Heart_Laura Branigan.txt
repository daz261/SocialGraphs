I've been burned by love, fooled by deception
Though times have changed I still feel the pain
I would hold back my true emotions
And if someone got close I would change my direction

You walked into the picture
Right into my soul
I knew from the first night together
I never had a chance

I'm in over my heart this time
Don't know how I could be so blind
I was playin' it safe, but I made a mistake
Ignoring the danger signs
I'm in over my heart, over my heart this time

Well you told me you loved me
I got lost for a minute
Tangled in silence, nothing to say
I was in love, but I didn't know it
And the look on my face was a dead give away

Then you walked into the picture
Right into my soul
I knew from the first night together
I never had a chance

I'm in over my heart this time
And I can't get you out of my mind
It's like I'm frozen in place and I just can't run away

I'm in over my heart this time
Don't know how I could be so blind
I'm in over my heart
Over my heart this time

I'm in over my heart this time
And I can't get you out of my mind
I was playin' it safe, but I made a mistake
Ignoring the danger signs
I'm in over my heart, over my heart
Over my heart...

I'm in over my heart this time
And I can't get you out of my mind
I was playin' it safe, but I made a mistake

I'm in over my heart this time
And I can't get you out of my mind
I was playin' it safe, but I made a mistake
