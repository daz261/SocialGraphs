She was the cutest girl I'd seen
With eyes so deep and colored green
It only took a look you see
When Suzanne had put a spell on me
It made me feel so high in ecstasy
Here I go, now you just got to know
The way I feel Suzanne
The way I feel Suzanne
I knew I couldn't try to move too fast
I know this time I had to make it last
The way she made me feel had got a hold on me
It was so unreal
The way she made me feel would never pass
Here I go, now you just got to know
The way I feel Suzanne
Here I go, now you just got to know
The way I feel Suzanne
The way I feel Suzanne
You make the sun shine in the day
Why do you make me feel this way
You make me wanna fly away
Far away
Suzanne
