Gift given time, gift given time open to changes in bearing
Press covered lies, press covered hearsay, conjecture as detail
Set image plan, set image plan owing to rank in the scene

CHORUS:
Well I'll try, I guess, I'll never be affected like a bigshot
I'll never get the money that they got, and I'll be smiling much longer
And I'll try to see the one last theory on starlust, I'll dine on water and pie-crust
I'll make some sense if it kills me, and I'll be smiling on (V-Day)

Tight little line, keep weak and smile, you could be part of the dream, boys
Ten second span, ten second stay, rope in and wheel out around you
Forgotten pride, stuck making a meal out of a smile and a hairstyle

CHORUS

Gift given time, victory is mine, merit and worth, keeping still, keeping strong
Covered past, sowing rage, deaden pain, give a shit, zero one, breakdown, flatline

CHORUS
And I'll be smiling on V-Day (x3)
And I'll be smiling on...
