Twenty-four and he belives for sure he's got it made
Fame is here for good and looks will never fade
He doesn't know - the game is never over til the cards have all been played
Eighty-three and still he feels his best is yet to come
He belives that youth is wasted on the young
He's alone - the only dream he ever had was being with somone

Love you when you're standing tall, but nobody knows you when you're falling
All you have to do is call, but nobody ever hears the silent scream

Christmas came and went again but still nobody came
Starring at a wedding photo with a frame
She's alone - we should hope the lost of memory helps to ease the pain

Love you when you're standing tall, but nobody knows you when you're falling
All you have to do is call, but nobody ever hears the silent scream

Memories-moments you recall
We should be remembered for the greatest of them all
You can't begin to live someone elses' life-or your own will pass you by
Oh - who's to know
Maybe we can learn a thing or two from every one...
Love you when you're...............
