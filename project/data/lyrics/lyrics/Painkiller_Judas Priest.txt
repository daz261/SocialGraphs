[Intro]
Twisting the strangle grip
Won't give no mercy
Feeling those tendons rip
Torn up and mean

[Verse 1]
Twisting the strangle grip
Won't give no mercy
Feeling those tendons rip
Torn up and mean
Blastmaster racks the ground
Bent on survival
Full throttle hammers down
A deadly scream

[Chorus]
All guns, all guns blazing
All guns, all guns blazing

[Verse 2]
Forced into overdrive
Drawn out of anger
All talons poison dipped
Impaling spike
Heart pounding fever pitch
Blood pumping fury
Two fisted dynamo
Eager to strike

[Chorus]
All guns, all guns blazing
All guns, all guns blazing

[Guitar Solo: Glenn Tipton]

[Verse 3]
Cross cutting thundercharge
Blade of destruction
Flame throwing hurricane
Destroys the cage
Bone crushing alien
God of salvation
Sad wings that heaven sent
Wipes out in rage

[Chorus]
All guns, all guns blazing
All guns, all guns blazing
All guns, all guns blazing
All guns, all guns blazing

 

[Verse 1]
Hero of the night
Blood and thunder rushing through me
Till the dawn of light
The sky is turning red
Like a renegade
All alone I walk through fire
Till I crash and blaze
I'm living on the edge

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Start a chain reaction
Sears the neon light
Stealing all the action
Always takes the fight

[Chorus]
Leather rebel
Lightning in the dark
Leather rebel
With a burning heart

[Verse 2]
Master of the streets
Bulletproof and bound for glory
Cities at my feet
I'm turning on the power
Running wild and free
No one dares to stand before me
That's my destiny
To rule the darkest hours

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I can see my future
Writings on the wall
Legend in my lifetime
Stories will recall

[Chorus]
Leather rebel
Lightning in the dark
Leather rebel
With a burning heart

[Instrumental Break]

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I can see my future
Writings on the wall
Legend in my lifetime
Stories will recall

[Chorus]
Leather rebel
Lightning in the dark
Leather rebel
With a burning heart

[Chorus]
Leather rebel
Lightning in the dark
Leather rebel
With a burning heart

[Outro]
Leather rebel
Leather rebel
Leather rebel
Leather rebel

 

[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
Something's calling in the night
Electric madness roars in sight
Heat is rising, blazing fast
Hot and evil, feel the blast

[Pre-Chorus]
Out of control
About to explode
It's coming at you

[Chorus]
Here comes the metal meltdown
Run for your lives
Can't stop the metal meltdown
No one survives

[Verse 2]
Raging fury, wired for sound
Nitro bombshell shakes the ground
High and mighty rips the air
Piercing laser, burning glare

[Pre-Chorus]
Out of control
About to explode
It's coming at you

[Chorus]
Here comes the metal meltdown
Run for your lives
Can't stop the metal meltdown
No one survives

[Post-Chorus]
Temperature is boiling, magnifying might
Feeding like a virus, flashing light
Imminent collision, shockwaves all around
Generating energy, screams so loud

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
It's coming, meltdown
Start running, countdown

[Chorus]
Here comes the metal meltdown
Run for your lives
Can't stop the metal meltdown
No one survives

[Outro]
Metal meltdown, metal meltdown
Metal meltdown, metal meltdown
Metal meltdown, metal meltdown
Metal meltdown, metal meltdown
