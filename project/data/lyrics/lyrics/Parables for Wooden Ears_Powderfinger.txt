I'll take the lead you follow me
Come and relieve the friends that I keep
They're sick of me
Small minded creed blisters and weeps
Swallow the shit that jealousy feeds
And choke on it

And I may have a point to prove
I might just have a few enemies that I might just like to lose

I'll take the lead you follow me
Come and relieve the friends that I keep
They're sick of me
Come and relieve the friends that I keep
They're sick of me

And I may have a point to prove
I may just have a few memories that I might just like to lose

Here I stand with my tail between my legs
And I'm set to confess to these sins I didn't commit

Small minded creed blisters and weeps
Swallow the shit that jealousy feeds
And choke on it

And I may have a point to prove
And I might just have a few enemies that I might just like to lose

Here I stand with my tail between my legs
And I'm set to confess to these sins I didn't commit
No

It's all I have to say

Here I stand with my tail between my legs
And I'm set to confess to these sins I didn't commit

 

She has a hand of reasons to loose him
He liberates her often hidden smile
She buried trust faded away
He swallowed any promises they made

Darkness to weave it's silent track
Stars decorate a shroud of black
Night closed the door on a fertile mind
And captured the light that the day worked so hard to provide

Vibrant golden hues
Melt into morning's hurried bloom
Whisper the secrets from night to day

Bird announces the dawning and fills it with praise

And the wound slowly heals

Voices inferior
Voices inferior

And the wound slowly heals

Moon raise your head
From a soft horizon bead
Shine on a thirsty ground
Merciless sun steals the water for the sky to drown
