This may not last until tomorrow
So look at all the love you borrow
And time will tell us all
We could be laughing
We could be married
Tomorrow morning

And love alone won't be your saviour
And pretty soon you'll find it's over
And time has left you there
We could be singing
Could be together
Tomorrow morning

Show me only sunrise
Say you'll love me and then
Say you'll love me, oooh
Sugar rain
Tomorrow morning

And love alone won't be your saviour
And pretty soon you'll find it's over
And time has left you there
If it's not easy
It must be summer
If it's not love
Then I don't know
Tomorrow morning

Come on, girl
Hey, hey
Blue skies, water, desert, yeah
Ooh, tomorrow morning

 

What difference does it make, baby
We all make some mistakes, baby
Hold my hand I
I think I'm your

Sentimental man (Sentimental man), yeah
Sentimental man (Sentimental man)

It's not about money
It's not about love
It's not about the stars above
Only love, night and day
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Sentimental man (Sentimental man)
Sentimental man (Sentimental man)
I do the best I can
Hold me, hold me, hold me, baby yeah
Sentimental man

It's not about money
It's not about love
It's not about the stars above
Only love, night and day
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah

Sentimental man (Sentimental man)
Sentimental man (Sentimental man)

Here I come, girl
Here I come, girl, oh

Not about money
Just about love, yeah
Not about money
Just about love
Not about money
And all about love

Oh, Sentimental man (Sentimental man)
Sentimental man (Sentimental man)

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
