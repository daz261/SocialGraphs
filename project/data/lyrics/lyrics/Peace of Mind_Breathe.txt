A painted lady sings a lullaby
A raindrop falls from an empty sky
A steamboat's lying on a river bed
The captain smiles and his eyes are red

Mississippi water washing over me
Mississippi water washing over me

A lady's riding bareback on a horse
I know that Babylon must be her course
An old man's laughing at the dead of night
But I don't care if he is black or white

Mississippi water washing over me
Mississippi water washing over me

The summer heat burns the skin on my face
And the trees shimmer so in this quiet place
A bird up high sings a song that I know
And those sweet melodies fall down like snow

A crowd of people watch an empty stage
There's no performers but still they stay
Moonlight dances on a slide trombone
The captain whistles as he wanders home

Mississippi water washing over me
Mississippi water washing over me
Mississippi water washing over me
Mississippi water washing over me

Mississippi water
Mississippi water

Mississippi water washing over me
Mississippi water washing over me
Mississippi water washing over me
...

 

I see a coldness in your eyes like a winter's day
You won't accept the compromise love brings your way
Perfection you see as your prize, oh yeah

But will the circle be unbroken?

You can only learn to love when you understand
Accepting people as they are puts the key in hand
You may be looking at the stars but on earth you stand

Will the circle be unbroken?
Will the circle be unbroken?
Will it be unbroken?

Loving you is loving your imperfection
In loving me just let me see I'm your inspiration

You're driven solely by a dream that can never be
You resign yourself to search, it's your destiny
You may be looking at the stars but there's only me

Will the circle be unbroken?
Will the circle be unbroken?
Will it be unbroken?

Loving you is loving your imperfection
In loving me just let me see I'm your inspiration

Will it be, will it be, will it be unbroken?
Will it be, will it be, will it be unbroken?
Will it be, will it be, will it be unbroken?
Will it be, will it be, will it be unbroken?

Loving you is loving your imperfection
In loving me just let me see I'm your inspiration
Loving you is loving your imperfection
In loving me just let me see I'm your inspiration

Will it be, will it be, will it be unbroken?
Will it be, will it be, will it be unbroken?
Will it be, will it be, will it be unbroken?
Will the circle be unbroken?

Will it be, will it be unbroken?
Will it be, will it be, will it be unbroken?
Will it be, will it be, will it be unbroken?
Will the circle be unbroken?

Will it be, will it be, will it be unbroken?
Will it be, will it be, will it be unbroken?
