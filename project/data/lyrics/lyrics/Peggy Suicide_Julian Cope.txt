So freaked out
So humiliated
I feel outclassed
I feel overrated

Why did you & me both stand in line?
He said "I want you"
Each day we get closer to the big bad fire

I looked down at the sickness in you
Your hands reach out for my location
But you're so lost in the things you do
That you're caught in the double vegetation

Invent to conceal
All the holes in your heart
Oh, we discussed & discussed
Your disgusting routine

Why did you & me both stand in line?
He said "I want you"
Each day we get closer to the big bad fire

I looked down at the sickness in you
Your hands reaching out for my location
But you're so lost in the things you do
That you're caught in the double vegetation

 

Well it's a bruising shattering ride
But I cannot deny myself this luxury

Well it's a bruising shattering ride
But I cannot deny myself this luxury

East easy rider
Easy ride inside of you

Suspension's killing me
But I cannot deny myself this luxury

Suspension's killing me
But I cannot deny myself this luxury

East easy rider
Easy ride inside of you

Yeah, east easy rider
Easy ride inside of you

Shimmer, shimmer, shimmer
Take it on

Well it's a bruising shattering ride
But I cannot deny myself this luxury

Well it's a bruising shattering ride
But I cannot deny myself this luxury

Oh, east easy rider
Easy ride inside of you

Oh, east easy rider
Easy ride inside of you

C'mon now, east easy rider
Easy ride inside of you
You you you you

East easy rider
Easy ride inside of you
