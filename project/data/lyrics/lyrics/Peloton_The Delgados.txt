It's winning time today
You change your colors fast
And, well, you may
'Cause we're all acting coy again
Catastrophes at noon

Things change, went out of style
Maybe that's okay
Just for a while
We were acting white again
So, no one speaks, just hears

See you at your house
I know that you're a temperate old souse
And now it's like before
There's no one at the door
Cursed and out of style
I know that I am out but not by miles
And now it's like before
There's no one at the door

To see your life and lies
Will break your heart until
You must despise everything about yourself
It's a pity you's not clean

Strike the land beyond
We started off on bikes
Came home by car
And at the junction we revealed
That we believed in you

See you at your house
I know that you're a temperate old souse
And now it's like before
There's no one at the door
Cursed and out of style
I now that I am out but not by miles
And now it's like before
There's no one at the door

 

This is not my house
But I know you both so well
Feels like it could be
But I can hear the bell

Dave's with his soulmate
Clothing for the course
Dines on a cloth plate
He wonders if she scores

Why did you buy this?
I know you dressed in red
Hardly surprising
The bed before you wed

If I forget what I saw
This time I'll find you
See the sign on the wall
Pray it won't kill you
Book a room, book it soon
Before I find you
Move aside as they slide
Leave it to those who know best

It looks so real
But I think it's just too tall
Let me try it
I'll stand here in the hall

And I know that ice can't burn
But I can see the flames
Melting the blocks in turn
Before I name some names

If I forget what I saw
This time I'll find you
See the sign on the wall
Pray it won't kill you
Book a room, book it soon
Before I find you
Move aside as they slide
Leave it to those who know best

Climb the stile and relax here for awhile
Taking stock of the job you have ahead
You will find what's behind all the actions of this kind
Be it all that they're happening in my head

There's this guy who speaks and I know he knows I'm weak
Fine possessions by my side. I can't carry them; I'm fried
Oh, before I go, there's some gratitude to show
For the car, hear me out, was a star

These lights, they are hurting
And these games of names of old
Don't go confusing
The console with the board

Now I see a train station
The name I see is gray
Show me the exit now
So I can get away

If I forget what I saw
This time I'll find you
See the sign on the wall
Pray it won't kill you
Book a room, book it soon
Before I find you
Move aside as they slide
Leave it to those who know best
