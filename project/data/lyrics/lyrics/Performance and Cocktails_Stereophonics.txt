When you think about it
He's watching every word you say, yeah
Say yeah
And when he's sussed you out
He calls her up and out she comes and hustles
Us
Long digging
Gone fishing
Love drinking

The bartender and the thief are lovers
Steal what they need like sisters and brothers
Met in a church a night to remember
Robbing the graves of bodies dismembered

He watched the lesbian talk
She kissed and groped but mostly talked in lust
Crushed
He couldn't make the call
His eyes were gripped on licking tongues
Enough's enough
Failed for once

Long digging
Gone fishing
Love drinking

The bartender and the thief are lovers
Steal what they need like sisters and brothers
Met in a church a night to remember
Robbing the graves of bodies dismembered

Long digging
Gone fishing
Love drinking

The bartender and the thief are lovers
Steal what they need like sisters and brothers
Met in a church a night to remember
Robbing the graves of bodies dismembered

Saved what they stole to meet at the altar
Place where they first set eyes on each other
Flew to the sun to start life all over
Set up a bar and robbed all the locals

Dooooo doooooo doooo doooo doo dooooo doooo dooooo dooo
