A life to call our own
That is ours alone
Is as hard as hell to come by these days
Time that I took what's mine, took it now
Things aren't what they where, they're what they are
There's no time of our own
And the devil you know is the only one
Is time too fast for us to grasp something of our own?
The ghost of the past has its arms around me
It moves everywhere in all I hear and see
And the devil you know is the only one
Look at you now, look at you then, see how you will be
All of your life belongs to me
Things aren't what they where, they're what they are
There's no time of our own
And the devil you know is the only one
