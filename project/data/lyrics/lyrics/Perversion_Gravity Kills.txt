If you could see me now
I'd give to you what you have stolen
If you could see me now
If you could be me
If you could see me - now

Why are the faces hiding?
The shadows always seem so cold
Be careful what you're finding
You feel so old

If you think I cry for you
It is only 'cause you ask me to
And it all becomes so clear
You're the one you fear

If you could see me now
I tear apart what is unbroken
If you could see me now
Everything that is unspoken
If you could see me now

You're watered down and empty
Pretending all is clear
So watered down and empty
You're the one you fear

If you could see me now
I tear apart what is unbroken
If you could see me now
Everything that is unspoken
If you could see me now

I hear your stomach turning
You think that I am such a whore
And the flesh I'm giving
You want more

Like a soul kept on your shelf
But you keep it there for someone else
And it all becomes so clear
You're the one you fear

If you could see me now
If you could see me now
If you could see me now
If you could be me
If you could see me

If you could see me now
I tear apart what is unbroken
If you could see me now
Everything that is unspoken
If you could see me now
Now...
