Untie the hands that bind your mind
And be nice
She puts a gun against her ear
Inside against a gin and tonic sky
She's a star; she finds a place to lose her pain

Caged as she waits inside
Hate and she wants to die
And she wants
And she wants to live

Deny The problem never catches light
And rewind She pours herself some self respect

Caged as she waits inside
Hate and she wants to die
And she wants
And she wants to live
Away back from this haze

Still she's caged as she waits inside
Hate and she wants to die
Get me back from this haze
Get me back from this haze
Get me back from this haze
