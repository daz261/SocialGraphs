Your imagination's having puppies
It could be a video for new recruits
Just stare into the camera
And pretend that you've got the flu
Or dreams of impossible vacations
And get all teary from the wind
Look as though you're standing at the station
Long after the train came in

And see how the space tautens
Like there's something on
And you're never more hot then
When you've got something on

Picture a century of water
Bury the pipeline guy right here
Kill the dream of possible vacations
With the sweep of a mapping pioneer
Outside there's hectic action
The ice is covering the trees
And one of them is interconnecting
With my Chevrolet Caprice

Black out to phantom power
And like there's nothing on
And hammering the tower
And now there's nothing on

We'll ride the monorail
Rocking gently home on the trail
You want to show me the moon

I know you're standing at the station
I know there's nothing on
I know that alienation
I know the train's long gone

I can see how your face tautens
Like you've got something on
It makes me feel just rotten
But you've got something on

 

The man 'cross the street he don't move a muscle
Though he's all covered in dust
When constitutions of granite can't save the planet
What's to become of us?

With a painted restraint I don't move a muscle
Though a turbine roars
If the bathwater's clear and my ear's underwater
It's a tolerant hum from the core

Sleep's beckoning from the depths
From the cracks and from the crevices
Join the army of ghosts, the murmurs in the mist

That's when the powers of observation
Come to the periphery town
And we'd carry their water
We don't make a sound

And after gaining our resignation
They come through the chain link fence
Your only enemy's panic
Your only chance is to start making sense

Sleep plunging into deeper debt
Inter bunkers and black minarets
On a geyser of ink, a morning voice faint and yet

And it sounds heroincredible
Sound that makes the headphones edible
Awake, affiliated and indelible

The man 'cross the street don't move a muscle
Though he's all covered in dust
Says constitutions of granite can't save the planet
What's left to captivate us? (What's to become of us?)
What's left to captivate us? (What's to become of us?)
What's left to captivate us? (What's to become of us?)

What's to become of us?
