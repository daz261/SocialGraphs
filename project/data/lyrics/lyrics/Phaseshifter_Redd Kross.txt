You look so fine
But are you too old too be the first in line
Die hard dedication
Would you give me a standing ovation

So bad you stand in her place
You better go now
Oooh you better look out
The lady in the front row

Someone took your spot
But nobody's gonna knock you off
Jealous thieves
It's invisible the power you keep

So bad you stand in her place
You better go now
Oooh you better look out
The lady in the front row

I know your face but what's your race
Are you a homosapien from space
A barometer of the mob reaction
Simple love everything we know as action

So bad you stand in her place
You better go now
Oooh you better look out

It's show time
It's show time
It's show time
It's show time
It's show time

 

Rotten world black to the core
Do you want another war
Something big, something more?
Lightning God lives in the sky
Are you not like other guys
Sheets of rain and light that blinds

Sometimes, sometimes, all I want is the sunshine
Sometimes, sometimes, all I want is

All I need is the ground at my feet and to love you
All I need is the warmth on my face
And it's you that makes me feel this way

Little girl what do you want
Is it something that I've got
Maybe yes or maybe not
Hands that reach to touch the sea
A man in love is hard to be
The price you pay is never free

Sometimes, sometimes, all I want is the sunshine
Sometimes, sometimes, all I need is

All I need is the ground at my feet and to love you
All I need is the warmth on my face
And it's you that makes me feel this way

Just give me a kiss
On top of the monolith
Don't hide away because
The light today is stars in flames

Sometimes, sometimes, all I want is the sunshine
Sometimes, sometimes, all I need is
Sometimes, sometimes, all I want is the sunshine
Sometimes, sometimes, all I need is
Sometimes, sometimes, all I want is the sunshine
Sometimes, sometimes, all I want is
Sometimes, sometimes, all I need is
Sometimes, sometimes, all I want is
