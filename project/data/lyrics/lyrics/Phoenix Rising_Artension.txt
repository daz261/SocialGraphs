Packed their bags and left that day one way ticket to outer space
Mohtership has sailed away blinded by the comets fall

Faithfully they follow, into the fire they ride
Fearless hope by their side if only they knew the stories he told were untrue

Through the gate it's too late cast their lives into the lake of fate
No one told them it all was a lie (he said) take my hand and together we'll fly
Senseless tragedy if only they'd wait, it's too late through the gate

Coins of silver for toils to pay, made the potion and drank their lives away
Mothership did not come through, blinded by the comet Hale

Don't be fooled by men who say"my new religion is the only way"
Mother's love is there for you put your faith in what is real

Faithfully they follow, into the fire they ride
Fearless hope by their side if only they knew the stories he told were untrue

Through the gate it's too late cast their lives into the lake of fate
No one told them it all was a lie (he said) take my hand and together we'll fly
Senseless tragedy if only they'd wait, it's too late through the gate

Faithfully they follow, into the fire they ride
Fearless hope by their side if only they knew the stories he told were untrue

Through the gate it's too late cast their lives into the lake of fate
No one told them it all was a lie (he said) take my hand and together we'll fly
Senseless tragedy if only they'd wait, it's too late through the gate

 

Desert sand, Modern man searching for answers to the mysteries
Far away night become day unlock the secrets of their lives

And through the years nature's tears wash away the pain with the rain
After all this time, oh victim of the crime
They fear a kill, a kill in the afterlife

Cross the sea to the Valley Of The Kings
Men are fools never know what the future brings
Gold and thieves in the Valley Of The Kings
Look what you've done, oh the damage is done

Forever sleep their souls to keep entombed in dark shadows for all time
Shifting sand the hands of man disturbing the peace of sacred land
And through the years nature's tears wash away the pain with the rain
They left a curse for you nothing you can do
They fear a kill, a kill in the afterlife

Cross the sea to the Valley Of The Kings
Men are fools never know what the future brings
Gold and thieves in the Valley Of The Kings
Look what you've done, oh the damage is done
They fear a kill, a kill in the afterlife

Cross the sea to the Valley Of The Kings
Men are fools never know what the future brings
Gold and thieves in the Valley Of The Kings
Look what you've done, oh the damage is done
