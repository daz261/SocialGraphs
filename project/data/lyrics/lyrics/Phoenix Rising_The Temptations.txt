[Intro]
Ooh ooh, mmm, mmm, yeah, hey, oh no
Na, na, na, na, na, na, yeah, ah ah, yeah yeah

[Verse 1]
Just to feel your body, your sensual design
You know my heart goes crazy when your tender lips touch mine
Let's explore our love under candlelight and wine
We'll leave the world behind, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
(Girl, do you believe) In the miracle of love
(Won't you try and see) I'm the one you're dreamin' of
(Baby, close your eyes) Let the fantasy become real
Oh, yeah (Will I)

[Chorus]
Stay 'til the mornin', baby, rock me, girl
Like I wanna rock you (Like I wanna rock you)

Stay 'til the mornin', baby, let me know
That you want me too (I wanna rock you, baby)
(I wanna rock you, baby)

[Verse 2]
Can you feel me, baby, 'cause I'm comin' from the heart
You're such a sexy lady, ooh, just tell me where to start
I'll make sweet, sweet love like you never felt before
And give you so much more, hey, hey

(When you need a friend) I will come to you
(You just tell me when) Girl, that's all you got to do
(Let me be your man) I will be your pleasure
(Anytime) Anytime, anytime you need

Stay 'til the mornin', baby, rock me, girl
Like I wanna rock you

[Bridge]
I'll sing it from the highest mountain (The highest mountain)
Paint the words across the sky (All across the sky)
(Ooh...ooh...ooh...)

I can love you through the day and all night, and all night, and all night
Of all the riches in the world, you will forever be my girl (I wanna know)

(Baby, forever)
(Oh, oh, why don't you stay)
Stay (I love, I love everything about you)
With me, ooh, ooh

 

[Verse 1]
First you say that you want me
Make me quiver with desire
Acting like, you needed me, had my body on fire
But every minute was a night of show
Nothing really matters anymore
Am I dreaming? Is this a mirage?
I never played this game before, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Told me you'd love me forever
I guess I just wasn't clever
Enough to realize the look in you eyes
That you're wearing a disguise

[Chorus]
With your false faces
I just can't get with that (False Faces)
Strange places
Why you wanna take me there> (False Faces)

[Verse 2]
I tried so hard to get close to you
To tell you what's on my mind
I reach out my hand for you
But you were gone every time
I never played this game before
It's like a schizophrenic magic show, yeah
Am I dreaming? Is this a mirage?
I never played this game before, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Told me you'd love me forever
I guess I just wasn't clever
Enough to realize the look in you eyes
That you're wearing a disguise
Acting like a chameleon, changing right before my eyes
You say one thing but mean another
Tell me what you're trying to hide under your

[Chorus]
False faces
I just can't get with that (False Faces)
Strange places
Why you wanna take me there? (False Faces)
(False faces)
I just can't get with that (False Faces)
Strange places
I don't want to go there no more (False faces)

False faces (I'm talkin' 'bout) (False faces)
I just can't get with that (False Faces)
Strange places
Why you wanna take me there? (False Faces)

[Pre-Chorus]
Told me you'd love me forever
I guess I just wasn't clever
Enough to realize the look in you eyes
That you're wearing a disguise
Acting like a chameleon, changing right before my eyes
You say one thing but mean another
Tell me what you're trying to hide under your

[Outro]
False faces
I just can't get with that (False Faces)
Strange places
Why you wanna take me there? (False Faces)
(False faces)
I just can't get with that (False Faces)
Strange places
Why you wanna take me there? (False Faces)
