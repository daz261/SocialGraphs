We like to spy on the neighbors
They look so happy together
Funny the power of strangers
Sometimes I wonder if they got it better
Green. Have you seen green?
Check out the view from the rooftop
They've got a horse and a big trampoline
Running and jumping till they drop
Down on the ground and they're rolling around in... green
Have you seen green?
Have you seen green grass?
So green... grass
So green
I'd like to be like that
I'd like to be like that
I'd like to be moving on a lawn... so green
I want to laugh the way they laugh
See all my blues get back up in the sky
If only we had what they had
We'd never worry and we'd never cry for... green
Have you seen green?
Have you seen grass?
So green... grass
So green
I'd like to be like that
I'd like to be like that
I'd like to be moving on a lawn... so green
