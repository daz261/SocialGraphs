It's been a year since I last saw Mary
When she said goodbye
She casts a spell on my intention
Ooh that's the reason why
I'm taking my thoughts from a bottle lately
And breaking them up in my mind
And all my thoughts, they don't look pretty
Ooh to my surprise

It's so hard to take what you're given
And it's so hard to give what you've got

After the love goes here I go
There's no easy road

Well the bright lights of Memphis
Sounds like a real good time
But I lost my heart
And the money flowed like cherry wine
So I don't remember the church bells ringing
Through the day or the night
But I kept my soul on my own
Not without a fight

It's so hard to take what you're given
And it's so hard to give what you've got

After the love goes here I go
There's no easy road

It's been a while since I last saw Mary
Wipe a tearful eye
Well I remember I first heard Mary
Say her last goodbye
Breaking it up in my bottle lately
And making it up in my mind
And all my problems they don't look pretty
Ooh, that's the bottom line

It's so hard to take what you're given
And it's so hard to give what you've got

After the love goes here I go
There's no easy road

 

If you're there and you care
And you listen very careful, darling
You'll hear my prayer

And if you hear, loud and clear
You will get a million kisses from me
Somewhere, somehow

And if the night's a lonely time for you
Just listen to the words I gave to you
Uh huh
Let the song of ours play one more time
Somewhere, somehow
I'll be there

Went out walkin' in the mornin'
Standin' in the pourin' rain
Oh, let it run over me

Ohhhhhhh
Stayed up way late last night
Tryin' to put all things right oh hoo hoo
Oh, let the tears roll over me

And if the night's a lonely time for you
Just listen to the words I gave to you
Let the song of ours play one more time
Somewhere, somehow
I'll be there

Hey
Hey hey hey
Hey hey hey

If you're there, and you care
You'll get a million kisses from me
Somewhere, somehow

And if you feel like I feel
Love cuts the deepest part of me
Somewhere, somehow

And if the night's a lonely time for you
Just listen to the words I gave to you
Let the song of ours play one more time
Somewhere, somehow
I'll be there
