[Refrain: Pilar Basso]
Hey, hey, hey, woman, it’s alright
Hey, hey, hey, woman, it’s alright

[Verse 1: Moby]
In my dreams I'm dying all the time
Then I wake, it's kaleidoscopic mind
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to lie
So this is goodbye?
This is goodbye...

[Refrain: Pilar Basso]
Hey, hey, hey, woman, it’s alright
Hey, hey, hey, woman, it’s alright

[Bridge: Moby and (Pilar Basso)]
Tell the truth, you've never wanted me (Hey, hey)
(Hey, woman, it’s alright) Tell me

[Verse 2: Moby]
In my dreams I'm jealous all the time
When I wake I'm going out of my mind
Going out of my mind

[Refrain: Pilar Basso]
Hey, hey, hey, woman, it’s alright
Hey, hey, hey, woman, it’s alright
Hey, hey, hey, woman, it’s alright
Hey, hey, hey, woman, it’s alright
