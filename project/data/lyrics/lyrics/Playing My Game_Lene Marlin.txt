[Verse 1]
Won't open my mouth
You know what I'll say
It hurts me that it's gotta be this way
I can no longer hide
God knows I've tried
I held on as long as I could
If I could change it I would
This is the way I am
And this is what I do

[Chorus]
I cry my tears
But they're not for you
Playing a game
I know you've done too
I shouldn't have waited
But still it is all the same
'Cause you know
I'm just playing my game

[Verse 2]
Close your ears if you don't like
The sound of my voice
You're acting like I
Like I had a choice
But to leave you behind
Well, I've made up my mind

[Chorus]
I cry my tears
But they're not for you
Playing a game
I know you've done too
I shouldn't have waited
But still it is all the same
'Cause you know
I'm just playing my game

Don't hold me with your eyes
The light in them I cannot see
No need to blind me
There's this darkness where I walk
You thought you had your future
All figured out

I cry...

[Chorus]
I cry my tears
But they're not for you
Playing a game
I know you've done too
I shouldn't have waited
But still it is all the same
'Cause you know
I'm just playing my game
I'm playing my game
