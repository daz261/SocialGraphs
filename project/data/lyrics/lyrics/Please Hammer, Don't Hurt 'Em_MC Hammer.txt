Yes, this is a mission, that I'm on
Takin out the weak on the microphone

About the hard hittin Hammer, when you can't even walk
On the STAGE -- after me
And if you do, yo, a catastrophe
Happens -- just like that

"Naw, NAW!" -- is what I said
When I came to see a show
I looked and it was dead, DEAD!! -- y'know!
Like a body in the ground, will your show ever grow?
Let me know -- if not
Then close yo' mouth because you sho' ain't hot
It needs WORK! -- like a car in a wreck
They call me Hammer, you gotta earn my respect
OH, OH, OH - Yeah!

Before the bell rings, I'm out the gate
And rollin, out for mine
Workin so hard for such a long time
In life, it's here and gone
So (PEDAL TO THE HAMMER) while I'm watchin the throne
Not a king, just feelin hype
You dance to the music while I'm on the mic

Your ego so big, that you missed the whole train

[Chorus]
That's word, we pray (Pray, pray)
We got to pray just to make it today
I said we pray (Pray)
Oh yeah we pray (Pray)
We got to pray just to make it today
That's word, we pray

[Verse 1]
All my life I wanted to make it to the top
(That's word, we pray)
Some said I wouldn't, they told me no, but I didn't stop
(That's word, we pray)
Working hard, making those moves everyday
(That's word, we pray)
And on my knees, every night you know I pray

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Now I just think that you can do whatever you want
(That's word, we pray)
I'm busting these rhymes making this money and I won't
(That's word, we pray)
Forget my people or my town or my ways
(That's word, we pray)
And on my knees every night I'm still gone pray

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Time and time and time and time and time again
(That's word, we pray)
I kept on knocking, but these people wouldn't let me in
(That's word, we pray)
I tried and tried and tried and tried to make a way
(That's word, we pray)
But nothing happened 'til that day I prayed

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
Children dying, oh so fast from this and that
(That's word, we pray)
Need that money, working that dope, smoking that crack
(That's word, we pray)
Ten years old, stand outside, better look out
(That's word, we pray)
Dead and gone, never had a chance, what's it all about?

[Alternate Chorus]
That's word, we pray (Pray, pray)
We need to pray just to make it today
I said we pray (Pray)
Oh yeah we pray (Pray)
We need to pray just to make it today
That's word, we pray

That's word, we pray (3x)

[Alternate Chorus]

[Verse 5]
On a mission start to doubt, here we go
(That's word, we pray)
Kicking back, read these words we need to know
(That's word, we pray)
Living high, living good, living long
(That's word, we pray)
Take a minute, bust a prayer and you good to go

[Alternate Chorus]

[Outro]
We're sending this one out to the Lord
And we thank you and we know we need to pray
Cause all the blessings that are good
They come from above
And once again we want to say "thank you" to the Lord
With all our love
We outta here
That's word, we pray

That's word, we pray (pray, pray) (4x)

 

[Chorus]
Crime stories
You get, boy, no glory
Not in these crime stories
I'm tellin' you right now, no glory
Scene I

Too Big and the Hammer rollin' on a hit
Knives in our hands to the sound of the click
And now we're ready, we hit the swoove
Windows ease down we spray their crews

Eight fools dead, a baby too
You ask me how I'm livin', this hit's for you
But that's not all we got the prize
A mother in a kitchen, now yo, she's dead inside

Yeah, we took them suckers out
They know what time it is now

[Chorus]
Scene II, me and Too Big at the club

Too Big and the Hammer kickin' it at the club
Boastin' about the way that we pulled those sucker's plugs
We weren't worried, naw, we didn't care
When you're in this war, yo, all is fair

A tap on my shoulder, I turn around
Too Big is dyin' fast, he's on the ground
I reach for my gat, it was too late
The knives went pointblank range in my face

Yo, they opened fire and took me out
Somebody tell my mother, I love her, man

[Chorus]
Scene III, the pimpin' game

Now I'm pimpin' these berries, got to get that money
Those suckers still payin' for a little bit of honey
Nothin' in this world can stop my flow
AIDS ain't done nothin' but help my business grow

My babes are trained to make that dollar
To take you out, fool, it ain't no bother
You dropped your pants and you pay the price
Your money maybe AIDS, fool, and then your life

Yeah, that's right cause a pimp got to make it
You know what I'm sayin'

We're talkin' about crime stories
And I ain't givin' up no propers, no glory

[Chorus]
Scene IV, the pimp got took out by Barry's brother

We got this tip on some new fresh bait
Money in their heads and they could hardly wait
My girls went to their room to make the play
Two suckers at once, yeah, would make my day

Now I'm outside some suckers walk up
Talkin' real hard about smokin' my butt
He pushed the button, the blade came out
Cut me on my throat and then a bullet in my mouth

I guess the devil got all the babes in hell
Maybe he'll let me work with him? Ssh

[Chorus]
And I'd like to say this before we get outta here

To my brothers in the game, my brothers
Who are out there doin' what they feel they've got to do
I wanna ask you one favor, let's let the young kids 10, 11, 12 years old
Let's let them go on and do their thing at the schoolhouse

Let's give them a chance to make it
Let's give them a chance at a different life
You doin' what you feel you have to do
But they youngsters and they don't know any better

So we want to give them a chance to live
I mean life is precious, and you know that yourself
And you try to make a better life for yourself

So what I'm sayin' this from the bottom of my heart, let the kids be
Help the children lead to another way
And peace from you and I love you and I'm outta here
