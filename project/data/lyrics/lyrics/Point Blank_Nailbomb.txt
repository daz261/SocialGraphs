Trapped on the inside, you stare in
Who the fuck are you to tell us anything
Rotting right through, poison inside
Thirty-one flavours of napalm to try

Fuck you and your plans
I live my life my way
Vai toma no cú
You scumbag, you waste

Tired of your ways, hate rising again
I know you'd like to see me put a bullet in my brain
I'm not gonna be part of your plan
Fuck your solutions, 'cause nothing gets changed

Fuck you and your plans
I live my life my way
Vai toma no cú
You scumbag, you waste

Fuck you and your plans
I live my life my way
Vai toma no cú
You scumbag, you waste

Fuck you and your plans
I live my life my way
Vai toma no cú
You scumbag, you waste

Fuck you and your plans
Vai toma no cú...
