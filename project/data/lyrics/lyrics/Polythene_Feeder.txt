It's funny how I watch the day go by
I'm sitting watching TV talk shows high
There's banging on the walls
My head aches
I'm drinking out the world that I hate

I had a big car, new clothes, everything
I've had a watch engraved in Switzerland
Today I saw her buying a magazine
It's time to get myself some therapy
How can I stop this, how can I stop this disease?

She's got a new dress on
(I'm in cement)
Sits by her radio
(I'm in cement)
She's got those x-ray eyes
(I'm in cement)
Don't know which way to go

It's funny but i dream of yesterday
I'm blistered by the burns that life has made
I'm staring out behind the window shade
See her face across the street again

I'm in quick sand sinking in again
I've got conrete shoes and I can't swim
How can I stop this, how can I stop this disease?

She's got a new dress on
(I'm in cement)
Sits by her radio
(I'm in cement)
She's got those x-ray eyes
(I'm in cement)
Don't know which way to go

She's got a new dress on
She's got a new dress on

I don't know what to do, but I know that I must pull thru
I can't keep watching you
How can I stop this, how can I stop this disease?
