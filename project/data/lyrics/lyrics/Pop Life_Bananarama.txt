Angel divine
With you by my side
I can do anything I want to
I'll sacrifice
For you I'd lay down my life
'Cause I was alone without you

We all need somebody
You know I need somebody
No one has to feel alone
We all need some love
You know I need your love
To break these chains around my soul

Only your love
Can free me
Only your love
Can ease me
Only your love
I need it
Only your love
Never let me go
Let me go
Never let me go
Let me go
Never let me go
Let me go
Never let me go
Let me go

Heat of the flame
That burns in your name
Got to got to got to believe it
Angel of love
Descend from above
Come on and shine your light on me

We all need somebody
You know I need somebody
No one has to feel alone
We all need some love
You know I need your love
To break these chains around my soul

Only your love
Can free me
Only your love
Can ease me
Only your love
I need it
Only your love
Never let me go
Let me go
Never let me go
Let me go
Never let me go
Let me go
Never let me go
Let me go

We all need somebody
You know I need somebody
No one has to feel alone
We all need some love
You know I need your love
To break these chains around my soul

Only your love
Can free me
Only your love
Can ease me
Only your love
I need it
Only your love
Never let me go
Let me go
Never let me go
Let me go
Never let me go
Let me go
Never let me go
Let me go
