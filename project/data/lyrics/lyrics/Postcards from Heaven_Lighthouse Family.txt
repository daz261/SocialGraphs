Wishing we could choose our own landscape
Wishing me and you could just go anywhere we wanted
Once in a blue moon we'd stay out late
And watch the sun come up at five-thirty in the morning

Oh yeah, once in a blue moon

Day will surely come, one day I'll be with you
The day will surely come, we will make it all come true
The day will surely come

I ain't seen you, in a month of Sundays
I never knew exactly what it was I wanted
Once in a blue moon, you'd keep a promise
When it's you I don't mind such a long wait

Oh no, not when it's you

Day will surely come, one day I'll be with you
The day will surely come, we will make it all come true
The day will surely come

The day will surely come
The day will surely come
The day will surely come

Day will surely come, one day I'll be with you
The day will surely come, we will make it all come true
Day will surely come, one day I'll be with you
The day will surely come, we will make it all come true
