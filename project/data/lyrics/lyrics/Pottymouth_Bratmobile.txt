Old folks say, ya poor little fool
Down the street I'm the girl next door
I'm the fox you've been waiting for

Hello Daddy, hello Mom

Hello world I'm your wild girl

Stone age love and strange sounds too
Come on baby let me get to you
Bad nights causin' teenage blues
Get down ladies you've got nothing to lose

Hello Daddy, hello Mom
I'm your ch ch ch ch ch cherry bomb
Hello world I'm your wild girl
I'm your ch ch ch ch ch cherry bomb

Hello Daddy, hello Mom

Hello world I'm your wild girl

Hey straight girl what's your style
Your daddy's dreams don't make you smile
I'll give ya something to live for
Have you, grab you 'til you're sore

Hello Daddy, hello Mom
I'm your ch ch ch ch ch cherry bomb
Hello world I'm your wild girl
I'm your ch ch ch ch ch cherry bomb
