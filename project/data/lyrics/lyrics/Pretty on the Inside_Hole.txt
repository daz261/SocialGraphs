[Verse 1]
Here you come, sucking my energy
And you suck it up right off the street, huh?
Babydoll

Here you are, sucking my energy right up
Drill it in my good hole so that I can see
You are, you are so much bigger than me
You are, you are so much bigger than me, uh-huh
Babydoll

[Chorus]
My raw hand, my fever blister
Watch me, watch me, watch me disappear
Here, h-h-here, here she comes, her pants undone
All waste and void, all waste and void, and void, and void
Wow!

There you go in your Nazi car
Oh babydoll, what a whore you are
And you sit around with your old rag
How can I, how can I talk when you, you've got the gag?

[Verse 2]
Here you come, sucking my energy
And you suck it up, baby, right off the street, uh-huh
Babydoll

In the dark I, I destroy what
What I became, what I destroy, yeah
She's hanging in the blossom tree
Babydoll just bleeds for me, wow!
Babydoll

[Chorus]
Babydoll, she's on the field
Her chemical wedding, her chemical peel
I knife me, and I slash mine
And I knife me, and I slash mine

Sick and sorry me, well
Here you are, as ugly as me, oh
Drill it in my good hole so that I can see, yeah
Drill it in my good hole so that I can see, yeah

[Verse 3]
Here you come, sucking my energy
And you suck it up, baby, right off the street
Babydoll

She stares too long into the sun
Now I, I want a cancer that the crooked eye spun, well, you
You don't mind my energy, 'cause baby
You are so much bigger than me - wow!
Babydoll

[Chorus]
Little girl, she's on the floor
She gets it all 'cause she's the whore
Little girl, she's on the ground
She gets it all for falling, falling down
Falling down
Wow!

[Outro]
"I am, I am," she says
"I am not free," she says
"Help me, I am withering
Withering, withering, withering"
Hang on, you'll get your soul
It's a soul
Hey, it's a soul, it comes down
See, see it's a soul

 

[Verse 1]
She tears the hole up even wider
Lets all the darkness up inside her
Holy old, yeah, hey, you're mine
Your everything is mine

[Pre-Chorus]
Without, without a doubt
Without, without a doubt

[Chorus]
Hey, where the fuck were you
When my lights went out?
Yeah, you don't want to look at it now
Yeah, you don't want to look at it
Wow!

[Pre-Chorus]
Without, without a doubt
Come on and let me out

[Chorus]
Hey, where the fuck were you
When my lights went out?
Yeah, you don't want to look at it now
Yeah, you don't want to look at me

[Outro]
Come on and let me out
Come on and let me out
Yeah, tie a soul to you when your life goes down
Time flies when you're falling down
I spread my rot all over this town
And every one of you looks the same
And every one of you feels the same
