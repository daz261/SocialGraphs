[Intro]
And bass up the track a little bit
'Cause I wanna hear that "boompsh, boompsh"
You know I'm sayin'?
Ahhh!

[Verse 1]
Now who got the flav' that comes a dime a dozen that keeps ‘em buzzin’
Thinking that they fat when they wasn't
Welcome to the world of Mack, or Mackman
Leave you small guys sayin', I eat MC's like Pac-Man
I'm incredible, better eats ya vegetables
'Cause, I does what I do you (Do it!)
I fake the roof off of soft suckers
Super smackin', mackin', full effect mike check one two
I'ma reign, reign forever
Rain like bad weather, reign like whoever, never
You can't bite my style
'Cause my style ain't a style that is a style so I can go buckwild
Bet you figured you got more funk for flow, it ain't so
Flava in Ya Ear letcha know
Now I'm about a second from the hook, dook
Scrap ya rap book, 'fore you get ya wet style shook

[Hook]
Can I get down?
Get on down, can I get down?
Can I get down?
Get on down, can I get down?
Can I get down?
Get on down, can I get down?
Can I get down?
Get on down, can I get down?

[Verse 2]
The Mack's like a superintendent
Burning MC's leaves a foul scent
See, I'm like what ya call, king of yes ya'll
My style's rick, sick, I mean real sick
Shit's thick, I come with the ammo
The real whammo-slammo stuff that I be droppin'
And I'll wake the great, let's warm up the hot plate
I'm changing fate from the neck I'ma castrate
My rap loves to alienate
Shake ya ass to 'til it stank, you stomp, I dominate
See, I ain't scared of you mothafuckas
To me ya all suckers 'cause I make the ruckus
Don't try to buck us, we roll bulletproof
No cooth, on the roof, bitin' like a sabertooth
I pound on the ground when I get down
So let me get down, let me get down

[Hook]
Can I get down?
Get on down, can I get down?
Can I get down?
Get on down, can I get down?
Can I get down?
Get on down, can I get down?
Can I get down?
Get on down, can I get down?

[Verse 3]
Can leap a tall building, crush the Earth for fun
But I'm sayin' ain't no fair, yo, when MC's run (Ain't no fair, ain't no fair)
The mic's now in the right hands
'Cause the Mack’s on the Earth just to spoil your plans
More pep than the pepper that's in ya pepper shaker
Ruff earthquaker, couldn't take me if ya mama make ya
I back up the funk that I bring with unknown to man slang
With bigger bite than the Devil fang
I ain't met who could hang, if ya testin' in ya lesson
Got me dressin' for ya funeral session
Man, it won't even matter no more
Craig in '94 just won the war
My style was definite to take ya over
Have ya sittin' lookin' over in a four door Chevy Nova (Why I oughta)
I figure its a slaughter
In the world of dollars, ya shit ain't nothing but a quarter
The name of the track is "Get Down"
So let me get down and pound other MC's in the ground

[Hook]
Can I get down?
Get on down, can I get down?
Can I get down?
Get on down, can I get down?
Can I get down?
Get on down, can I get down?
Can I get down?
Get on down, can I get down?

[Outro]
Get down, boy (Down, down)
Can I get down? (Hah)
Can I get down? (Down, down)
Can I get down?

 

[Intro: Diddy]
Changed my mind man..

[Chorus: Diddy]
Gotta get the cash, gotta get the dough
Gotta keep my flow
Gotta get the cash, gotta get the dough
Gotta keep my flow
Gotta get the cash, gotta get the dough
Gotta keep my flow
Gotta get the cash, gotta get the dough (Y'know?)
Gotta keep my flow
Gotta get the cash, gotta get the dough
Gotta keep my flow
Gotta get the cash, gotta get the dough
Gotta keep my flow
Gotta get the cash, gotta get the dough
Gotta keep my flow
Gotta get the cash, gotta get the dough
Gotta keep my flow
Gotta get the cash, gotta get the dough
Gotta keep my flow

[Verse 1: Craig Mack]
Peace to Brentwood Town Shipping
I'm smoother than that Lex your whipping
With the rack and pinion
And Pirelli tires that be gripping
Sometimes I wonder if MCs really know
Mack's eternal bought to burn you
While in ten feet, of snow
I grab the mic and turn into Ali Baba
With just a dabber, my rhymes are guaranteed to grab ya
I got funk with the bass and soul
Cause I've been rockin' on the mic since nine years old
And I can groove with that, stupid fat
Rhymers when you're soupin' that
MCs catch a headache
And find where some Nuprins at
I'm on the case like Magnum P.I., F.B.I
Lookin for a man with the reason why
And it'll cost more than Lee Majors
To fix MCs after I kicks my flavor
Puff and Puff and blow the House down
Is what the Mack do whenever I get down
Gettin' down, boy (get down)
One two, Mack man's in full effect

[Chorus: Diddy]
Gotta get the cash, gotta get the dough
Gotta keep my flow
Gotta get the cash, gotta get the dough
Gotta keep my flow
Gotta get the cash, gotta get the dough
Gotta keep my flow

[Verse 2: Craig Mack]
I'm like the greatest rapper, known to man
Got MCs meltin' in mouth and not inside my hand (c'mon)
And you can try to, write a rhyme-a
But the pace that I race'll have you lookin' like a old timer (old timer)
Do you wanna pay a visit, to rhyme exquisite (aheh)
That'll leave you standin' colder than a winter blizzard (AHH)
Mack's engaging, extra blazin'
Who's you phasing?
Power Rangers ain't more amazin' (amazin')
Rhyme flipper, flip-a-rhyme=a-ripper (uh-huh, say what)
Rip-a-rhyme-double-dipper while you talkin' on my zipper
I wanna know who's been naughty or nice
With the device, turnin' grown men into mice (yeah)
I can flip funk back and forth, forth and back
Ride more super rhymes against the track, tell 'em Mack (tell em)
I got Bad Boy as my back (that's right)
As we kick on the funk called MC subtract
Got flow for days, got rhymes to amaze (uh-huh, c'mon)
Got the brand new funk, here's the brand new craze, boy
Mack the dope (one two)
We break all of the funk on down (yeah)

[Chorus: Diddy & Craig Mack]
Gotta get the cash, gotta get the dough (Mo Bee, make it..)
Gotta keep my flow (Bustin out, in the house)
Gotta get the cash, gotta get the dough
Gotta keep my flow
Gotta get the cash, gotta get the dough
(One two, as we get busier)
Gotta keep my flow
Gotta get the cash, gotta get the dough (We gon' get like this)
Gotta keep my flow

[Verse 3: Craig Mack]
Come on everybody, let's all get down
Got rhymes by the ton while you weighs a pound (Whoo)
Supercalifragilistic type of hyper MC
That be me, twenty-twenty could not see (Can't see)
I don't feel the pressure, of an MC aggressor
That I got a rhyme for in my top dresser
(in your top dresser) Craig Mack, Bad Boy representin
Fat Funkster be gettin', for Fat Funk be hittin' (C'mon)
It's this man's turn to earn
Since my birth, a penny now is MC's worth (C'mon)
And MC's are nuttin' but a joke-a take a toke-a
Smoke fatter than the Ayatollah
Can't nuttin' ever stop the Craig Mack plans
To grab MCs, and crush em in my hands (as we get busier)
Like I said before, here comes the Mack
Power-packed in black, to make you see mad graphics
As we get busier (As we get busier)
In nine-four with the funk that hits on the floor

[Chorus: Diddy]
Gotta get the cash, gotta get the dough
Gotta keep my flow
Gotta get the cash, gotta get the dough
Gotta keep my flow
Gotta get the cash, gotta get the dough
Gotta keep my flow
Gotta get the cash, gotta get the dough
Gotta keep my flow
Gotta get the cash, gotta get the dough
Gotta keep my flow
Gotta get the cash, gotta get the dough
Gotta keep my flow
Gotta get the cash, gotta get the dough
Gotta keep my flow
Gotta get the cash, gotta get the dough (rock on, rock on, rock on)
Gotta keep my flow
Gotta get the cash, gotta get the dough (rock on, rock on, rock on)
Gotta keep my flow
