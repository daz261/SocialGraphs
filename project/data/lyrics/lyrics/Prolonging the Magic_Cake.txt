I had a match, but she had a lighter
I had a flame, but she had a fire
I was bright, but she was much brighter
I was high, but she was the sky

Oh baby, I was bound for mexico
Oh baby, I was bound to let you go
Ha ha ha, la da da

I don't know much about Cinco de Mayo
I'm never sure what it's all about
But I say I want you and you don't believe me
You say you want me but I've got my doubts

Oh baby, I was bound for Mexico
Oh baby, I was bound to let you go

I had a match, but she had a lighter
I had a flame, but she had a fire
I was bright, but she was much brighter
I was high, but she was the sky

Oh baby, I was bound for Mexico
Oh baby, I was bound to let you go

 

[Intro]
I need your arms around me
I need to feel your touch
I need your understanding
I need your love so much

[Verse 1]
You tell me that you love me so
You tell me that you care
But when I need you (Baby)
Baby, you're never there

[Verse 2]
On the phone long, long distance
Always through such strong resistence
And first you say you're too busy
I wonder if you even miss me

[Chorus]
Never there
You're never there
You're never ever, ever, ever there
Hey!

[Verse 3]
A golden bird that flies away
A candle's fickle flame
To think I held you yesterday
Your love was just a game
A golden bird that flies away
A candle's fickle flame
To think I held you yesterday
Your love was just a game

[Verse 1]
You tell me that you love me so
You tell me that you care
But when I need you (Baby)
Baby

[Verse 4]
Take the time to get to know me
If you want why can't you just show me?
We're always on this roller coaster
If you want me why can't you get closer?

[Chorus]
Never there
You're never there
You're never ever, ever, ever there
Never there
You're never there
You're never ever, ever, ever there
Hey!

[Outro]
Oooh, hey!
Yeah!
Hey!
