Small town people live small lives
I swear they take you for a ride
Every day I hear the same
It's always someone else to blame
And it makes me mad

Annabelle's making me sad
With all of her hearsay
And it makes me mad
Annabelle's making me sad
With all of her hearsay, hearsay

Some of the lies I've tried to hush
Would have made Godiva blush
Kitchen drama full of soap
(Inside your pockets)
Low on life and high on hope
And it makes me mad

Annabelle's making me sad
With all of her hearsay
And it makes me mad
Annabelle's making me sad
With all of her hearsay, hearsay

Always crying on my shoulder
Creeping 'round from home to home

Annabelle's making me sad
With all of her hearsay
And it makes me mad
Annabelle's making me sad
With all of her hearsay, hearsay, hearsay

So sad
