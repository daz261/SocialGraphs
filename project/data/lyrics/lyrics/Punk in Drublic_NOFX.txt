[Verse 1]
Breathe ever so soft
We wouldn't wanna break the eggs as we walk
Never alone, cautious, afraid
I hear the voice of reason on the PA
Leave it alone, follow the grain
We couldn't stop the irresistible force
Leave it the same, change with the leaves
Bringing in the sheaves, bringing in the old
Leave it alone

[Chorus]
Da-na-na na-na na-na na
Da-na-na na-na na-na na
Da-na-na na-na na-na na
Da-na-na na-na na-na na

[Verse 2]
Breathe ever so slight
We couldn't take away your God given right
Leave it alone, heel and stay
Roll over and shake and beg for the bone
Leave it alone

[Chorus]
Da-na-na na-na na-na na
Da-na-na na-na na-na na
Da-na-na na-na na-na na
Da-na-na na-na na-na na
