Your pockets are full
Of stolen glasses
But what's the point?
You've had your fill
You've had your fill

You shed your skin
You're one of them
That somber fool
Escape while you can
Escape while you can

You're coming out of your shell
You've got a beautiful view
You're gonna shake it off

This is the place
That you were born
It's making a comeback
Since you've been gone
Since you've been gone

Don't waste your time
Learning Klingon
It ain't no use
Escape while you can
Escape while you can

You're coming out of your shell
You've got a beautiful view
You're gonna shake it off

[Instrumental Break]

You're coming out of your shell
You've got a beautiful view
You're gonna shake it off

 

Sneakin' a kiss
On the fire escape
A little game of pup tent
With a blanket and a broom
My mind is taking photographs
Of every little thing
Exhibit number 2 ...
A piece of white chocolate

And if you want me to
I'm gonna cry you a river tonight
And if you ask me to
I'm gonna crawl right into your dreams
And did you know
I feel a chokin' in the back of my throat

I see you walkin'
Walkin' on tippytoes
Swayin' like a sunflower
On a Spanish afternoon
My mind is taking photographs
Of every little thing
Exhibit number 8 ...
Don't be late

You crept in
Underneath the radar
Living in a glass house
Sleeping on a glass bed
But my mind has taken photographs
Of every little thing
Honey turn around
And the shame remains
