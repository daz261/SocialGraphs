You don't own me, fuck
You don't own me, fuck
You don't own me, fuck
You don't own me, fuck

You hold me down
You hold me down like a magnet

And this is not all that I am
No this is not

I've got the love that's strong and not weak
I've got the love that's strong and not weak
I've got the love that's strong and not weak
I've got the love that's strong and not weak
