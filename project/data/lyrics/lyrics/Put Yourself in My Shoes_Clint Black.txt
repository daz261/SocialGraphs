The Texas coastline hold her close
Just like a lady
And in their time they've
Weathered a storm or two
The river feed her waters
Like I feed your memory
The deeper I go the more I'm turning blue

The sandy beaches drift in time
And the changing tide I know
Won't bring me back to yesterday
And the Gulf of Mexico

The sails out on the water
Will come take you away
When your ship comes in
I know its time to go
And the waves along the seawall
Tell me nothings here to stay
And no man is an island
But I'm still all alone

I'm weighing anchors from the past
As the south winds start to blow
Sailing out of yesterday
And the Gulf of Mexico

I'll be sailing out of yesterday
And the Gulf of Mexico...

 

[Verse 1]
Ain't that the way the luck goes
Seems like it never can be found
Break my back to make those bank notes
Payin' on an almost always broken down
Fix that car nine ways to Sunday
And it won't start again when Monday rolls around

[Verse 2]
Ain't that the way the rent goes
Seems like it's never goin' down
And that banker's bound to foreclose
At this rate, I'll lose my interest in this town
Paint the walls, mend the windows
'Bout the time the roof comes crumblin' to the ground

[Chorus]
I've been footin' the bill for some time
Stretchin' my credit out of line
Well I may not get ahead but now I won't be far behind
I've got one more payment and it's mine
We're gonna swing it

[Verse 3]
Ain't that the way the heart goes
Seems they just attack without a sign
My mind's been on vacation
And my body's been workin' overtime
But I've done all that I can do
There's just one more balance due before it's mine

[Chorus]
I've been footin' the bill for some time
Step by step and line by dotted line
Well I haven't bought the farm yet but I'm not that far behind
I've got one more payment and it's mine

[Tag]
One more payment and it's mine
One more payment and it's mine
One more, one more, one more Lord

 

[Verse 1]
Maybe I took for granted you'd be around
To pick me up on my way down
I thought my feet were planted firmly on the ground
'Til one day my whole world came unwound

[Verse 2]
Like a ball of yarn kept neatly on a spool
You held the life together of this broken hearted fool
And what was once the exception
Now seems to be the rule

[Chorus]
There's a burning question, afire in my mind
You always had the answers to the ones I couldn't find
So all I'm asking is
Where are you now

[Verse 3]
What Father Time would sell me, I'd take it all
If only you'd be back around
But then if time should spell me I might take the call
But there's no way of knowing where I'm bound

[Verse 4]
So here it comes, another fine mess I've got into
And if I knew which way to turn I'd still turn to you
So if everything is said and done
What am I supposed to do

[Chorus]
That's the burning question, on fire in my mind
You always had the answers for me, time after time
So all I'm asking is
Where are you now

[Tag]
All I'm asking is
Where are you now
