[Intro]
Here we go
Yo

[Verse 1]
A day in the life of a player named Quik
I'm just a stubborn kind of fellow with a head like a brick
And just because I drink the eight, they say that I'm hopeless
But I don't give a fuck, so blame it on the loc-ness
Now this is how we do it when we checkin a grip
Teddy Bear is in the house, so don't even trip
We're bustin funky compositions as smooth as a prism
So check it while I kick it to this funky ass rhythm
It's Friday morning, the phone is ringin' off the hook
And AMG is in the den reviewin' rhymes in his notebook
Or should I say dope sack, because we don't bust wack
I pick up the phone and it's the D (Wassup, nigga?)
He said he's comin' down about two on the dot
So I'm about to rush the tub while my water's still hot
And now I'm soakin', a brother like the devestatin' DJ Quik ain't jokin'
Fuck with me on DSP and you'll get broken
My name is Quik, but you can call me daddy
Yo, open up the door 'cause here come Freak-man in a Caddy
Now Freaky's in the El-Dog and Shabby's in the El-Co
And everybody's sippin on a quart (Here we go!)
D just came with a forty and a quart
In addition to the three that Greedy just bought
But I don't wanna start early, so I just might
Put my forty in the freezer 'cause I wanna get bent

[Chorus]
Tonight
Tonight is the night (Yeah)
Tonight
Tonight is the night
Tonight
Tonight is the night (Yo, when we gone get bent?)
Tonight
Tonight is the night (Aw yeah)

[Verse 2]
And now I'm out of the tub, I'm feelin' fancy free
Spray on some Xeryus and put on my Givenchy
Sweatsuit, the gray one with the burgundy trim
And it's a medium, fit me proper 'cause I'm nice and slim
Five thirty on the clock and the sun is steadily sinkin'
And I am steadily thinkin' about the eight that I'll be drinkin'
You know I ain't ashamed and you know I ain't bashful
So go on and pop the forty so I can pour me a glassful
Hamm is in the bedroom rollin' up a stencil
Fatter than a pinky and the length of a pencil
Freaky lit it up and hit it one, two, three
Shabby took a hit and then they pass it to me
(It's the bomb!)
Yo, I can feel my senses (Gettin' numb!)
Yo, fuck the forty ounce (I need some rum!)
I'm chillin' like a villain (Here I come!)
And that's how I'm livin'
Tonight is the night and I'm lookin' real sporty
Proper Friday evening, and I'm ready to party
Crusher came in with a handful of snaps
Fuck it, let's shoot some craps
(Yo what they in fo'?) A fin or a half
(Yo shoot that ten, nigga!) Don't make me laugh
Hi-C won a dub and he think that shit is funny
But I'm seven and eleven and I'm takin' niggas money

[Chorus]
Tonight
Tonight is the night (Yeah, watch me bust a ho)
Tonight
Tonight is the night (Passin' naturals on motherfuckers)
Tonight
Tonight is the night (Yo, I'm unfadeable)
Tonight
Tonight is the night (ahh, let's break it down, so I can get funky)
Tonight

Ahh yeah
Givin' em somethin they can roll on
Hold on

[Verse 3]
Wake up Saturday morning, and I got a headache
I can't believe that I'm sick from all the shit that I drank
(Last night)
Soon as I felt it comin' on, I shoulda quit
It's true that a drunk ain't shit
To the man up above to whom thanks I give
I'll never drink again if you just let me live
Mike P spoke to me and I said I couldn't call it
Callin' Earl like a mother while I'm grippin the toilet
I need a 7-Up, because my head is spinnin
Round and round, I think I better sit down
My homey Shot is alright, but I'm feeling faint
I guess he's used to it, but a nigga like Quik ain't
K is on the phone, and Teddy's at the door
And some fine ass bitches comin over at four
(I thought you wasn't drinkin no more) Yeah right
Because as soon as they come, we doin' the same ol' shit tonight

[Chorus/Outro]
Tonight
Tonight is the night (Yeah)
Tonight
Tonight is the night (Straight gettin' fucked up, hey)
Tonight
Tonight is the night (Fuck that pass me that pi√±a colada man, I don't wanna fade that eight ball no mo')
Tonight
Tonight is the night (That shit be fuckin' a nigga up)
Tonight
Tonight is the night (Aw yeah, nothin' but a party and I'm kickin' it)
Tonight (What's up Greedy Greg?)
Tonight is the night (How you livin?)
Tonight (Hey, somebody get that nigga a Genuine Draft)
Tonight is the night
Tonight (Yeah)
Tonight is the night (And on that motherfuckin' note, I'm outta here)
Tonight (See ya)

To-To-To-Tonight
Tonight
Tonight
Tonight
To-To-To-Tonight
Tonight
Tonight
To-To-To-Tonight
Tonight
Tonight
We out (What about peace?)
Fuck peace, nigga, give me another brew

 

[Verse 1]
Now everybody wants to know the truth about a brother named Quik
I come from the school of the sly, wicked and the slick
A lot of people already know exactly where it's at
'Cause it's the home of the jackers and the crack
(Compton) Yeah, that's the name of my hometown
I'm throwing down in the town where my name is all around
The suckers just be havin' a fit, and that's a pity
But I ain't doing nothing but (claiming my city)
See, my lyrics I'm doubling up and proving to suckers that I can throw em
I'm passing a natural ten or four or six or eight before I go
Yes, I'm definitely freestyling, all the while still profiling
Never tricks, the DJ Quikster steals the show
So that's how I'm livin', I do as I please, you see
A younger brother that's up on reality
'Cause everybody knows you have to be stomping
If you're born and raised in Compton

[Hook]
(Born and raised)
(Born and raised)
(Born and raised in Compton)

(Where you from, fool?)
(Compton)

[Verse 2]
Now Compton is the place where the homeboys chill, you see
But then I found that it wasn't no place for me
Cause way back in the day somebody must of wanted me to quit
Because they broke in my house and cold stole my shit
They musta thought that I was gonna play the punk role
Just because my equipment got stole
But I ain't going out like no sucker-ass clown
They found they couldn't keep a dope nigga down
So here's some bass in your face, muthafucka silly sucker-
Ass clucker, now you're duckin', 'cause you can't stop a brother
Like the Quiksta, because I'm true to the game
You're lame, and things ain't going never be the same
'Cause a nigga like the Quik is takin' over
I really don't think I should have to explain
It, oh yeah, I'm a dog, but my name ain't Rover
And I'm the kinda nigga that's feeling no pain
Sometimes I have to wear a bullet-proof vest
Because I got the 'CPT' sign written across my chest
A funky dope brother never ceases to impress
My name is DJ Quik, so you can fuck the rest
I'm comin like this, and I'm comin directly
Cause suckers get dain-bramaged if I'm doin damage quite effectively
Rhymin is a battlezone, and suckers have no win
'Cause I'm a veteran from the C-O-M-P-T-O-N
Kick it

(Born and raised)

Hell muthafuckin yeah
Funky dope for the nine-ace
DJ Quik is in the muthafuckin house
Yeah

(Born and raised in Compton)

[Outro]
Yo, check this shit out
Right about now
I'd like to send a shout out to my buddy Teddy Bear
What's up, nigga?
What's up KK?
My buddy D
We got AMG most definitely in the house
What's up Greedy Greg and Big Baby Brian cold chillin'
Talkin' about the Armstrong Pack
Straight got my muthafuckin' back
To my buddy NOE what's up, fool
Roche is in the house
My buddy Donzelle
You know what's happenin', fool
What's up, Inch?
And Tony Lane is chillin'
To my nigga Gangsta Wayne
And my engineer Joe gettin busy on the flo'
And last but not least I'd like to thank Shabby Blue
And we out
Peace
