Please, there's no need for any thank you's
For loving you so faithfully
From the moment that we met
Something in me said that you would do the same for me

When we walked down the aisle of the chapel
And I promised my love would always be
When I looked into your eyes
It was then I realized, that you would do the same for me

Together through the years of laughter and tears
I have kept that promise honestly
When temptation came along, I was able to be strong
Knowing you would do the same for me

If anyone should ask me why I will love you 'til I die
I'll say you would do the same for me
I'll just say you would do the same for me

 

So you saw her last night with her new love
Yes they tell me they make quite a pair
And that they both look happy together
I just wonder not that I care

Tell me was she as lovely as ever
Like an angel with golden hair
Does she still close her eyes when she dances
I just wonder not that I care

Once I thought I couldn't live without her
Funny how wrong I could be
Now I never even think about her
What she does doesn't mean a thing to me

Well it's late so I guess I'll be going
Too much smoke what I need is some air
By the way did she ask you about me
I just wonder not that I care

I just wonder not that I care

 

I heard him say: I love you
I heard him say: Forever
And without you, he'd rather be dead
I felt my hands shaking
I felt my heart breaking
'Cause I meant every word he said

I saw him whisper something
Then I saw you look so happy
It's a look I won't ever forget
'Cause whatever he told you
Meant I'd never hold you
And I meant every word he said

His heart stole those words from my head
Now, it's too late to tell you what he's already said

I heard him say: I love you
I heard him say: Forever
Then he said: With this ring, I thee wed
And when he said: I do
I choked back: I do, too
And I meant every word he said

His heart stole those words from my head
Now it's too late to tell you what he's already said

I heard him say: I love you
I heard him say: Forever
Then he said: With this ring, I thee wed
And when he said: I do
I choked back: I do, too
'Cause I meant every word he said

 

You've got me callin' on the phone
You've got me cryin' all night long
But, baby, I love you, baby, yes, I love you

Heard people sayin' lots of things
'Bout how you sold your wedding ring
But, baby, I love you, baby, yes, I love you

But I don't care what people say
I still love you anyway
Oh yes, I love you, I still love you

Missed you most of all this year
I must have cried a million tears
'Cause, baby, I love you, baby, yes, I love you

But I don't care what people say
I still love you anyway
Oh yes, I love you, I still love you

But I don't care what people say
I still love you anyway
Oh yes, I love you, I still love you

But I don't care what people say
I still love you anyway
Oh yes, I love you, I still love you
