You talks as if in riddles
You talk as if in rhymes
Down in the lion's lair
Stroke yourself to feel so fine
And what are you afraid of
Afraid to get so touched
When you begin to feel
Is it way, way too much

Have you lost your sense of purpose
And who can stand alone
There's no more circus here
There's nothing carved in stone
I see you down in the desert
And on a lonely beach
I'll hold you in those places
Where no one else can reach you

For comfort there

CHORUS
In your wildest dreams
We can talk until we say something
It don't mean a thing
I will be there
When you come back down oh yeah

I'll hold you in the desert
And on a lonely beach
I'll hold you in these places
Where no one else can reach you
The words cannot reveal this

Nothing's carved in stone
So maybe don't hide around it
This is something you can own

I want you when you're bad
I want you when you're good
I want you when you won't
And when you think you should
I want you when you're angry
And when you come back down
I'll hold you above water
When you think that you might drown

Go under

CHORUS

I look back in
And you'll be smiling once again
I turn around
Just as the sun comes shining in on you
We have not lost
But just begun

CHORUS

In your wildest dreams
We can talk until we say something
It don't mean a thing
For now and ever
We've just begun

 

I'm so tired of all this crap
That falls from you like rain
Do you think that I'm that naive
Or have you gone insane
You can fly 6000 miles
And think its no big deal
And turn and come back in
Anytime you feel
If there's something more need
I cried for you, I would've died for you
Tell it to someone who wants to hear
When the silence starts to haunt you

Just scream
Let the voices out, lord
Just scream
Let the voices out

Someone calls me up
And says that you want out
Cause you don't have the guts yourself
And is there any doubt
That you don't know yourself
What you do and don't believe
Are delusions are your own way
Of escaping reality

Let your conscience be your guide
What's real to you
How does it feel to you

Don't believe all that's fed to you
And when the silence starts to haunt you

Just scream

Now it's gone for sure
And your hands wet on the wheel
Does it feel like the world stopped it's turning

Just scream
Just scream
Let the voices out, lord
Just scream
Let the voices know you're there

Has he gotten all he needs
It's so easy
It's so sleazy
To steel from someone who's back is turned
When the karma starts to break through

Just scream
Let the voices out, lord
Just scream
Like I did for you

Just scream
Let the voices out, lord
Just scream
