Rain falls, pours down
Four years no sound
There's all these broken bottles over the floor
Let's got outta here
Behind us close the doors

Paua shell shimmer on
Shattered glass crushed among
Why keep this broken vase alive?
Let's just get in the car and let's just drive

Build it right up, knock it right down
Where the light blinds me, I'm nowhere to be found
Catch my, drift away instead
Let's see what the road holds up ahead
