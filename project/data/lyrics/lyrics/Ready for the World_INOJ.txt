[Verse 1]
I got a thing to say
I gotta see your face
Cause baby, oh, I've change
I gotta break it down to you

Now don't forget it's me
You say you know, these thangs
It ain't the same, no baby
I don't want you looking like fool

[Chorus]
Baby, I'm falling out of love with you
I can't go on pretending that I love you
Baby, I'm falling out of love with you
I can't go on pretending that I want you
Don't want your love

[Verse 2]
I can't pretend, no more
I had to let you know
I didn't want to make you wait
To find out that my loving wasn't true

Didn't wanna tell you friends
I knew that they would tell you then
And that'll break your heart again
And I want us to continue being friends, but

[Chorus]
Baby, I'm falling out of love with you (falling out of love)
I can't go on, pretending that I love you (that I love you)
Baby, I'm falling out of love with you
I can't go on pretending that I want you
Dunt want ur love no more

[Bridge]
Living on lies
You know I've tried
Living on night tears and all the crying
No, no, no, no
I'm through with all these gifts, doing all these things
You know what I'm saying babe?
Don't want your love no more

[Chorus]
Baby, I'm falling out of love with you
(falling out of love)
I can't go on pretending that I love you
(I don't love you baby, no)
Baby, I'm falling out of love with you
I'm falling out of love with you
I can't no, faking my love no more
Don't wanna break your heart, no, no
But you gotta know
That I really cared
The loving that I'm giving ain't true
I can't go on
I can't go on, no (woah)

Baby (baby) I'm (I'm) falling out of love with you
(falling out of love)
I can't go on, pretending that I love you (that I love you)
No, no
No, no
I can't go on, pretending that I love you
I'm falling into, into another love
