[Verse 1]
[Spoken:] What you looking at, girl?
She's always checking with her penthouse eyes
Makes me stutter, gives me butterflies

[Chorus 1]
Got to have her, she pins me up with her penthouse eyes

[Verse 2]
I want to lie where her eagle flies
She's got my love pressure on the rise

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]
Don't need excuse for grasping
Can't blame the boy for asking
One look sting you like a honey bee
But it's her eyes gonna set you free

[Verse 3]
I want to stretch her out in old Levi's
Got to have a little piece of paradise

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

 

[Verse 1]
I gotta find out what's in my mind
I'm a little mixed up but it feels so fine
Why does love have to come and go
If it's got to leave why does it go so slow?

[Chorus]
Just tell it
Tell it like it is
Tell it
Tell it like it feels
Tell it to my baby

[Verse 2]
I have a feeling that I'm going insane
I've fallen in love but can't remember her name
She probably stepped out and she's coming back again
But if I don't know her how can I let her in?

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
[Spoken]
Fine
So fine

[Outro]
How could this ever have happened this way?
Well, sometimes love turns out that way
Sometimes it's cold and sometimes it's hot
But it's better to have it than to need it and not
