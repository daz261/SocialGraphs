[Verse 1]
I am a message, prescient
Forecasting, there is a limit
So take my temperature
You say:
"Your turn"
But I think
This invite's open to all

[Hook]
So come on
Take your medicine
Hey doctor, heal yourself
Or you got too much to lose?
So come on
Take your medicine
Hey doctor, now
Come on

[Verse 2]
You are a message, precious
Extracting, forging a tactic
To get your motion through
You say
"Don't know, not sure"
But I think
No holster's empty for you

[Hook]
So come on
Take your medicine
Hey doctor, heal yourself
Or you got too much to lose?
So come on
Take your medicine
Hey doctor, come on now
Let's go

[Bridge]
Shoot out and shoot out the shadows
Shoot out and shoot out the shadows
Shoot out and shoot out the shadows
Yeah

[Outro]
This latest disgrace
Let's ... [???]
Get the notion [?]
