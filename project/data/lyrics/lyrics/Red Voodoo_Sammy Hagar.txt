South Carolina, down in Myrtle Beach
Dance to the music, twistin' to the beat
Shimmy shimmy shake it, shimmy shakin' coco pop
Turn me on, babe, and don't stop

You make me wanna shag you, baby
You know I wanna shag you, baby, wooh
I gotta shag you, baby
You make me wanna shag you, baby

Turn on the lights, I got to see you comin'
Turn on the key and get your motor hummin'
I been smokin' lightning, make me hear the thunder
I feel your body tighten from under

You make me wanna shag you, baby, uh
I gotta shag you, baby, wooh
You know I gotta shag you, baby
I wanna shag you, baby, shag you, baby, shag you, baby

Ooh, shag you, baby, hey
Uh, shag you, baby
You know I wanna shag you, honey
You make me wanna, uh uh uh uh uh
I gotta shag you, baby

Turn on the lights, I got to see ya comin'
Turn on the key and get your motor hummin'
I like smokin' lightning, you make me hear the thunder
I feel your body tighten from under

You make me wanna shag you, baby, uh
You know I gotta shag you, baby, wooh
I wanna shag you, baby, uh huh
