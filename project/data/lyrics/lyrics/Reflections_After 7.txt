[Verse 1: Melvin Edmonds]
The first time that I saw you
I knew I would fall in love
You filled an empty space in my heart
And that was rather special
‘Cause I never thought someone
Could make me fall in love from the start
Girl, you know the second time I saw you
I knew that I had been whupped
I could not get you out of my mind
Oh, and ever since that moment
Girl I haven't been much good
I won't rest until I know that you're mine
All mine, oh

[Chorus]
Don't you hear me crying for it
Don't you see my heart's on fire
Don't you feel me dying for it
Give me my heart’s desire

[Verse 2: Kevon Edmonds]
The first time that I saw you
I knew that you were the one
You were everything a man could desire
And I've always been the kind of man
To get just what he wants
So please don't make me out as a liar
The second time I saw you
I just had to have you, girl
I've never seen someone look so good
And ever since that day
I just haven't been the same
I want you girl and I want that understood

[Chorus 2X]
Don't you hear me crying for it
Don't you see my heart's on fire
Don't you feel me dying for it
Give me my heart’s desire

[Bridge]
And I won't be any good
If I can't have you now
If there's any way you could
Come to me now
I'd give you anything
And I do mean everything
And that means anything that your heart desires

[Chorus 2X]
Don't you hear me crying for it
Don't you see my heart's on fire
Don't you feel me dying for it
Give me my heart’s desire

Hey girl I got it for ya'
In a real bad way
So baby you could push me 'round
Push me down your way
I don't care anywhere's good down there
But baby in the back of your mind
You want to feel me sliding up your leg
Oh yeah

Take your time
Let's make sure the feeling's right
I wanna know what's up
Should we stop or should we

Save it up, save it up
Save it up for me baby
Shooby-doop you my baby
'cause you know you're just
Drivin' me crazy
Save it up baby love
Don't hold back your lovin'
Shooby-doop you my baby
'cause you know you just
Drivin' me crazy

Sweet thang candy got ya'meltin'
In your flame
'cause baby you're safe and warm
Given into the game
Oh way down there
Deep in your ocean way
Send me down there girl
I'll find your pearl
At the end of the day
Ease your mind
Let's make sure the mood's alright
I wanna fill your cup
So what's up or should we

Baby what's your name
Come and let me see your love baby
I just wanna know your name
Baby what's your name
Come and show me your love
