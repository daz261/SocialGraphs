Midnight comes
And the devil's loose
What you want
He's got everything there
What you've got
He'll take
And leave you in the cold

One more soul drowns
Another deal goes down
The night is full of danger
Another deal goes down

On the street
The refugees
From a war
That was lost in the heart
One one wants
To see them
And the fire is burning slow

One more soul drowns
Another deal goes down
The night is full of danger
Another deal does down

Tell me what you're searching for, will you sister
Emptiness inside
You will never fill it up with another thrill

Money spent
All the words are said
Nothing helps
Streets are falling apart
Through the night
They're burning
And the devil's on a roll

One more soul drowns
Another deal goes down
The night is full of danger
Another deal goes down
