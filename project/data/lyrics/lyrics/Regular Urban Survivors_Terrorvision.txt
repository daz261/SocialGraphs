I was high on a Molotov of cocktails
I was low on a hundred things
I was wrong to put my money where my mouth was
I was right about the whales and the dolphins
Whales and dolphins, whales and dolphins, yeah
And I don't mind preserving time at all
I was blue about the people in the power
I was green that's my excuse
I was yellow when they said to fight the reds
'Cos I knew I'd be beaten black and blue
Black and blue, battered and bruised, yeah
Hold the line, just give it some time then (call)...
"Cor", what I like and what I hate about perseverance
Ooh, what I'd give and what I'd take for perseverance
I was round and about in the area
I was wearing my suit and tie
I was lost in the Bermuda triangle
It all went pear-shaped, twisted and twined
Twisted and twined, twisted and twined, yeah
And I don't mind preserving time at all
Hold the line, just give it some time then (call)...
"Cor", what I like and what I hate about perseverance
Ooh, what I'd give and what I'd take for perseverance
I was lost on the road to nowhere
I was a guest on a runaway train
I was happy 'cos I knew I was innocent
They were glad to let me take the blame
Taking the blame, taking the blame, taking the blame
It's always the same 'cos
I... what I like and what I hate about perseverance
Ooh, what I'd give and what I'd take for perseverance
I haven't time, I haven't space for perseverance
'Cos I swap and change just when I like to keep up appearance
