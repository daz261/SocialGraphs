If you see me
If you see me
Just go away
Just go away

If I run
If I run
Don't follow me
Just go away

Cuz I like you
But baby it's all wrong

If I run don't you think
You know what I want
Cuz I like you
But baby it's all wrong

Oh baby it's all wrong
Oh baby it's all wrong
It feels good
It's all wrong
It feels good
It's all wrong
It feels so good
It must be wrong
It feels so good
It must be wrong

Cuz I like you
But baby it's all wrong
