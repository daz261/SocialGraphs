[Verse 1]
You say I need a job
I've got my own business
You want to know what I do?
None of your fucking business
But now I'm lying here
And knowing that business
I had a name, but now I'm a number

[Chorus]
1-2-3 Repeater
Repeater
Repeater
1, 2, 3
Repeater
Repeater

[Verse 2]
Down by law
I've got this nasty habit
When I need something
I just reach out and grab it
Once upon a time I had a name and a way
But to you I'm nothing but a number

[Chorus]
1-2-3 Repeater
Repeater
Repeater
1, 2, 3
Repeater
Repeater

[Verse 3]
Did you hear something outside?
It sounded like a gun
Stay away from that window, boy
It's not anyone that we know
Only about ourselves and
What we read in the paper
Don't you know ink washes out
Easier than blood
But we don't have to try it
And we don't have to buy it

[Bridge]
You've got
You've got
You've got

[Outro]
1, 2, 3 go!
Repeater

 

[Instrumental]

 

[Verse 1]
When we have nothing left to give
There will be no reason for us to live
But when we have nothing left to lose
You will have nothing left to use

[Chorus]
We owe you nothing
You have no control
We owe you nothing
You have no control

[Verse 2]
Merchandise, it keeps us in line
Common sense says it's by design
What could a businessman ever want more
Than to have us sucking in his store

[Chorus]
We owe you nothing
You have no control
We owe you nothing
You have no control

[Reprise]
You are not what you own
You are not what you own
You are not what you own
You are not what you own

[Chorus]
We owe you nothing
You have no control
We owe you nothing (nothing)
You have no control
We owe you nothing (nothing)
You have no control

 

I'm not playing with you
I'm not playing with you
I'm not playing with you, yeah, you

I'm not playing with you
I'm not playing with you
I'm not playing with you, yeah, you

I'm not playing with you
I'm not playing with you
I'm not playing with you, yeah, you

I'm not playing with you
I'm not playing with you
I'm not playing with you
I clean forgot how to play

But you can still come around
In fact I invite you down
Maybe together
We can wipe that smile off your face
'Cause what a difference
What a difference
What a difference
A little difference would make

We'll draw a blueprint
It must be easy
It's just a matter
Of knowing when to say no or yes

Frustrating, frustrating
Always waiting for the bigger axe to fall
A patient game I can't find my way to play

Find my way to play
Not knowing

Never mind what's been selling
It's what you're buying
And receiving undefiled

Never mind what's been selling
It's what you're buying
And receiving undefiled

Never mind what's been selling
It's what you're buying
And receiving undefiled

Never mind what's been selling
It's what you're buying
Receiving undefiled

Never mind
Never mind
Never mind
Not knowing the way to play

Never mind
Never mind
Never mind
Not knowing the way to play

Never mind
Never mind
Never mind
Not knowing the way to play

Never mind
Never mind
Never mind
Lost the way

Not knowing the way to play
Not knowing

 

Another sieve-fisted find
Lost, lost again

Here comes another problem
All wrapped up in solution
It's ugly as it's strapped on
Twice as hard to get behind

Another sieve-fisted find
Lost, lost again

Please
Please let me get my hands on it
Please let me get my, my, my
Please let me get my hands on it

Here comes that self-same problem
All stalled on same self again
It's as ugly as the last one
And twice as far from unwound
By this charged head standing
On this thin base of neck
And now I'm pushing past the red
I said I'm pushing past the red

Another sieve-fisted find
Lost, lost again

Sieve-fisted find
You find nothing
Sieve-fisted find
You find nothing

Another sieve-fisted find
Lost, lost again

Please
Please let me get my hands on it
Please let me get my, my, my, my, my, my
Please let me get my hands on it
My, my, my, my, my, yeah

You got it, you got it
You got it, you got it

 

[Verse 1]
I broke the surface so I can breathe
I close my eyes so I can see
I tie my arms to be free
Have you ever been free?

[Chorus]
She's not breathing
She's not moving
She's not coming back

[Verse 2]
I burn a fire to stay cool
I burn myself, I am the fuel
I never meant to be cruel
Have you ever been cruel?

[Chorus]
She's not breathing
She's not moving
She's not coming back, back, back

[Outro]
Shut the door, so I can leave
Shut the door
