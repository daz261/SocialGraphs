Journal entry number twenty
Getting older, feeling meaner
Thinking faster, getting even
Making standards, faking answers

Can you rewrite history?

A conversation with myself
Turning into something else
Risking my security
Losing my obscurity

Bored with my life, repetition
Waiting for the situation
Select problems impair decisions
Fearful living, nothing given

Can you rewrite history?

A conversation with myself
Turning into something else
Risking my security
Losing my obscurity

A conversation with myself
