Sing with me
That is where I'm at
Hoot with me
I'd get into that
If you know where I'm at
I would get a kick from that
Muddy face, bloody hand
Naked we dance on our clothes

So will you come with me?
I'll take you away

Spin with me
That's is what I feel
Open your arms
Release from within
If you know where I'm at
I would get a kick from that
Come the dark
Light a fire
In the rain we raise our heads

So will you come with me?
I'll blow you away
