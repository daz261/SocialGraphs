Well I'm standing on the launch pad
Looking at the stars
I'm waiting for the countdown to begin
I'm not sure where I'm going
No, I've no way of knowing

CHORUS

But when the signal comes
It's 5, 4, 3, 2, 1!
Baby I'm a Spacehog
A Spacehog, a Spacehog, a Spacehog

Well now I see the moon
We got here oh so soon
The earth looks very different from up here
I'm picking up strange signals
I hope I'll be okay

CHORUS
