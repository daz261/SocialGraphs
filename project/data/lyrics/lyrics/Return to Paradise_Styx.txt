One touch was all I needed to know
You were the one for me
My fate and my destiny
You smiled and all at once I could see
I'd found a love so true
That I could give all to you

And suddenly I realized
That all the fortune and fame
Can't compare to the sound of your voice
Whenever you speak my name

Paradise is anyplace where I can be with you
Leave behind the heartache and the pain that I've been through
Safe in your arms
Safe in the world tonight
For you are my paradise

My heart was broken so many times
I couldn't imagine when
I'd ever love again
But every time I look at you
I know that I've been blessed
For I'm sure I've found heaven on earth
Each time I feel your caress

'cause paradise is anyplace where I can be with you
Leave behind the heartache and the pain that I've been through
Safe in your arms
Safe in the world tonight
For you are my paradise

And all at once I realized
That all the fortune and fame
Can't compare to the sound of your voice
Whenever you call my name

'cause paradise is anyplace where I can be with you
And leave behind the heartache and the pain that I've been through
I'm safe in your arms
Safe in the world tonight
For you are my paradise
