One more day in the valley
Then I’m free to roam
One more night of insect bites
And beating myself to a foam
But that’s the way it goes, I suppose

Everything that you taught me
Was all I’ve ever known
We took this ride, side by side
But guess what? I got off alone
And that’s the way it goes, I suppose
And that’s the way it goes
But then again, who really knows?

When I walk into this room
I turn to stone
In this place that gave me sleep
That once upon a time I called home
That’s the way it goes, I suppose
That’s the way it goes
But then again, who really knows?
