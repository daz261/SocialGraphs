[Verse 1]
Suffocated by mirrors, stained by dreams
Her honey belly pulls the seams
Curves are still upon the hinge
Pale zeros tinge the tiger skin

[Verse 2]
Moist as grass, ripe and heavy as the night
The sponge is full, well out of sight
All around the conversations
Icing on the warm flesh cake

[Verse 3]
Light creeps through her secret tunnels
Sucked into the open spaces
Burning out in sudden flashes
Draining blood from well-fed faces

[Verse 4]
Desires form in subtle whispers
Flex the muscles in denial
Up and down its pristine cage
So the music, so the trial

[Chorus 1]
Vows of sacrifice, headless chickens
Dance in circles, they the blessed
Man and wife, undressed by all
Their grafted trunks in heat possessed

[Verse 6]
Even as the soft skins tingle
They mingle with the homeless mother
Who loves the day but lives another
That once was hers

[Verse 7]
The worried father, long lost lover
Brushes ashes with his broom
Rehearses jokes to fly and hover
Bursting over the bride and groom
And the talk goes on

[Bridge]
Memories crash on tireless waves
The lifeguards whom the winter saves
Memories crash on tireless waves
The lifeguards whom the winter saves

[Verse 8]
Silence falls the guillotine
All the doors are shut
Nervous hands grip tight the knife
In the darkness, 'til the cake is cut

[Chorus 2]
Passed around (passed around)
In little pieces (in little pieces)
The body (the body)
The body and the flesh
The family (the family)
And the fishing-net
And another (another)
In the mesh
The body, the body, and the flesh
