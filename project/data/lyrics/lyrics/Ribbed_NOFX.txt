Fight!

Talking about the Moron Bros
Tattooed fingers, tattooed toes

[Verse 1]
They're idiots, they're losers, they're scum
Taking advantage of everyone
You're a dog, they're your fleas
Doing everything they can to spread disease
Take your beer, take your drugs
They'll leave with you microscopic bugs
Their company is something you won't miss
When your icetrays are filled with piss

[Chorus]
They are the Moron Brothers
Don't get along with others
They are the Moron Brothers
Don't get along with others

They'll whine, they'll bitch, they'll fuck you if you're rich
They'll leech, they'll latch, they are the itch that you can't scratch

[Interlude]
Do, do-do do-do do
Do, do-do do-do do (Do, do-do do-do)
Do, do-do do-do do, do-do do-do do
Do-do do-do do, do-do-do-do-do!

[Verse 2]
They'll ink your face, tape your eyelids closed
Tobasco's in your mouth, there's mustard up your nose!
When your head's been shaved you'll think the worst has passed
Just try to move your leg; they've put you in a cast, yeah

[Chorus]

They may not go down in history
But they'll go down on your sister
