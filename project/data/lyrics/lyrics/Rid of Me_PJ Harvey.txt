[Verse 1]
He should not be hid
He's just too big
In a cloud please come down
I'd put stars at your feet
Put Mars in your head

[Verse 2]
Show yourself to me
And I'd believe
I'd moan and I'd weep
Fall silent at your speak
I'd burst in
Full to the brim

[Verse 3]
Mary lost her head
And let it bleed
Came crying back to me
"My son, where's he hid?
Don't deny it
And don't you hide him"

[Chorus]
No, I've missed him
No, I've missed him
No, I've missed him
No, I've missed him

[Verse 4]
No words
No sign
Mary say
"I'm not lying"
How come he's so big?
But good lord he's been hid
Good lord, where you hid?
Ha!

[Chorus]
No, I've missed him
No, I've missed him
No, I've missed him
No, I've missed him
No, I've missed him
No, I've missed him
No, I've missed him
No, I've missed him

 

[Intro]
Oh, you're divine
Oh, you're divine

[Verse 1]
Oh, oh
Did I tell you you're divine?
Oh, oh, oh
Did I ever when you were alive?

[Chorus 1]
Did it hurt when you bled?
Did it, oh lover boy, oh fever head?
I'll bet you never thought I'd try
Your mouth, my love, was open wide

[Verse 2]
Singing oh
You were going to be my life, dammit!
Oh, oh, oh
You were going to be my life

[Chorus 2]
Did you sing happy day?
Sing it, sing it that time I went away?
Got to ease my aching head
Ooh, no, no other way, cut off your legs

[Bridge]
Oh
Oh

[Chorus 3]
Did you ever wish me dead
Oh lover boy, oh fever head?
No you must, no you must not go away
How will you ever walk again?
And I, I might as well be dead

[Outro]
But I could kill you instead
