Going through old dresser drawers
Fumbling through these closets
It's got to be here somewhere
I know it's round here somewhere

Searching from room to room
We couldn't have just lost it
I know it's round here somewhere
It's got to be here somewhere

Maybe we packed it up
With college books and winter clothes
Things we thought were in the way
Out of style or just outgrown

Chorus:
We didn't give it away
We just left it alone
We tried to find it one day
That's when we noticed it gone
I turned the house upside down
Praying I'd stumble across
Some sign that it's still around
Got to find the love that we lost

Captured in old picture frames
Shining in those faces
It used to be here somewhere
I know it's still here somewhere
Reflected in our children's eyes
How could we misplace it
I know it was here yesterday
How could it just slip away
It was more then just a box of junk
We stored away to gather dust
This was a dream we thought
We always could reach out and touch

(Repeat Chorus twice)
Got to find the love that we lost

 

Columbus said the world was round
Back when everyone said it was flat
Just between me and you and the man in the moon
Baby, it ain't anything like that

'Cause we're living in a heart shaped world
Our head in the clouds, but our feet on the ground
Yeah, we're living in a heart shaped world
Don't you know, baby
Love makes the world go 'round

Now, satellite pictures sent back to earth
Shows a big, blue ball floatin out in space
We've got a vision, yeah
And we're on a mission
To tell the whole planet it ain't that way

'Cause we're living in a heart shaped world
Our head in the clouds, but our feet on the ground
Yeah, we're living in a heart shaped world
Don't you know, baby
Love makes the world go 'round

Don't you know, baby
Love makes the world go
Don't you know, baby
Love makes the world go 'round...
