[Intro: Violent J]
What can I say, man, I hit him with the brick
Killed the little prick, him and his chick
Tried to be slick but you ain't no Slinky
You're rinky, you're dinky, you suck my Twinkie
I don't give a fuck if you call me a clown
Break it on down, it's murder go round
What'cha dishing out, I catch, it comes back to ya
If you're trying to creep, I'd hate to say I never knew ya

[Verse 1: Violent J & Shaggy 2 Dope]
Once upon a time in the ghetto zone
A ten-foot lead pipe slapped on my dome
I'm laying in the street with blood oozing out my head
Excuse me, motherfucker, was it something I said
Forks up, forks down, man, forks sideways
Then he grabbed my Faygo and he said crime pays
Swung on his pipe once again for the road
"Hold up, dawg," Uh! this shit gets old
Now I walk the streets with a shattered skull
I'm gonna swing my axe through his jaw
Where the motherfucker at? Where the motherfuckers hang?
How ya gonna fuck with the juggla J-ay-ay?
There he sits so I knock on the door
Pops opened up *Pop* Pops hit the floor
Then I chop chop pops twice in his nugget
But he didn't do shit, fuck it
It's the murder go round

[Interlude]
Hey!
"I don't wanna die! I don't wanna die!
Hey! Hey!
"I don't wanna die! Stop! Please!"
Hey! Hey!
"Oh no! Stop! Stop!"

[Verse 2: Violent J & Shaggy 2 Dope]
Well, it's me and my mellow mellow roll on Military
Gangbangers gangbangers, big bang theory, kinda scary
Tags up all on the bricks
Latin Counts, X-Men, CFP and all that shit
We love gangbangers and we hope they love us back
We just some wicked clowns and it's been like that
I don't understand why some beefin' in town
We went nation-wide and still Southwest down
But this motherfucker gonna try and clown me
But I'm the juggalugalocoro, G
Took a shot and he missed, 2 Dope bit the dust
"What?! I ain't got shot, bitch!" So now you must
Take your ticket for the murder go round
Can't nobody kill a clack-clack clown
Seen him and his boys smoking blunt in a bucket
Pulled out the dagger, creeped up and I stuck it
Into his head, into his boy's head
Into his boy's head, his boy's head, his boy's head
Five dead fucks in the trunk I deliver
Push that old piece of shit in the river
They capped my boy, so 5 go down
And ya get a free ride ("No, not again") On the murder go round

[Interlude]
"No!"
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
"Help me! Ah, it hurts!"
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
"Get if off! Get it off!"
Hey!
"Stop!"

[Chorus]
Murder go round, murder go round
How ya gonna fuck with a wicked clown?
Murder go round, murder go round
How ya gonna fuck with a wicked clown?

[Verse 3: Violent J]
Now I'm in a street gang, 55 strong
Everybody singing that southwest song!
What can go wrong I mean I'm fuckin' in the haugh?
Popping that shit, I'm finna bust you in the mouth
Nobody fucks with a jokero juggalo
I don't give a fuck ya know, bitches I'm a fuck you, though
But you know the shit had to hit the fan
Some gangbanger shot me, man
Twice in the forehead, twice in the back
Twice in the eye and I'm feeling kinda wack
Stumbling along it's becoming entwined
That I'm next in line for the murder go round

[Interlude]
Hey!
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Hey!
Wicked wicked clown, wicked clown, wicked clown, dig it

[Chorus]
Murder go round, murder go round
How ya gonna fuck with a wicked clown?
Murder go round, murder go round
How ya gonna fuck with a wicked clown?

[Outro]
Hey! Hey!
Gonna get ya
(No! No! No! Not again!)
Murder go round, murder go round
How ya gonna fuck with a wicked clown?
(No, you can't fuck with the murder-go-round, G!)
Murder go round, murder go round
How ya gonna fuck with a wicked clown? (Gonna get ya)
Murder go round, murder go round
How ya gonna fuck with a wicked clown? (In the haugh)
(2 Dope's gonna get ya!)
Murder go round, murder go round
How ya gonna fuck with a wicked clown?
(Chucky Mutha-fucky! Yo, Yo!)
Murder go round, murder go round
How ya gonna fuck with a wicked clown? (Murder go round, G)
Murder go round, murder go round
How ya gonna fuck with a wicked clown? (Can't be fucked with)
Murder go round, murder go round
How ya gonna fuck with a wicked clown? (2 Dope, in the haugh)
Murder go round, murder go round
How ya gonna fuck with a wicked clown? (Can't fuck with the murder go round)
Murder go round, murder go round
How ya gonna fuck with a wicked clown? (Can't fuck with it, can't fuck with it, can't fuck with it)
Murder go round, murder go round
How ya gonna fuck with a wicked clown? (It's the murder go round, the murder go round, yo, yo)
Murder go round
