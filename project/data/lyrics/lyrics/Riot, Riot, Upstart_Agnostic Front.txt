I see right through your games
I know what´s going on
You need a desperate change
You think you´re the only one

You got no sanctuary - as far as I can see
You´ve got no power over me I disagree

Set things straight - I´m gonna set things straight
I´ve had enough
You and me are gonna set things straight
I´ve had enough

I´ve got no time for this
My life is passing by
There´s nothing that I´ll miss
It´s time to say goodbye

I´ve had enough
´cause you´re too much
I´ve had enough
You´re just too much
