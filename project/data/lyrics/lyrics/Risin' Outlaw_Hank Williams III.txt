Sittin up all night trying to have a good time singing my songs and trying to get paid
I've been roughed up beat up Ive been cut I got a tattoo at a tender age
Never could respect a sheriff trying to break my neck with a few friends and a can of mace
Born on the south side with alot of rebel pride raised alot of hell in my younger days

Hey I can't help what I say
I could be right I could be wrong
It just might hurt but it makes me strong

If the shoe fits wear it
If the truth hurts bear it
Well thats the kind of life Im living and I plan on living long
It's a hard road to choose
Being good and paying dues
But thats the kind of life Im living and I plan on living long

Running hard running free never gonna catch me driving too fast on a black top road
Loaded up hammered back I'll smack you with my tire jack you better walk away before I carry you home
Passing my pig sty sleeping where the dogs lie anywhere I go is where I call my home
Been stoned been straight been to hell and heavens gate I got thrown out when they said I didn't belong

Hey I just keep movin on
I could be right I could be wrong
It just might hurt but it makes me strong

If the shoe fits wear it
If the truth hurts bear it
Well thats the kind of life Im living and I plan on living long
It's a hard road to choose
Being good and paying dues
But thats the kind of life Im living and I plan on living long
