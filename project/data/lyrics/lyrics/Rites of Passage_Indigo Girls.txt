[Verse 1]
Galileo's head was on the block
The crime was looking up for truth
And as the bombshells of my daily fears explode
I try to trace them to my youth

[Verse 2]
And then you had to bring up reincarnation
Over a couple of beers the other night
And now I'm serving time for mistakes
Made by another in another lifetime

[Chorus]
How long 'til my soul gets it right
Can any human being ever reach that kind of light
I call on the resting soul of Galileo
King of night vision, king of insight

[Verse 3]
And then I think about my fear of motion
Which I never could explain
Some other fool across the ocean years ago
Must have crashed his little airplane

[Chorus]
How long 'til my soul gets it right
Can any human being ever reach that kind of light
I call on the resting soul of Galileo
King of night vision, king of insight

[Bridge]
I'm not making a joke, you know me
I take everything so seriously
If we wait for the time 'til all souls get it right
Then at least I know there'll be no nuclear annihilation
In my lifetime I'm still not right

[Verse 4]
I offer thanks to those before me
That's all I've got to say
Cause maybe you squandered big bucks in your lifetime
Now I have to pay
But then again it feels like some sort of inspiration
To let the next life off the hook
But she'll say "look what I had to overcome from my last life
I think I'll write a book"

[Chorus]
How long 'til my soul gets it right
Can any human being ever reach the highest light
Except for Galileoâ€”God rest his soul
Except for the resting soul of Galileo
King of night vision, king of insight

[Outro]
How long
'Til my soul gets it right
'Til we reach the highest light
How long
'Til my soul gets it right
'Til we reach the highest light
How long
