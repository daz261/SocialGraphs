[Verse 1]
Advice is cheap you can take it from me
It's yours to keep cause opinions are free
Nobody knows about the trouble I've seen
Nobody's perfect, mister, nobody's clean
It costs too much and takes too long to find out too late
Some words are not heard 'til after they're spoken
Your role was protective, your soul was too defective
Some people just don't have a heart to be broken

[Chorus]
We could have gone all the way to the Great Wall of China
If you'd only had a little more faith in me
In lieu of diamonds, gold and platinum reminders will still shine bright
All the king's men and all the king's horses
Can't put you together the way you used to be
We could have been standing on the Great Wall of China

[Verse 2]
You take a piece of whatever you touch
Too many pieces means you're touching too much
You never win if you can't play it straight
You only beat me if you get me to hate
It must be so lonely to think that you have only
Somebody else's life to live if they let you
I ain't too selective, but it don't take no detective
To find out how fast your friends will forget you

[Chorus]
We could have gone all the way to the Great Wall of China
Now all you're going to be is history
Help yourself, it's all you can eat at the Empire Diner tonight
You coulda had class, you coulda been a contender
Charlie, you shoulda looked out for me
You could have been standing, standing on the Great Wall of China

[Verse 3]
This was not your calling, just look how far you've fallen
I heard your story, man, you've got to be joking
Keep things in perspective, this is my true objective
Why tear this heart out if it's only been broken?

[Chorus]
We could have gone all the way to the Great Wall of China
If you'd only had a little more faith in me
In lieu of diamonds, gold and platinum reminders will still shine bright
All the king's men and all the king's horses
Can't put you together the way you used to be
We could have been standing on the Great Wall of China

 

[Verse 1]
Some days when I'm far away
In a lonely room in a cold seclusion
Some nights when I'm wound so tight
There is no release, there is no solution
In hell there's a big hotel
Where the bar just closed and the windows never open
No phone so you can't call home
And the TV works but the clicker is broken

[Pre-Chorus]
But in the darkness
I see your light turned on
You know my weakness
You know how I respond to

[Chorus]
Blonde over blue
Your hands are cold, your eyes are fire
Blonde over blue
They shine as though you're burning inside
One word from you
Is all I need to be inspired
Blonde over blue
I need your inspiration tonight

[Verse 2]
These days there's a million ways
To be pulled and torn, to be misdirected
These times there are sins and crimes
On the morning shows for the disconnected
I look and I write my book
And I walk away with the wrong impressions
Don't care 'cause I've done my share
And I need some time for my own obsessions

[Pre-Chorus]
It doesn't matter
I've let that life go by
It's been forgotten
'Cause all I wanted was you

[Chorus]
Blonde over blue
Your hands are cold, your eyes are fire
Blonde over blue
They shine as though you're burning inside
One word from you
Is all I need to be inspired
Blonde over blue
I need your inspiration tonight

[Verse 3]
These days not a damn soul prays
And there is no faith 'cause there's nothing to believe in
These days only good luck pays
If we don't get paid then we try to get even
I look and I write my book
And I have my say and I draw conclusions
Some nights when I'm wound so tight
There is no release, there is no solution

[Pre-Chorus]
But in the darkness
I see your light turned on
You know my weakness
You know how I respond to

[Chorus]
Blonde over blue
Your hands are cold, your eyes are fire
Blonde over blue
They shine as though you're burning inside
Blonde over blue
Your hands are cold, your eyes are fire
Blonde over blue
They shine as though you're burning inside
One word from you
Is all I need to be inspired
Blonde over blue
I need your inspiration tonight
