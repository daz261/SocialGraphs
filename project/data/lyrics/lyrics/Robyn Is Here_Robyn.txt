[Intro]
I don't think there's gonna be a change
I'm never ever gonna leave
But I hope it's gonna get better
In my heart, in my heart

[Verse 1]
Hope things will get better 'cause that's what I need
I think about the good times that we had
And now I see that you are
Living in two different places and I don't think it's gonna be a change
But I'm never gonna leave it I'm always gonna keep it In my heart

[Chorus]
In my heart
I'll keep it all together
In my heart
I know it's gonna be better
In my heart, in my heart, in my heart
I'll keep it there forever

[Verse 2]
You said that it should never be like this and
When I was a little child I never had this on my mind
But now it is like it is and I don't think it's gonna be a change
But I'm never gonna leave it I'm always gonna keep it In my heart

[Chorus]
In my heart
I'll keep it all together
In my heart
I know it's gonna be better
In my heart, in my heart, in my heart
I'll keep it there forever
In my heart
I'll keep it all together
In my heart
I know it's gonna be better
In my heart, in my heart, in my heart
I'll keep it there forever
