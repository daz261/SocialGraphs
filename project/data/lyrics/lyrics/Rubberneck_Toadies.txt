[Verse 1]
Bended knee
Nine years old
Waiting for
Just one word

[Verse 2]
I was thinkin' of all the things
My daddy told me of
Sin and salvation and
Manhood and dignity

[Verse 3]
All that time
In the dark
Just one word
Backslider

[Bridge]
I remember the day I stepped
Into the water
My daddy held me in his hands
And pushed my head under
And said

[Verse 4]
Son, I am
So proud
Just one word
Backslider
Backslider
Backslider

[Verse 5]
Well, I opened my eyes
As my daddy held me in his hands
I looked up through the water
And I thought I saw Jesus and then
Yeah

[Verse 6]
Well, I threw up my hands
And I heard "Amen"
And I prayed, "Sweet Jesus
Don't let me become a backslider"
Backslider
Backslider
Backslider
Yeah
