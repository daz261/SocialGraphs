Everything is good these days
But all of my friends are dying
Davy may and Lisa may
But nobody else really wants to stay
Nobody else really wants to stay

I said
Open the door
Open the door I can't stay here anymore
Open the door
Open the door

Candle light the streets at night
Thinking you're wrong but you know that you're right
Thinking you're wrong but you know you're alright

I said
Open the door
Open the door I can't stay here anymore
Open the door
Open the door

Everything is good these days
But all of my friends are dying
Careful when you say goodbye
Careful stays and careless dies
But careless is and careful tries

Open the door
Open the door I can't stay here anymore
Open the door
Open the door

Open the door
Open the door I can't stay here anymore
Open the door
Open the door
