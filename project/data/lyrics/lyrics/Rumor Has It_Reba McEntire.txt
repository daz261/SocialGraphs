[Verse 1]
I overheard a conversation, your name was mentioned in
But they didn't talk about us, only her again
I didn't want to listen, but I hung on every word
They said some things I wish I hadn't heard

[Chorus]
Rumor has it, she has you
Rumor has it, you love her too
Talk is cheap but the price is high when it's true
Rumor has it, she has you

[Verse 2]
This town's so small, a whisper can be heard a mile away
And people here will gossip when there's nothing else to say
I wouldn't have believed my ears, but I see it in your eyes
The stories going around this town aren't lies

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Whoa! Rumor has it she loves you
