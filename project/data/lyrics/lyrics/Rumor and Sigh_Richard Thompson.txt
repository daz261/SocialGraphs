[Verse 1]
I feel so good I'm gonna break somebody's heart tonight
I feel so good I'm gonna take someone apart tonight

They put me in jail for my deviant ways
Two years seven months and sixteen days
Now I'm back on the street in a purple haze

[Chorus]
And I feel so good
And I feel so good
Well I feel so good I'm gonna break somebody's heart tonight

[Verse 2]
I feel so good I'm gonna make somebody's day tonight
I feel so good I'm gonna make somebody pay tonight

I'm old enough to sin but I'm too young to vote
Society been dragging on the tail of my coat
Now I've got a suitcase full of fifty pound notes
And a half-naked woman with her tongue down my throat

[Chorus]
And I feel so good
And I feel so good
Well I feel so good I'm gonna break somebody's heart tonight

[Bridge]
They made me pay for the things I've done
Now it's my turn to have all the fun
Well I feel so good I'm gonna break somebody's heart tonight

[Outro Chorus]
And I feel so good
I feel so good
Well I feel so good I'm gonna break somebody's heart tonight
Oh Oh Oh
I feel so good I'm gonna break somebody's heart tonight
Mmm break somebody's heart
Break somebody's heart
Mmm break somebody's heart
Ooh break somebody's heart

 

She said "Darling I'm in love with your mind
The way you care for me, it's so kind
Love to see you again, I wish I had more time"

She was laughing as she brushed my cheek
"Why don't you call me, angel, maybe next week
Promise now, cross your heart and hope to die"

But I misunderstood, but I misunderstood, but I misunderstood
I thought she was saying good luck, she was saying good bye
But I misunderstood, but I misunderstood, but I misunderstood
I thought she was saying good luck, she was saying good bye

Things I tried to put shine in her eyes
Wire wheels and shimmering things
Wild nights when the whole world seemed to fly

She said "The thing that's so unique
When we're together we don't have to speak
We'll always be such good friends, you and I"

Oh but I misunderstood, but I misunderstood, but I misunderstood
I thought she was saying good luck, she was saying good bye
But I misunderstood, but I misunderstood, but I misunderstood
I thought she was saying good luck, she was saying good
I thought she was saying good luck, she was saying good
I thought she was saying good luck, she was saying goodbye
