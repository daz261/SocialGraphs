[Verse 1]
Dum deedle dee dum dum
Little girl, where did you come from?
You fine little thing, you make my heart sing
Come on baby, let me buy the wedding ring

[Verse 2]
Baby you drive me crazy
Drive my poor heart hazy
You got my senses reelin', oh baby, what a feelin'
Come on, baby, let me make love to you

[Chorus]
She said, "Yeah"
She said, "Yeah"
She said, "Yeah, yeah, yeah
Come on, baby, I wanna make love to you too"

[Verse 3]
You know I got the feelin'
In my soul
I know I love ya, no one above ya
Come on, baby, just let me love you

[Chorus]
"Yeah"
She said, "Yeah"
She said, "Yeah, yeah, yeah
Come on, baby, I wanna make love to you too"

My love you've been saving
You see my miss, I wanna kiss
Come on, baby, don't treat me like this

[Chorus]
She said, "Yeah"
She said, "Yeah"
She said, "Yeah, yeah, yeah
Come on, baby, I wanna make love to you too"

"Yeah"
