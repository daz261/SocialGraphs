Hold my thoughts I'm at an impasse
Past the place I stopped before
The sweeper's sweeping fragments
Of my head out the door

And the ice it burns upon my forehead
The calmness starts to scream
Must I always hold the upright
When my soul longs to dream

Chorus
Is it too much to find an answer
Is it too much to hold you close
Is it too much to find a reason
Is it too much to free my soul
From self control

I can't get it any better
I always end up killing time
Time for love and time for living
Time to find what's really mine

Chorus Twice

And I know you're always waiting for me
You take me far away
And I know you're holding me
And it's better now . . 
And it's better now . . 
And it's better now . .
