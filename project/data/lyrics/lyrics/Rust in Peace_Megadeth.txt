[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
Bestow upon me knowledge
Wizard, all-knowing, all-wise
I want to rule this kingdom
Make sweet the breeze, now defiled
Dethrone the evil prince's iron fists
In velvet gloves of sin
Parade the grey-robed monks
The vestal virgins wheel the wyvern's in

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2]
Let the ceremony consecrate the marriage
Let me be the protégé of five magics
Give me alchemy, give me wizardry
Give me sorcery, thermatology
Electricity, magic if you please
Master all of these, bring him to his knees

[Bridge]
I master five magics
I master five magics
I master five magics
I master five magics

[Verse 3]
Possessed with Hellish torment (Possessed with Hellish torment)
I master magics "five" (I master magics "five")
Hunting the abyss lord (Hunting the abyss lord)
Only one will stay alive (Only one will stay alive)
He who lives by the sword (He who lives by the sword)
Will surely also die (Will surely also die)
He who lives in sin (He who lives in sin)
Will surely live the lie

[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
I miss the warm embrace I felt
First time you touched me
Secure and safe in open arms
I should have known you'd crush me
A snake you were when we met
I loved you anyway
Pulling out your poison fangs
The venom never goes away
Serpent swims free in my blood
Dragons sleeping in my veins
Jackyl speaking with my tongue
Roach egg laying in my brain

[Verse 2]
Once stalked beneath your shadow
Sleepwalking to the gallows
I'm the sun that beats your brow in
'Til I finally threw the towel in
Never knowing if I'd wake up
In a whirlpool, got redundant
My brain was just some driftwood
In a cesspool, I became dead
From a rockstar to a desk fool
Was my destiny, someone said
Love's a tide pool
Taste the water, life's abundant
Taste me!

[Instrumental Outro]
