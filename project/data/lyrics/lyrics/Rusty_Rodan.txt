The rain had a sound
It's blinded everything
Coming down, coming down
The rain had a sound
It flattened its face on the window frame
And I thought we were safe, so safe
My soul sank down
Down in the bed
Your hair spread out on the pillow
In the black fan
I buried my face
I traded you, I traded you
I traded you

Let's be quiet a while
Pull down the shades
Take off your jeans
Lay on the bed
Please, it's easy, it's easy
You don't have to do anything
I'll get a towel
Close your eyes
This is my sound
This is your sound
Open your mouth
Please
Cover your eyes
Cover your body
You can trust it, you can trust it
Put away your money under your shirt
You can trust it
Jesus
You don't have to do anything
You can trust it
This is your sound

The train had a sound
On the edge of town moving around
It never rusts, it never sleeps
It's rusted, rusted
It's rusted, coming
Incoming, incoming
Everything changes
Everything changes
Everything changes

Outside it's loud
It rattles the windows
Bus shakes the bed
The clock's unwound
Stripped, stripped down
Darker in here, darker
Cover your ears
I give you my hands
Cover my body
You don't have to say anything
You don't have to make this anything
I'm nothing
I'm poison
Everything changes
I'm nothing
Just make the sound
Beg for something better
Everything changes
Pray for something better
Everything changes
Beg for something better
Everything changes
Pray for something better
Everything changes

I'll give you my hands
I'll cover my body
I'll give you my poison
I'll open my body for you to
Come on come on come
Come on come on come
Come on come on
When you fly you'll fall into me
Fall into me, fall
Come on come on come
Come on come on come
Come on come on
When you fly you'll fall into me
Fall into me, fall

Open, uncovered
Too drowned to speak
Too brilliant to see
Do you see it
Do you hear it
It's lifeless
This is your sound
This is my shame
On our knees
You were lying, lying
We were laying against the door
Under the lights, nervous
You were lying on the bathroom floor
You were sick, so sick
Sick, so sick, so sick, so sick
Sick, so sick, so sick, so sick
Sick, so sick, so sick, so sick

The bodies sleeping somewhere
Mouths upturned into the air
Turning over another page each night
We wait, wait for something better
Wait for something better
Wait for something better to come
Come on come on come
Come on come on come
Come on come on
When you fly you'll fall into me
Fall into me, fall
Come on come on come
Come on come on come
Come on come on
When you fly you'll fall into me
Fall into me, fall into me, fall into me, fall in to me
Fall into me, fall into me, fall into me, fall in to me

Everything, everything
Everything, you're on everything
[?]
The window is open
The bed is empty
The drawer is half open
The clock's unwound
We make the sound
We make the sound
We make the sound of air escaping
Escaping something, everything
Everything's undone
Your shirt
My body is undone
Everything, everything changes

Bus shakes the bed
The shakes make the sound
Through the crack in the door
Through the holes in the floor
Shakes make the sound
Bus shakes the bed
Through the hole in the floor
Through the crack in the door
The shutters are down
The light is a threat
With every breath you take
We're safe and I'm undone
And I'm undone
Closer, closer
I will not take
More
I will not take
More
I will not... take
I will be there, I will be there
I swear
I will be there, I will be there
I swear
I will be there, swear, I will be there, swear
I will be there, swear
I will be there, I will be there
I swear, I swear
I will be there, swear, I will be there, swear
I will be there, swear
I will be there, I will be there
I will not take more of what's been taken for you
Swear
