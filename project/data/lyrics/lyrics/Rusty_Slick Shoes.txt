What they say never really mattered to me
I've been wrong
Open the door, time to move on
What has changed?
Same old story with a new name
I'm not scared, I've been here before
I guess I thought you'de be there, I swear it
This is the last time that I close my eyes to it
Never again will we be what we were
Maybe I'll just walk away
Time thrown away, I didn't use it anyway
Been here for so long, now it's time to move on
Read between the lines, I can't make up my mind
Was this what we planned?
Mercury falls, forgot how much I hate the fall
Still sitting by the phone, I hope that you don't call
It's alright now we'll make it somehow
You'd think we'd learned by now
Well, I guess it goes to show
Youre the answer to all my prayers, I swear it
This is the last time that I close my eyes to it
Never again will we be what we were
Maybe I'll just walk away
