[Intro]
I'm born, I'm alive
I breathe, in a moment or two I realize
That the sphere upon which I reside
Is asleep on its feet
Should I go back to sleep?

[Verse 1]
I'm born, I'm alive
I breathe, in a moment or two I realize
That the sphere upon which I reside
Is asleep on its feet
Should I, should I, should I go back to sleep?

[Chorus]
You stare at me like I'm a vitamin
On the surface you hate, but you know you need me
I come dressed as any pill you deem fit
Whatever helps you swallow truth all the more easily

[Verse 2]
We orbit the sun, I grow up
My open eyes see a zombified, somnambulist society
Leaving us as vitamins for the hibernating human animal
Do you, do you, do you see what I mean?

[Chorus]
You stare at me like a vitamin
On the surface you hate, but you know you want me
I come dressed as any pill you deem fit
Whatever helps you swallow truth all the more easily

[Bridge]
And I wonder, will you digest me?

[Verse 3]
Into the sleep machine I won't plug in
In fact I'd rather die before I will comply
To you, my friend I write the reason I still live
Because in my mind it's set the vitamin is ripe to give
Coming closer to another two thousand years
You and I will pry the closed eye of the sleep machine

[Chorus]
You stare at me like a vitamin
On the surface you hate, but you know you want me
I come dressed as any pill you deem fit
Whatever helps you swallow truth all the more easily

 

[Verse 1]
At first I see an open wound
Infected and disastrous
It breathes chaotic catastrophe
It cries to be renewed (Please renew me!)
Its tears are the color of anger
They dry to form a scab
To the touch, its stiff and resilient
Underneath, the new skin breathes, yeah

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
It's all been saved
With the exception for the right parts
But when will we be new skin?

[Verse 2]
As outwardly cliche as it may seem
Yes, something under the surface says "c'est la vie"
There is a circle, it is a plan
Dead skin will atrophy itself to start again
Look closely at the open wound
See past what covers the surface
Underneath chaotic catastrophe
Creation takes the stage, so
Dead skin will atrophy itself to start again
Dead skin will atrophy itself to start again
Dead skin will atrophy itself to start again

[Chorus]
It's all been saved
With the exception for the right parts
But when will we be new skin?
It's all been seen
With the exception for what could be
But when will we be new skin?

[Sample over a Guitar Solo]
Until the twentieth century, reality was everything humans could touch, smell, see, and hear. Since the initial publication of the chart of electromagnetic spectrum, humans have learned that what they can touch, smell, see, and hear is less than one millionth of reality.

[Bridge]
Fallacious cognitions
Spewed from televisions
Do mold our decisions
So stop and take a look and you'll see what I see now
Now!

[Chorus]
It's all been saved
With the exception for the right parts
But when will we be new skin?
It's all been seen
With the exception for what could be
But when will we be new skin?
Skin
