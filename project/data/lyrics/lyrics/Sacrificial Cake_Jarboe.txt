Obey the strange-haired woman
Her sad, singing lips
A child of pleasure, unbound
Her bud and bloom
Are tortured execution
In the valley of innocence
Purgatory's caress

A ritual awakening
Transport transformation in
Her altar of temptation
Taste of bliss, enunciation

Treasure, book and temple
Eternal idol mystica
Transcendental satisfaction
The sweet meat
Love and holy cult

Ravished demons speak in tongues
Soak emotion dogs, the otherworld
Overwhelm corruption, love
Lost in the labyrinth, revelation
Lost in the labyrinth, thunderbolt sensation
Cabalistic kiss, electric spectre
Sleepwalker, dream hunter
Nightmare tempest
Discharge aurage and please my mind
We reap the fruit, or calling the vultures
A terrible joy, transmit
Her
