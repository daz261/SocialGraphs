[Verse 1]
Maybe just because I was newly washed like Brandon Walsh
You took notice of me
You thought I was a rockstar, some gangster or a bowling star
I don't believe you babe

[Chorus]
But you, you're not the only one
Who think I am a Chiquita dude
You're not the only one
Well I'm afraid I'm not that rude

[Verse 2]
I took you to the A-house and even to the punkpalats
Those trips made you throw up
And after a few nights you took off to the holm of asps
That's where you belong

[Chorus]
But you, you're not the only one
Who think I am a Chiquita dude
You're not the only one
Well I'm afraid I'm not that rude
You're not the only one
Who think I am a Chiquita dude
You're not the only one
Well I'm afraid I'm not that rude

[Verse 3]
When it comes to you it's hard to have a open mind
So I just have one advice
Say ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba

[Chorus]
But you, you're not the only one
Who think I am a Chiquita dude
You're not the only one
Well I'm afraid I'm not that rude
You're not the only one
Who think I am a Chiquita dude
You're not the only one
Well I'm afraid I'm not that rude, yeah, yeah

[Bridge]
Walt Jabsco, Walt Jabsco
Now that's what I call rude
Walt Jabsco, Walt Jabsco
He's the man he's a super dude

[Chorus]
Because you, you're not the only one
Who think I am a Chiquita dude
You're not the only one
Well I'm afraid I'm not that rude

[Outro]
Well, I'm not your Chiquita dude

 

[Verse 1]
Puffin' again, so happy with his friends
He can dance even in his car
Straight guys should know
Whatever's on his mind
He's got a reason, oh, he's got a reason
He's got a reason for every season
Scared to be smart
So far he's everything, if you're laughing he's laughing too
Just don't let him begin
'Cause in the end he'll win
He's got a reason, oh, he's got a reason
He's got a reason, yeah

[Chorus]
Hole in his head, you always tried to never be lied to
Now you understand, he's not your friend
High class my ass, you always tried to never be lied to
Now you understand, you have to seek someone else
With another reason, with another reason to be drinking
Drink!

[Verse 2]
Dreamin' again
But he's not asleep his eyes are open starin' at you
Reads your mind trough his pipe
And then he tells you that
He's got a reason, oh, he's got a reason
He's got a reason for every season
Impressive you guess
He couldn't show you less
Still you're snowbored like the Funky Bros
Life must go on and this is just a story
I've got a reason, always got a reason
I've got a reason, yeah

[Chorus]
Hole in his head, you always tried to never be lied to
Now you understand, he's not your friend
High class my ass, you always tried to never be lied to
Now you understand, you have to seek someone else

[Post-Chorus]
What's wrong with someone owerweight
Big surprise, he's coming after you with a reason
Always with a reason
With a reason, take it, take a reason my ass

[Bridge]
He's got a reason, always got a reason
He's got a reason, always got a reason
He's got a reason, always got a reason
He's got a reason, always got a reason
He's got a reason, always got a reason
He's got a reason, always got a reason
He's got a reason, always got a reason
He's got a reason, always got a reason

[Chorus]
Hole in his head, you always tried to never be lied to
Now you understand, he's not your friend
High class my ass, you always tried to never be lied to
Now you understand, you have to seek someone else
Do it!
