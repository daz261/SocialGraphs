[Verse 1]
In beautiful houses with beautiful gardens
And beautiful friends inside
And I stand all alone that rain falling down
I stare at your window and I cry

[Chorus]
I love you so much
I love you too much
I love you so much, so much
Will you be mine?

[Verse 2]
In beautiful houses with beautiful gardens
Where beautiful dreams have died
And you stand all alone with your friends all around
And you stare at your window and you cry

[Chorus]
I love you so much
I love you too much
I love you so much, so much
Will you be mine?

[Bridge]
And I'm sorry for the things I said
Sorry for the things I did
Sorry for the way I said goodbye

I'm sorry for the things I said
Sorry for the things I did
Sorry that I ever made you cry

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 4]
Well in beautiful houses with beautiful gardens
And beautiful friends inside
And I stand all alone with my world falling down
And I stare at your window and I cry

[Chorus]
I love you so much
I love you too much
I love you so much, so much
Will you be mine?
I love you so much, so much
Will you be mine?

[Guitar Solo]
Oh darling
