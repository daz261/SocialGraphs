What makes you think everything in this world
That you have can be taken away?
In the world this day, it's kill or be killed
I live each day like it might be my last
In this lifetime, few things are worth fighting for
My blood, your honor
Everyone has a destiny
I'll choose my own

I will not be a victim
I'll choose my own
My cries won't go unheard
I'll choose my own
I got to fight (fight) for myself
I'll choose my own
And by my own control, destiny

I'll choose my own destiny
And I'll never let anyone take away what I hold so true
I won't live in denial
And I won't turn the other cheek
I must remain convicted and never accept this suffering
I've learned from my mistakes
And made a promise to myself
I won't live in the past
I won't live in the past

I've been affected by your lies
And I've let them hold me back
I wasn't thinking for myself
I wasn't living for myself

I will not be a victim
I'll choose my own
My cries won't go unheard
I'll choose my own
I got to fight (fight) for myself
I'll choose my own
And by my own control

What I have in my heart
What I have in my heart
I'll take to my grave
I'll take to my grave
