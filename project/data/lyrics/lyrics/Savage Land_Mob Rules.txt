After mankind threw itself into filth and ashes
And all life on earth went down
Mighty storms and rain and thunderbolt that crashes
Washed away all sins around

Just the good survived
Saved their naked life from darkness
No one bad survived
Swept away - Insurgeria

When the caravan resumed their trip to green land
They expected the fight to go on
They had to pass a lot of life's examinations
Before they reached the land of the free

Just the best survived
Saved their naked life from darkness
No one weak survived
To forget Insurgeria

All the people, men and women, forty children
Stood together side by side
They came to learn the rules of hope and independence
And taught each child how to survive

Did not all survive
Saved just most of life from darkness
The last born survived
And forgot Insurgeria

 

Strange desire burning in my head
Taste of future, keep it secret till you're dead
Endless sorrow, tell the tales of time
Think of the future don't regret the unknown sign

That's over when the cold wind blows
Right there where the almighty power grows

When the war is over now
Then they all stand up
And rain comes down
Holy smoke and water falls
And signs of future life

Same old story - same old fate
Script of mankind is the script of war and hate
After darkness when the sun returns
Think of the future, don't regret and try to learn

That's over when the cold wind blows
Right there where the almighty power grows

When the war is over now
Then they all stand up
And rain comes down
Holy smoke and water falls
And signs of future life
