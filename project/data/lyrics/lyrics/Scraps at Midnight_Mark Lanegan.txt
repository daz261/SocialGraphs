From the dive down to the wet
Usually I fall, tell myself
It doesn't matter anyway
That this is just another day

I don't speak the truth too much
Hear the roars and the hush
And the cold chill of time
And I'm happy murderin' my mind

Oh I remember your voice
Turnin' around and around and around in my head
Now it's just like you said
Everything inside is dead

From the pillar to the post
I kill what I can miss the most
Of the blame when you get in touch
Another town, another torch

Thought I saw you in a dream
Fill the hours in between
When I call myself alone
Then I disappear below

I remember your face
But it's been a long been a long been a long long day
What I did along the way
Well, I wouldn't care to say
