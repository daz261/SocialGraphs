Maggots infest the minds of unbelievers
In the form of unholiness
Deception they feast upon while unaware
Of the death that will take place

Undead stalk the earth with anticipation
Of impending release from suffering
Their rejection of the creator of all
Will prevent this from ever happening

Heed the words that terminate damnation
Terminate damnation

Escape from torment is discovered
Through blood from veins ripped apart
By warriors under a governor's hand
Unaware, while tearing satan's heart

One thing remains for mankind
To be spared from eternal darkness
Become mortified to ways unclean
And please the will of His Holiness

Transformations to immortality is at hand
Through the expiry of self-will
The flesh will be consumed in time
Birthing restoration to the soul

Divine regurgitation of impurity
Separation of wheat from chaff
Chaff being Godlessness, becomes extinct
Through inevitable destiny of damnation

The ostentatiousness of satan
Has descended to the burial ground
Maggots accumulate in his tomb
Worms are a covering for his corpse

Damned, slain bodies lying motionless
With festering gaping wounds from the sword
Bury this disgusting ancient beast of old
Forever eternal without escape

Heed the words that terminate damnation
Terminate damnation

Escape from torment is discovered
Through blood from veins ripped apart
By warriors under a governor's hand
Unaware while tearing satan's heart

One thing remains for mankind
To be spared from eternal darkness
Become mortified to ways unclean
And please the will of His Holiness
