[Verse 1]
Peaceful confrontation, meet war machine
Seizing all civil liberties
Honest ballotation among banshee
Spilling blood on humanity

[Chorus 1]
You cannot hide the face of death
Oppression ruled by bloodshed
No disguise can deface evil
The massacre of innocent people

[Verse 2]
Deviated lies, fear blinds your eyes
Enforcing their truth through a gun
Aggressive discipline and barbaric control
Thousands of people cannot be wrong

[Chorus 2]
You cannot hide the face of death
Oppression ruled by bloodshed
No disguise can deface evil
Stains the primitive sickle
Blood red

[Lead – King and Hanneman]

[Verse 3]
Growing opposition with words as ammunition
Expressions of life's liberties
Aggressive discipline and barbaric control
Spilling blood throughout humanity

[Chorus 2]
You cannot hide the face of death
Oppression ruled by bloodshed
No disguise can deface evil
Stains the primitive sickle
Blood red

 

[Verse 1]
Welcome to my world
Involve yourself within my dream
Experience a life
Just like your mind thought not to be
Take a look through time
At past or present worlds to be
I rule this inferno
Enthroned for eternity

[Chorus]
Coils of the serpent unwind
Buried beneath, you will find
Deep in the halls of the damned
Spirit in black till the end

[Verse 2]
Spirits damned to rot
Amidst the brimstone-fire wall
Eyes of the dead
Watching from their living hall
Broken-glass reflections
Show your flesh eaten away
Beyond the gates, I'll take you
Where the blood forever rains

[Chorus]
Coils of the serpent unwind
Buried beneath, you will find
Deep in the halls of the damned
Spirit in black till the end

[Lead – Hanneman]

[Chorus]
Coils of the serpent unwind
Buried beneath, you will find
Deep in the halls of the damned
Spirit in black till the end

[Verse 3]
Afterlife confessions
Tell me who you used to be
Looking on in wonder
As I show you it was me
Burning from within
You know one spark is all it takes
Hear the piercing cries of all
Who found that hell awaits

[Verse 4]
Living nightmare, can't you see?
You really have no choice
Faded memories haunt you
Listen closely to my voice
Feed me all your hatred
Empty all your thoughts to me
I can fill your emptiness
With immortality

[Lead – King]

[Verse 1]
Welcome to my world
Involve yourself within my dream
Experience a life
Just like your mind thought not to be
Take a look through time
At past or present worlds to be
I rule this inferno
Enthroned for eternity

 

[Verse 1]
Gun down cold on a raw deal
Home turf, my battlefield
In no one's way, caught in a crossfire
Stray bullets can kill

[Chorus]
Expendable youth
Fighting for possession
Having control...
A principal obsession
Rivalry and retribution
Death: the only solution

[Verse 2]
Injured soul on the hard ground
Head blown off, facedown
Lying in a pool of blood
An accidental death, homicide

[Chorus]
Expendable youth
Fighting for possession
Having control...
A principal obsession
Rivalry and retribution
Death: the only solution

Fighting you motherfuckers

[Lead – Hanneman and King]

[Bridge]
Struggling to survive
This drug-induced warfare
Having control...
A principal obsession
Expendable youth...
Fighting for possession
Violence is only a friend

[Chorus]
Expendable youth
Fighting for possession
Having control
A principal obsession
Rivalry and retribution
Death: the only solution

 

[Intro]
How I've waited for you to come
I've been here all alone
Now that you've arrived
Please stay awhile
And I promise I won't keep you long
I'll keep you forever (forever, forever, forever)

[Verse 1]
Graze the skin with my fingertips
The brush of dead, cold flesh appease the means
Provoking images, delicate features so smooth
A pleasant fragrance in the light of the moon

[Chorus]
Dance with the dead in my dreams
Listen to their hallowed screams
The dead have taken my soul
Temptation's lost all control

[Verse 2]
Simple smiles elude psychotic eyes
Lose all mind control, rationale declines
Empty eyes enslave the creations
Of placid faces and lifeless pageants

[Bridge]
In the depths of a mind insane
Fantasy and reality are the same

[Lead - King and Hanneman]

[Verse 3]
Graze the skin with my fingertips
The brush of dead, warm flesh pacifies the means
Incised members ornaments on my being
Adulating the skin before me

[Verse 2]
Simple smiles elude psychotic eyes
Lose all mind control, rationale declines
Empty eyes enslave the creations
Of placid faces and lifeless pageants

[Chorus]
Dance with the dead in my dreams (Hello? Hello, Mr. Gein?)
Listen to their hallowed screams (Mr. Gein?)
The dead have taken my soul (Let me out of here, Mr. Gein)
Temptation's lost all control (Mr. Gein? I don't want to play anymore, Mr. Gein)
Dance with the dead in my dreams (Mr. Gein, this isn't fun anymore)
Listen to their hallowed screams (I don't wanna play anymore, Mr. Gein)
The dead have taken my soul (Mr. Gein? I want out of here, Mr. Gein)
Temptation's lost all control (Let me out now)
