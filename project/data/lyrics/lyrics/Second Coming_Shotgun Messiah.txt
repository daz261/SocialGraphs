Hits me when I'm all alone
Hits me in a crowd
Feel it rippin' thru my bones
Makes me cry out loud

New crime of passion
This is what I crave, waiting for the wave
Love/hate obsession

[Chorus]
Red hot
Makes me wanna cry but I like it
Red hot
Making me so high that I like it
Red hot
Makes me wanna die but I like it
Red hot
Makes me feel red hot

Nothin' pumpin' in my veins
Nothin' I regret
Nothin' pleasure, nothin' pain
Ain't seen nothin' yet

New crime of passion
This is what I crave, waiting for the wave
Love/hate obsession

[Chorus]

I gotta take some time
Clear my fuckin' mind
Pull the plug, erase, rewind
See what's left behind

A blackened sheep, digging deep
Anything's up for keeps
Loved, adored, admired
Fuck you all, I'm tired

New crime of passion
This is what I crave, waiting for the wave
Love/hate obsession
This is what I need, give until you bleed

[Chorus]
