Driving south round midnight, man I must have been insane
Driving south round midnight in a howling hurricane
I stopped for an old man hitcher at a lonely old crossroad
He said, 'I'm going nowhere
And I'm only here to see if I can steal your soul'
'I'm not tryin' to make you, I don't want to touch your skin
I know all there is to know about you and all your sins
Well, you ain't too young or pretty and you sure as hell can't sing
Any time you want to sell your soul
I've got a toll-free number you can ring'

Yeah, that's what I thought he said anyway

'I'm not tryin' to make you, I don't want to touch your skin
I know all there is to know about you and all your sins
Well, you ain't too young or pretty and you sure as hell can't sing
Any time you want to sell your soul
I've got a toll-free number you can ring'

'Oh-eight-oh-oh-triple-six-oh, yeah
Oh-eight-oh-oh-triple-six-oh, yeah'

I stopped for an old man hitcher at a lonely old crossroad
He said, 'I'm going nowhere
And I'm only here to see if I can steal your soul'

 

[Verse 1]
When your heart is black and broken
And you need a helping hand
When you're so much in love
You don't know just how much you can stand

When your questions go unanswered
And the silence is killing you
Take my hand baby I'm your man
I got loving enough for two

[Chorus]
Ten storey love song
I built this thing for you
Who can take you higher than twin peak mountain blue?
Oh well, I built this thing for you
And I love you true

[Verse 2]
There's no sure-fire set solutions
No shortcut through the trees
No breaching the wall that they put there to keep you from me

As you're lying awake in this darkness
This everlasting night
Some day soon don't know where or when
You're gonna wake up and see the light

[Chorus]
Ten storey love song
I built this thing for you
Who can take you higher than twin peak mountain blue?
Oh well, I built this thing for you
And I love you true

[Chorus]
Ten storey love song
I built this thing for you
Who can take you higher than twin peak mountain blue?
Oh well, I built this thing for you
And I love you true
