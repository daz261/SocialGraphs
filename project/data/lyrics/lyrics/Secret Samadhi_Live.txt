People should not be afraid
We came to the earth to graze
No shortcuts to the face, this means you
A child gives you his shoes

People should not be afraid
We came to the earth to graze
If it slithers into the haze
It can't be true
A child gives you his shoes

In the early morning, cut her down
The pill, she needs your love
Forget your mother and your father
They aren't important son

We came to the earth to graze
Everyone's diggin' in
Now there's no time to live
Live

People should not be afraid
The artist does figure eights
But will it stand the test of time
Or will it rot
Like the mission that tried too hard

In the early morning, cut her down
The pill, she needs your love
Forget your mother and your father
You'll fall apart inside

We came to the earth to graze
Everyone's diggin' in
Now there's no time to live
Live

We came to the earth to graze
Everyone's diggin' in
Now there's no time to live
Live

(SOLO)

In the early morning, cut her down
She really needs your love
Forget your mother and your father
You'll fall apart inside

We came to the earth to graze
Everyone's diggin' in
Now there's no time to live
Live
