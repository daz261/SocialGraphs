Can you see me going down
I am screaming out loud
And the fear of god is in me now
Dissolve
In the moonshine
I leave no trace
My visions have gone
Far away from this place
They've dissolved
Can you see me going down
I am screaming out loud
And the fear of god is in me now
Dissolve
Dissolve
Dissolve

 

Slowly she moves underground
Far below is where she is found
Quickly now she's moving up
Seed of need it will erupt

Something is happening
Underneath the ground
For she's been waiting to bloom

Thinking and wondering
Of her climb up to the sun
For she's been waiting to bloom

Waiting for her
Thinking now she can't ever get in
Dizzy now from the earth and its spin
Forcing her she must give up
Seed of need it will erupt

Waking so sweetly
The earth she has outgrown
For she's been waiting to bloom

Stretching she's growing
Her time has just begun
For she's been waiting to bloom
Waiting for her

Let me grow
The soil, it strangles me
Let me grow
The soil, it strangles me

Something is happening
Underneath the ground
For she's been waiting to bloom

Thinking and wondering
Of her climb up to the sun
For she's been waiting to bloom
Waiting to bloom
