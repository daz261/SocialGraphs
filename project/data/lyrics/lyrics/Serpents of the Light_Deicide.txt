Bastard of the cross relentlessly
Strike fear preaching of his coming here
Scriptures, twisted words to provocate
Rapture from the lord your god so great

BASTARDS OF CHRIST - DIE!!!!

He fucked himself to save you - put to death, masochist
For this his word berate truth - agonized, prophecized
Revive the book of fiction - blasphemy, gluttony, to deceive you and me
In battled disposition - hang the bitch on the cross
Entitle his convictions - blasphemous, lunatic
Your heart is full of hatred - BASTARDS DIE
FUCK YOUR CHRIST, WILL SURVIVE
KILL YOURSELF........DIE!!!!!!!!!!

Bastard, for your god you compromise
Do without, search the truth you'll never find
Scriptures offer little to relate
Laughter from the lord into your face

BASTARDS OF CHRIST - DIE!!!!

You think your god will save who - I will see, just believe
You fool, not true, no thank you - enemy of the cross
His word installs deception - pray to god, not for me
For yourself, soon you'll see
You'll die for your religion - holy shit, pacifist
Untrue with choices given - nothing won, you are dead
Describe the holy vision - BLACKING OUT, FINAL BREATH
MEET WITH DEATH
NOTHINGNESS, DIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
