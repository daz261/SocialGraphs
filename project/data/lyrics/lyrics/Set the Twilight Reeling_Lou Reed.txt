It can only lead to trouble if you break my heart
If you accidentally crush it on the ides of March
I'd prefer you were straight forward
You don't have to go through all of that
I'm a New York city man, baby, and say "go" and that is that

New York city man, you just say "go" and that is that
I'm a New York city man, you just say "go" and that is that

It's far too complicated to make up a lie
That you'd have to remember and really why
I wouldn't want to be around you
If you didn't want to have me around
I'm a M-A-N-N man, you blink your eyes and I'll be gone

M-A-N-N man, you blink your eyes, honey, I love you, I'll be gone
New York city man, you blink your eyes and I'll be gone

Brutus made a pretty speech but Caesar was betrayed
Lady Macbeth went crazy but Macbeth ended slain
Ophelia and Desdamona dead leaving Hamlet in a play
But I'm no Lear with blinded eyes, say "go" and I am gone

The stars have shut their eyes up tight
The earth has changed it's course
A Kingdom sits on a black knight's back
As he tries to mount a white jeweled horse
While a clock full of butterflies on the hour
Releases a thousand moths
You say "leave" and I'll be gone
Without any remorse
No letters faxes phones or tears
There's a difference between bad and worse

I'm a New York city man, blink your eyes and I'll be gone
New York city - man, M-A-N, you blink your eyes and I'll be gone

New York city, I love you, New York city man
New York city, how I love you, blink your eyes and I'll be gone
Just a little grain of sand
New York city, ooohhh, how I love you
New York city, baby, blink your eyes and I'll be gone
Oh, how I love you

 

Wind blows snow outside my windows
Crowd below runs wild in the streets
Two rented brothers race down two separate alleys
Heading for the finish line

Down in the train yard out by the stockyard
Butchers with aprons hack meat in the snow
Blood has the brothers pulsing with envy
Heading for the finish line

Two rented brothers. Their faces keep changing
Just like these feelings I have for you
And nothing's forever not even five minutes
When you're headed for the finish line

Down in the depot out by the meat rack
Down by the tunnels surrounding the jail
Prisoners are marching in squares and in circles
They're heading for the finish line

They're lining up for Noah's Ark
They're stabbing each other in the dark
Saluting a flag made of some rich guy's socks
Heading for the finish line

Close to the line the ice is cracking
Two rented feelings sitting in the stands
Two mothers, two fathers and both of them are paid for
All of a sudden it comes back to me

Just up ahead is the finish line
Two rented referees and two checkered rags
Out of the corner of my eye comes a dark horse with black wings
Headed for the finish line

I'm five years old the room is fuzzy
I think there's also a very young girl
It's hard to remember what happened exactly
As I'm staring at the finish line
First came fire then came light
Then came feeling then cane sight
