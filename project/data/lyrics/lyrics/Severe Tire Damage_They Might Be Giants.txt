Julie at the station says they'll be here any minute now
But she's running out of records and her show is ending anyhow
They can hear her saying their name on the car radio
But the signal keeps fading out no matter which way they go
I heard they might be somewhere in this town
They Might Be Giants got lost driving around

John said to John, I think we make a left at the light
There should be a big crinkle, assuming this map is right
John looked over and said, Hey, no it's not
It's a crumpled up wrapper from the fast food that we got
I heard they might be somewhere in this town
They Might Be Giants got lost driving around

Dan said to Hal, "I see somebody walking this way"
So They rolled down the window and said, "Hello. Hey excuse me, hey"
"Could you tell us where we are and the best way out of here"
They could tell from his expression he had absolutely no idea
I heard they might be somewhere near this town
They Might Be Giants got lost driving around
Driving around
Driving around
They're still driving around
