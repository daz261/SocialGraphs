(Listen while they're comin man hurry up put the pipe down shh be quiet)

[Chorus: Shock G]
Enter a new dimension
Can't you feel the tension
Ever heard the word prevention
Well you really need to pay attention
You only need a little bit
So you want another hit?
Call emergency on the telephone
You're in the danger zone

("Just lounge, you're in the danger zone" -- Erick Sermon) 4X

[Verse One: Shock G]
You're in the zone, when you need another upper (another upper)
You took a slip and goin out like a sucker (like a sucker)
Matter of fact, you're more than just slippin
You're way beyond control, you're on a mission (on a mission)
You walk right through a wall
To get a twenty, a forty or an Eight Ball
And once you enter this area
There ain't nothin scarier, and all I wanna say to ya
Is just back the hell up (back the hell up)
You need to go where they let you do your thing in a cup (thing in a cup)
And you take a diagnosis
You see your boy Shock G wrote this (wrote this)
To open up your mind
Do you know who I am, deliverer of the rhyme
My job is to verbally slay suckers
Like an uzi spray motherfuckers (spray motherfuckers)
The Underground is gonna get ya
Now pay attention you're about to enter

[Chorus: Shock G]
Into a new dimension
Can't you feel the tension
I'm sure you heard the word prevention
So like I said pay attention
You only need a little bit
Ya still want another hit?
Even if it's home-grown
Yo, you're in the danger zone

("Just lounge, you're in the danger zone" -- Erick Sermon) 8X

[Verse Two: Kenny K]
On the corner, I see cocaine addicts (cocaine addicts)
Givin static and about to go at it (bout to go at it)
And then you hear somebody holler
(Who was it K?)  It was Dopefiend Carla
She was waitin on a winner (on a winner)
That ho, every night she has crack for dinner (crack for dinner)
But everybody's basin'
Even the suckers who are runnin this nation
Yes, I'm pullin no punches
The government gets drugs in bunches
Shock G, get the nine
But don't shoot until I finish my rhyme
This zone, makes suckers stop breathin (stop breathin)
Sweat bullets drop down to their knees and
Start beggin for your pipe cause you're all in
Sometimes you can feel yourself fallin'

[Chorus: Shock G]
Into a new dimension
Can't you feel the tension?
Don't let me forget to mention
The Underground is puttin their two cents in
What's the matter, feelin' blue?
Does this record bother you?
If so, you need to leave it alone
You're in the danger zone

("Just lounge, you're in the danger zone" -- Erick Sermon) 8X

[Verse Three: Shock G]
Caught a red light downtown (downtown)
Freak was on the tip, cause my window was down
Stuck her head in the car, it was Dopefiend Carla
She said "Can you spare five dollars?"  I said "hell no"
She said "I'm not asking for much"
I said "bitch, I'd rather give a crippled crab a crutch (crab a crutch)"
She said "Why you wanna clown me"
I said "It's simple, I don't like fiends hangin round me
Can't you see, that you got a disease?
You weight sixty-six pounds, down from a hundred and three"
The light turned green and I was gone
She was livin in the danger zone

[Chorus: Shock G]
It's a new dimension
Can't you feel the tension
You recognize this sound
Go on, just put the pipe down
What's the matter, feelin blue?
Does this record bother you??
If so you need to leave it alone
Punk, you're in the danger zone

[Shock G as a cop through a walkie talkie]
Uhh I'm at the 9600 block of Macarthur, Apartment A

Sex packets, a dollar or two
Just tell me, how many for you
This time... this time...
This time... this time...
Sex packets, the girl of your dreams
Just try one, it's not what it seems
There's love... there's love...
There's love... there's love...
Now it's just sex in a pill
It gives me such a thrill, it's nice
And it's a guy for a girl, or a girl for a guy
Try one tonight
Now I just can't wait, till I get home tonight
I got three for $10.99
No sex can be safer
It's a pill, wrapped in a little piece of paper
Real nice
Sex packets, a dollar or two
Just tell me, how many for you
This time... this time...
This time... this time...
Sex packets, a one or a two
I just sell them, I cannot do
This love... this love...
This love... this love...
Oh ohh girl
You look so good to me, you're fine
And oh ohh girl
You whispered in my ear, said "Not tonight"
You just won't get with me, and you think that you dissed me
But now I can still be gettin busy
With any girl I like
No more will I ever have to jack it
Cause instead, I can just take a packet
Real nice
Sex packets, a dollar or two
Just tell me, how many for you this time
This time
This time... this time...
