[Intro]
Do you know what I'm singing?

[Verse 1]
Oh, yeah
Clean as a whistle
Smellin' like a rose
She got her dirty little finger
Bloodshot eyes are gone
You wanna tell me that I'm wrong

[Chorus]
Twice as hard
As it was the first time
I said goodbye
Twice as hard (One time, baby, two time)
First time, I said goodbye

[Post-Chorus]
Nobody ever wanna know
Love ain't funny
It's a crime in the wink of an eye

[Verse 2]
Oh, yeah
Your sister always singing
She plays the step child
A broken little memory
I was never kind
Are you the one to tell me I'm blind?

[Chorus]
Twice as hard
As it was the first time
I said goodbye
Twice as hard (Two time)
As it was the first time
I said goodbye

[Post-Chorus]
Nobody ever wanna know
Love ain't funny
It's a crime in the wink of an eye

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, bloodshot eyes are gone
And you think you're the one to tell me I'm wrong

[Chorus]
Twice as hard
As it was the first time
I said goodbye
Twice as hard
As it was the first time
I said goodbye
(Twice, baby) Twice as hard
As it was the first time
I said goodbye
Twice as hard
As it was the first time
Bye

[Outro]
So you did come to have a good time
This next selection is one off our album
And it is entitled could I, could I, could I, "Could I've Been So Blind"

 

[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
I find it hard to shed a tear
Oh, you brought it on yourself, my dear
And wrong, yes, I may be
Don't you dare, don't you dare leave no light on, no light on for me
'Cause, baby, I ain't comin' home
Oh, but you know it hurts me, it hurts me to be alone
Yeah, it hurts me, baby

[Verse 2]
A hundred years that ain't never gonna ease
Oh, I'm hearing all the things, all the things, all the things that I just can't believe
But I saw it, I saw it with my own two eyes
All the pain that, baby, that this heart, this heart just cannot hide
But you know that this pain starts in my heart
And love tears us apart
You won't find me down on, on my knees, baby
You won't find me bendin' over backwards, baby
Just to please, show me, please

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm seeing things for the first time
Seeing it, oh, for the first time
Seeing it for the first time
In my life
Hey, it's in my life
Chuck Leavell on the Hammond organ

[Verse 2]
Oh, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
I used to dream
Of a better day that you know, that you know never, ever came
"Sorry," that don't mean nothin' to me
Oh, baby, I'm gone, I'm out the door
And you know that's the way that things gotta, gotta be
So, baby, you know I've done my time
I didn't know that lovin' you was such a crime
And you won't find me down on my knees
No, no, no, no, no, no
You won't find me bendin' over backwards, baby
Just to please, show me, baby, one thing

[Chorus]
Seeing things for the first time
Seeing it, ow, for the very first time
Seeing it for the first time
Seeing it, baby
I don't wanna, I don't wanna, I don't wanna cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry
'Cause I'm seeing things for the first time
In my life
Oh, baby, you know, you know, you know, you know it's my life

 

[Intro]
Yeah, make some noise

[Verse 1]
Baby, here I am, a man on the scene
I give you what you want, got you comin' home with me
Got all my love, little more in store
Get through throwin' it on you, you got to come back for more

[Chorus]
Boys and things that come by the dozen, did you know?
That ain't nothin' but drugstore lovin'
Pretty little thing, let me light your candle
'Cause, mama, I'm sure hard to handle now, yes, sir, I am

[Verse 2]
Action speaks louder than words, man of experience
Got you another man, I can love you better than him
Man, don't be afraid, prove every word I say
Advertising love for free, place your ad with me

[Chorus]
Boys like dimes around by the dozen, ten cent lovin'
Pretty little thing, let me light your candle
'Cause, mama, I'm sure hard to handle now, yes, sir, I am
Yeah, gotta get it hard

[Verse 3]
Baby, I am, on the scene
Give you, give you, give you what you want, baby
Come on home with me
Got all my love, little more in store
Throwin' shit on you, back for more

[Chorus]
Boys like dimes around by the dozen, drugstore love
Pretty little thing, let me light your candle
'Cause, mama, I'm sure hard to handle now, yes, sir, I am
Yeah, got to get hard
Jeffrey Cease

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Boys like dimes around by the dozen, ten cent love
(Pretty little thing, let me light your candle)
('Cause, mama, I'm sure hard to handle now)
You did good!
Nicely done, nicely done

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
[? 2:50 'til the morning]
One time
Alright
Thank you so much!
This song, we call it "Shake, Shake, Shake, Shake, Shake 'Em On Down"

 

Find me wrecked in the mornin'
Waiting for the wheels to get rollin'
Starving, got a headache crawling
Some say, I'm only harmless
Yeah baby, harmless

Praying, waiting for the sunset
Complaining, just to hear myself talking
Broke down, so lonely-hearted
Some say, when the show gets going
Yes, baby going

And everybody starts singing, "Man, he looks a wreck"
Singing, "What a charming little mess"
Singing, "Wonder if he'll see next week"

Catch me, down the drain twisted
Pinch me, just to see if I'm breathing
Bleeding, it's only when I'm singing
I know I can never see clеarer
Oh yes baby, clearеr

And everybody starts singing, "Man, he looks a wreck"
Singing, "What a charming little mess"
Singing, "Wonder if he'll see next week"
Whoo

And everybody starts singing, "Man, he looks a wreck"
Singing, "What a charming little mess"
Singing, "Well, I wonder if he'll ever, ever
Wanna see next week"

Singing, "Man, he looks a wreck"
Singing, "What a charming little mess"
Singing, "Well, I wonder if he'll ever, ever
Wanna see next week"

Singing, "Man, he looks a wreck"
Singing, "What a charming little mess"
Singing, "Well, I wonder, baby, if he'll ever
Ever gonna see next week"
