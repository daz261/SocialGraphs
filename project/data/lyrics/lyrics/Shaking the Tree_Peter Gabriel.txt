[Intro]
Hey, hey, you
Tell me how have you been?

[Verse 1]
You could have a steam train
If you just lay down your tracks
You could have an aeroplane flying
If you bring your blue sky back
All you do is call me
I'll be anything you need

[Verse 2]
You could have a big dipper
Going up and down, all around the bends
You could have a bumper car, bumping
This amusement never ends

[Chorus 1]
I wanna be your sledgehammer
Why don't you call my name?
Oh, let me be your sledgehammer
This will be my testimony

[Verse 3]
Show me 'round your fruit cage
'Cause I will be your honey bee
Open up your fruit cage
Where the fruit is as sweet as can be

[Chorus 2]
I wanna be your sledgehammer
Why don't you call my name?
You'd better call the sledgehammer
Put your mind at rest
I'm going to be the sledgehammer
This can be my testimony
I'm your sledgehammer
Let there be no doubt about it

[Post-Chorus]
Sledge, sledge
Sledgehammer

[Interlude]

[Outro]
I get it right
I kicked the habit
Kicked the habit, kicked the habit
Shed my skin
Shed my skin
This is the new stuff
This is the new stuff
I go dancing in
We can go dancing in
Oh, won't you show for me?
Show for me
I will show for you
Show for you
Show for me
Show for me
Oh, I will show for you
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I do mean you
Show for me
Only you
You been coming through
Show for you
I'm gonna build that power
Build, build up that power, hey
Show for me
I've been feeding the rhythm
I've been feeding the rhythm
Show for you
Gonna feel that power, hey, build in you
Show for me
Come on, come on, help me do
Come on, come on, help me do
Show for you
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you
Show for me
I've been feeding the rhythm
I've been feeding the rhythm
Show for you
It's what we're doing, doing
All day and night
Show for me
Come on, come on, help me do
Come on, come on, help me do
Show for you
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you
Show for me
I've been feeding the rhythm...

 

[Verse 1]
The streets are lined with camera crews
Everywhere he goes is news
Today is different, today is not the same
Today I make the action, take snapshot into the light
Snapshot into the light, I'm shooting into the light

[Verse 2]
Four miles down the cavalcade moves on
Driving into the sun
If I worked it out right, they won't see me or the gun
Two miles to go, they're clearing the road
And the cheering has really begun
I've got my radio, I can hear what's going on

[Bridge 1]
I've been waiting for this
I've been waiting for this
All you people in TV land
I will wake up your empty shells
Peak-time viewing blown in a flash
As I burn into your memory cells
'Cause I'm alive

[Verse 3]
They're coming around the corner with the bikers at the front
I'm wiping the sweat from my eyes
It's a matter of time, a matter of will
And the governor's car is not far behind, he's not the one I've got in mind
'Cause there he is, the man of the hour, standing in the limousine

[Bridge 2]
I don't really hate you, I don't care what you do
We were made for each other, me and you
I want to be somebody, you were like that too
If you don't get given you learn to take
And I will take you
Holding my breath
Release the catch
And I let the bullet fly

[Outro]
All turned quiet, I have been here before
A lonely boy hiding behind the front door
Friends have all gone home
There's my toy gun on the floor
Come back, Mum and Dad
You're growing apart, you know that I'm growing up sad
I need some attention
I shoot into the light

 

[Verse 1]
Looking down on empty streets, all she can see
Are the dreams all made solid
Are the dreams made real
All of the buildings, all of the cars
Were once just a dream
In somebody's head
She pictures the broken glass, pictures the steam
She pictures a soul
With no leak at the seams

[Bridge]
Let's take the boat out
Wait until darkness
Let's take the boat out
Wait until darkness comes

[Verse 2]
Nowhere in the corridors of pale green and grey
Nowhere in the suburbs
In the cold light of day
There in the midst of it, so alive and alone
Words support like bone

[Chorus]
Dreaming of Mercy Street
Wear your inside out
Dreaming of mercy
In your daddy's arms again
Dreaming of Mercy Street
I swear they moved that sign
Dreaming of mercy
In your daddy's arms

[Verse 3]
Pulling out the papers from drawers that slide smooth
Tugging at the darkness
Word upon word
Confessing all the secret things in the warm velvet box
To the priest, he's the doctor
He can handle the shocks
Dreaming of the tenderness, the tremble in the hips
Of kissing Mary's lips

[Chorus]
Dreaming of Mercy Street
Wear your inside out
Dreaming of mercy
In your daddy's arms again
Dreaming of Mercy Street
I swear they moved that sign
Looking for mercy
In your daddy's arms

[Interlude]

[Outro]
Mercy, mercy, looking for mercy
Looking for mercy
Mercy, looking for mercy
Looking for mercy, looking for mercy
Looking for mercy, looking for mercy
Anne, with her father, is out in the boat
Riding the water
Riding the waves on the sea
