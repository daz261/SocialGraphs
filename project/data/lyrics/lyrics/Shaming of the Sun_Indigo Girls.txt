[Intro]
I'm gonna clear my head
I'm gonna drink that sun

[Verse 1]
The saddest sight my eyes can see
Is that big ball of orange sinking slyly down the trees
Sittin' in a broken circle while you rest upon my knee
This perfect moment will soon be leaving me
Suzanne calls from Boston, the coffee's hot, the corn is high
And that same sun that warms your heart
Will suck that good earth dry
With everything it's opposite enough to keep you crying
Or keep this old world spinning with a twinkle in its eye

[Chorus]
Get out the map
Get out the map and lay your finger anywhere down
We'll leave the figuring
To those we pass on our way outta town
Don't drink the water
There seems to be something ailing everyone
I'm gonna clear my head
I'm gonna drink that sun
I'm gonna love you good and strong
While our love is good and young (Yeah)

[Verse 2]
Joni left for South Africa a few years ago
And then Beth took a job all the way over on the West Coast
And me, I'm still trying to live half a life on the road
Seems I'm heavier by the year and heavier by the load
Why do we hurtle ourselves through every inch of time and space?
I must say around some corner I can sense a resting place
With every lesson learned a line upon your beautiful face
We'll amuse ourselves one day with these memories we'll trace

[Chorus]
Get out the map
Get out the map and lay your finger anywhere down
We'll leave the figuring
To those we pass on our way outta town
Don't drink the water
There seems to be something ailing everyone
I'm gonna clear my head
I'm gonna drink that sun
I'm gonna love you good and strong
While our love is good and young

[Outro]
I'm gonna clear my head
I'm gonna drink that sun
I'm gonna love you good and strong
While our love is good and young

You are 17
Itchy trigger
And venomous
You're growing longer
You're growing stronger
So shed your skin
Baby now shed this

Come on over now
Come on over baby
You tell me it's holy holy
I don't know what it is
Come on over now
Let's call it the fullness of time
And i don't know what it is
Come on over now
Hey holy
Console me
Some power
Controls me
Remorse it
I force it
Can't free it
So be it

I'm speaking in tongues
Handling you
And i got religion now look at it
The days grow longer
As we grow stronger
So shed your skin baby
Let it rip

Come on over now
Come on over baby
Tell me it's holy holy
I don't know what that is
Come on over child
I want to call it the fullness of time
I don't know if it is
Come on over now
Hey holy me
Console me
Some power
Controls me
Remorse it
I force it
Don't free it
Just be it
Just be it
Just be it

I'm looking to find you
But it's a little to late
To
Well i look and doubt
If i
In you
In you

I got the hangman
I got milagro
I got the celebration too
The flesh is strong
My spirit's stronger
So shed your skin
Baby let through

Come on over now
Come on over baby
Tell me it's holy holy
Like i don't know what it is
Come on over child
I want to call it the fullness of time
I don't know what it is
Come on over now
Hey holy
Console me
Some power
Controls me
Remorse it
I force it
Can't free it
So be it

Hey holy
Console me
Some power
Controls me

Come on over baby
