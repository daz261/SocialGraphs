Lucy came to the timberline
Climbed up on to Rainier and
Looked out over Washington
Swore she could see the apple trees
And she said "ooo ooo oh I never wanna leave
Ooo ooo this place Ooo ooo yes I always wanna be
Right here"

Peter came to the city and
Climbed up into Liberty and
Looked out over Manhattan
He swore he could see the beauty there
And he said " ooo ooo oh I never wanna leave
Ooo ooo this place
Ooo ooo yes I always wanna be
Right here"

Find a place
To call home
Any place
To call home
Right here

And so I came in the dead of night
Climbed up into the satellite and
Looked out over America
I swear I could see the buffalo
Ooo ooo oh and I never wanna leave
Ooo ooo this place
Ooo ooo yes I always wanna be
Right here
Right here
