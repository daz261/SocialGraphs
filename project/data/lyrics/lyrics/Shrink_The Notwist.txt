Chemicals will hit you
Chemicals will knock you down
Is it over cause you feel no pain
Throwing me around

You attack my head with numbers
You attack my room with things of glass
You attack my neighbours till you've found someone who's cleaning up the mess

You are no good
You are no good
Cause I know you can't sleep till you know your overbearance makes me creep
