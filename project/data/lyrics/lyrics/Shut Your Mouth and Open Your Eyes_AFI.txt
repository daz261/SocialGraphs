[Verse 1]
Where were you? Say you were gone?
Well, ask me and I'll swear you were there all along
Another place? Another state?
At any rate, I can't relate
There's no two ways, you're a disgrace

[Chorus]
Drown down your fear
Suffocate every spark of clarity
Your weakness: sickens me, saddens me, strengthens me
There's no way to free responsibility

[Verse 2]
Who's to blame? Who's in the wrong?
The truth from which you hide â€” it was you all along
You were there, you didn't care
And your heart and mind were self impaired
Now, all that's left is our despair

[Chorus]
Drown down your fear
Suffocate every spark of clarity
Your weakness: sickens me, saddens me, strengthens me
There's no way to free responsibility

[Chorus]
Drown down your fear
Suffocate every spark of clarity
Your weakness: sickens me, saddens me, strengthens me
There's no way to free responsibility
