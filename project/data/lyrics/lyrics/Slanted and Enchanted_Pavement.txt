[Intro]
(Hey, this guy's a fuckin' dick)
(Yeah, go)

[Verse 1]
Take me down from the ridge where the summer ends
And watch the city spread out just like a jet's flame
I've got a secret for you, I cut your angel in two
I left her bleeding and soaked it with a dry sponge

[Chorus]
No life for gingers now
No life for gingers now
No life for gingers now
I can see it fade

[Intro]
(Hey motherfuckin' dick, I can taste it)
(Bleedin' skulls)

[Verse 2]
We've got a license to live, it's our only one
If it expires we fly- float up to the dust haze
I've got a picture of you, I cut your angel in two
I saw her spinning and dripping on your new dress

[Chorus]
No life for gingers now
No life for gingers now
No life for gingers now
I can see it fade

[Outro]
[Unintelligible screaming]
