Got a lot that I want to do
I've got the feet, but I don't have the shoes
Yeah, yes yes ma'am
Wash it down with how great I am
I want a lackey
Looks like you
Won't fuss and wine
I want a lackey
Could be you
My friend has one and I want one too
I want a lackey, check out a lackey
Andale, make it quick
Lay it on, lay it on thick
Light my smokes, fill my glass
Pucker up and kiss my big white ass
Small time, Small mind
I want a lackey
