I've been convicted with and without reason
Tarred and feathered like a piper on a killing spree
And felt the anger of generations
And been the target of the cheap shots of authority

So you think you cut me down to size
Well there's something you should realize
It's gonna take more than a break in the law
To make me smile pretty for the wreckin' ball

Won't beg, won't bleed
The end of sacrifice is a threat to society
Hard line, you'll see
Once you've made a mark, you've made a threat to society

I wasn't put here to be treated
Like some disease you hoped would go away if left alone
You can sweep me under the carpet
But, I'll still infect your need to use me as a steppin' stone

So you think you cut me down to size
Well there's something you should realize
It's gonna take more than a break in the law
To make me smile pretty for the wreckin' ball

Won't beg, won't bleed
The end of sacrifice is a threat to society
Hard line, you'll see
Once you've made a mark, you've made a threat to society

So you think you cut me down to size
Well there's something you should realize
It's gonna take more than a break in the law
To make me smile pretty for the wreckin' ball
