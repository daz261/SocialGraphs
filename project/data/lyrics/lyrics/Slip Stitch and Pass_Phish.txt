(Billy F. Gibbons/Joe Michael Hill/Frank Lee Beard)Jesus left Chicago
And he headed down to New Orleans
Jesus left Chicago
And he headed down to New Orleans
Hey hey
Workin' from one end to the other
And all points in between

Took a drive through Mississippi
Muddy water turned to wine
Took a drive through Mississippi
Muddy water turned to wine
Hey hey
Went out to California
Through the points and through the pines

You might not see him in person
But he'll see you just the same
Might not see him in person
But he'll see you just the same
Hey hey
Don't have to worry about nothin'
'Cuz takin' care of business is His name

Jesus left Chicago
And he headed down to New Orleans
Jesus left Chicago
And he headed down to New Orleans
Hey hey
Workin' from one end to the other
And all points in between
