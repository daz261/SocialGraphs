Relax in time
From the pain you've been
I don't know anything
But I can read what's on your face
Just one moment
Just one more to struggle
We all want everything
But we all can't fit in the door

Seven tries
Head to wall
Hurts your head
Sort of trust
That you'll get
What you paid for soon
Seven tries
Head to wall
Just to get cut

And it's only time
It's what you make it
I don't know what it brings
Hope for the good, hope from despair
A second, just one moment
Just one more to trust
Some time you'll get to see
You where you want to be

Seven tries
Head to wall
Hurts your head
Sort of trust
That you'll get
What you paid for soon
Seven tries
Head to wall
Just to get cut

It's what you break down
It's just a second

A thrown in towel is the first thing
Can't tell if it's the time that your gonna throw
Push through or you'll never get
To see what you gave up
Passed on

Seven tries
Head to wall
Hurts your head
Sort of trust
That you'll get
What you paid for soon
Seven tries
Head to wall

 

It's a cinch
To, pass the time with you
But hard to pass the time alone
Can you take it
And it's true
True, the couple next to you think you look strange
Alone, what are your aims
Or do you have any

Avoid confusion
You always know
Always know how much you're paying
I concentrate on
On, what the people say
The couple next to me

Pass the salt
Pour it in my wounds
You look like you have no friends
Can't keep up with the new trends
Sorry, sorry, for myself I don't agree
No, I always go out eating with my best friends
It's less than normal

Avoid confusion
You always know
Always know how much you're paying
I concentrate on
On, what the people say
The couple next to me

Avoid confusion
You always know
Always know how much you're paying
I concentrate on
On, what the people say
I think at times
