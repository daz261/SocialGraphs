For me, my love
Hahahahaha

[I. Type "A" Personality Disorder]

Hatred obsessing me
Hatred possessing me

Anger burning me
Anger turning me

Into someone I don't
Into someone I don't know
Into someone I don't know

Rage that's shaking me
Rage that's making me

Into someone I don't
Into someone I don't know
Into someone I don't know

I know you

[II. Kill You Tonight]

I'll kill you tonight
I'll kill you tonight
I'll kill you tonight
I'll fucking kill you

And now, you die

Oh, you're dead now
Woohoo

I got a pickaxe in the trunk of my car
I'll put it on the grinder to get it real sharp
There's an ugly green monster in my head
Won't leave me alone until you're dead

I called your house, but you couldn't be reached
I took the D train to Brighton Beach
You're doing the thing with a brand new man
Checking on the stars, screwing on the sand

Kill you
Kill you
Punishment
Kill you

Yeah, I took some steroids and adrenaline
Finlandia vodka, hallucinogens
Mixed it with blood and orange juice
Liquid protein and ice cubes

Staring down at your sweaty embraces
Put my tool right through your faces
Well, buddy-boy, I hope you enjoyed her
'Cause I'm an equal opportunity destroyer

Kill you
Kill you
Punishment
Kill you

I'll kill you tonight
I'll kill you tonight
I'll kill you tonight
I'll fucking kill you

[III. Love You to Death]
