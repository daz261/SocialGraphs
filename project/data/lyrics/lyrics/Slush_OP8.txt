Your eyes are magnets
Where darkness has found another home
They've distanced your friends
Now you're wandering alone
Their sorrow seeps through straight to the bone
The pulse is slowing to a deadly pace
The sweat keeps pouring off your melting face
Of [?]

She's cursing not using
And part of her that hears that little voice
The speakers are distorted so she goes in for a check
Gets over all that you've done and she's purring just that [?]
Injection laws are magically engaged
Takes a minute before the deal kicks in
Throws it back
Retracings on the track
Coil of frame appears
No one can follow her down here

He's scheming and dreaming
Of ways to keep his rock n' roll alive
The phone books updated like some other cigarette smile
Saving up for a vacation with his frequent flier miles
And miles of satellite calls
Hitting up the stars before they fall
And fade away
Forever lost in space
Coil of [?] destroys
The pain that no one knew was there

Cosuming the losing of you
Using the love you lose
Consuming the losing of you
Using the love you lose
Consuming the losing of you

 

Young woman, share your fire with me
My heart is cold, my soul is free
I am a stranger in your land
A wandering man, call me sand

Oh sir, my fire is very small
It will not warm thy heart at all
But thee may take me by the hand
Hold me, and I'll call thee sand

Young woman, share your fire with me
My heart is cold, my soul is free
I am a stranger in your land
Wandering, call me sand
At night when stars light up my sky
Oh sir, I dream my fire is high
Oh, taste these lips sir if you can
Wandering man, I'll call thee sand

Oh sir, my fire is burning high
If thee should stop sir, I would die
The shooting star has crossed my land
Wandering man, she whispered... Sand (sand)

Young woman shared her fire with me
Now warms herself with memories
I was a stranger in her land
A wandering man, she called me sand

He was a stranger in my land
A wandering man
She called me
Sand
