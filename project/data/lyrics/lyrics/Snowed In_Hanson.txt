One, two, three, four! Oh!!
Merry Christmas day!
Well a way up North where the air gets cold
There's a tale about Christmas that we've all been
Told
And a real famous cat all dressed up in red
And spends his whole year workin out on his sled
He's a little Saint Nick (little Saint Nick)
He's a little Saint Nick (little Saint Nick)
Oh yeah!
Just a little bobsled, we call it old Saint Nick
And she'll walk the toboggan with a 4-speed stick
She's a candy apple red with a ski for a wheel
And when Santa gives her gas, man, watch her peel!
Run run reindeer, run run reindeer
Run run reindeer, run run reindeer
He don't miss no one
Well hauling through the snow at a frightening speed
And a half a dozen reindeer with a Rudy to lead
Well he's gotta wear shades cuz the snow really flies
Cuz he's cruisin every pad with a little surprise
Run run reindeer, run run reindeer
Run run reindeer, run run reindeer
He don't miss no one
Well hauling through the snow at a frightening speed
And a half a dozen reindeer with a Rudy to lead
Well he's gotta wear shades cuz the snow really flies
Cuz he's cruisin every pad with a little surprise
Oh Merry Christmas!
Christmas comes this time each year, Christmas comes
This time each year!
Ooh! Merry Christmas! Yeah!
Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas
Christmas comes this time each year, Merry Christmas
Yeah!
