Lonely, you on my mind
How could I let you go
All that we've been through
I still need you next to me
I said so many things
I did not mean to say
And although we tried to talk
The words, they got in the way
Now that I realise
I need you with me
I've got to find a way to make you see

This time, it could be forever
This time, it could be so complete
It's time for us to be together
Now I know what you mean to me

Now that I understand
Through all this loneliness
I need no other man
So here I am, I'm still needing you
As you were leaving
I knew I was to blame
But I'm not gonna beg you
To come back and stay
So make up your mind now
'Cos it's all up to you
Yes, we owe it to ourselves to see this through

This time, it could be forever
This time, it could be so complete
It's time for us to be together
Now I know what you mean to me

No one could hold me
No one could have told me
That I would be feeling this way
The day's getting longer
The feeling is stronger
Put an end to this pain right away

This time, it could be forever
This time, it could be so complete
It's time for us to be together
Now I know what you mean to me

Oh what I fool I must have been
To lose the love that you were giving me

This time, it could be forever
This time, it could be so complete
It's time for us to be together
Now I know what you mean to me

I'm still wanting you, needing you
Missing you, feeling you in my dreams
Are you still wanting me, needing me
Missing me, feeling me in your dreams
'Cos the day you come back to me
That's how it's gonna be, just you and me
Just you and me

This time, it's gonna be, it's gonna be you and me
This time, I want it to be so complete
This time, this time it has to be together
Oh baby, it's gonna be, it's gonna be, it's gonna be......
