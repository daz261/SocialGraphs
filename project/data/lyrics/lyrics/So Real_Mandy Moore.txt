[Intro]
I
Love to love you
I
Love to love you

[Verse 1]
Some boys are full of noise
But boy, you've caught my ear
Wanna see if you've got something to say
No lies or alibis
The nonsense stops here
Be my friend or you coyld be on your way

[Pre-Chorus]
Play it smart, boy
(Whatcha gonna do? Whatcha gonna do?)
If you wanna reach me
Touch my heart, boy
(Whatcha gonna do? Whatcha gonna do?)
'Cause that's how to please me...

[Chorus]
What you want
I can be
I'm the girl of your fantasy
As long as you love me (As long as you love me)
What you want
I can do (I can do)
All I ask of you (Oh, ow)
Is baby you love me

[Verse 2]
Some boys want pretty toys
But I'm so much more
Can't you see that I'm a girl you can trust?
Get real with how you feel
Or I'm out that door
Is it love or is it only a crush?

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Listen up, boy
(Whatcha gonna do? Whatcha gonna do?)
And stop talking smack now
Back it up, boy
(Whatcha gonna do? Whatcha gonna do?)
Boy, step off that track now

[Chorus]
What you want
I can be
I'm the girl of your fantasy
As long as you love me (As long as you love me)
What you want
I can do (I can do)
All I ask of you (Oh, ow)
Is baby, you love me
What you want
I can be
I'm the girl of your fantasy
As long as you love me (As long as you love me)
What you want
I can do (I can do)
All I ask of you (Oh, ow)
Is baby you love me

[Bridge]
I
Love to love you
Oh
Love, is this love?
Does it fall from Heaven above?
Do you feel it, boy?
Can you feel me, boy?

[Pre-Chorus]
I know it's not right
I know it's not wrong
But right here right now
Is where I belong

[Chorus]
What you want
I can be
I'm the girl of your fantasy
As long as you love me (As long as you love me)
What you want
I can do (I can do)
All I ask of you (Oh, ow)
Is baby, you love me
What you want
I can be
I'm the girl of your fantasy
As long as you love me (As long as you love me)
