You want to cause me death, when you are acting that way
I'm wrapped around your fingertips, I beg you stay
I'd always thought that we were two of a kind
But no we are not, now you can kiss my behind

Oh - you know I tried, but now I'd rather die
Than be with you again
I always tried, but now I've realized
I won't go through this again

Believe it or not, but I'm still alive
You're feeding off my blood just like a kick in the eye
Everytime you hurt me, I lie helpless for a day
I try to stand up but you're in my way

Everytime you hurt me, I lie helpless for a day
I try to stand up but you're in my way

You know I tried, but now I'd rather die
Than be with you again
I always tried, but now I've realized
I won't go through this again

Bitch! You know I cried, but now I'd rather die
Than be with you again
I always tried, but now I've realized
I won't go through this again
