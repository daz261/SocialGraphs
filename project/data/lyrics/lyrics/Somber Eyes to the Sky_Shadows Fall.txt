I'll not want for longing
It causes heartache yet this singularity burns just the same
Hope for ash of memory, this is pure agony
Eyes, they are too blind to see, this is pure agony
I'll not beg for you, this is pure agony
Knowing what's been true, this is pure agony
Fall from your light world, not again, this breeds fear
My life weakens and the pain I hold tight
Life hurts so now, I have no power here
Cease living somehow, I long to release you
As I fall I...As I fall we cry in despair
Don't be lifeline...don't be my lifeline, let me fall away
Alone, desolate.. alone and desolate am I the only one
Can it be real... can it be real, I can't go on
If you return here can I not ease the pain?
Forever knowing...loneliness....denial..I am the last one
Now would you look away?
Leave me alone here, That would tear me apart
As I fall I...As I fall we cry in despair
Don't be, lifeline....don't be my lifeline
Now deliver my soul
Your love walks away...leaves me as a child
Exposed to the horror I begin to cry
Emotions like velvet now caress my flesh...the truth that I run from
Pure, would you run away and leave me here to suffer?
Pain what did you want that I could not provide?
Pure would you run away and leave me here to suffer?
Pain what did you want that I could not provide
Fall from your light world, not again, this breeds fear
My life weakens and the pain I hold tight
Life it hurts so now, I have no power here
Cease living somehow, I long to release you
As I fall I...As I fall we cry in despair
Don't be, lifeline...don't be my lifeline, let me fall away
Alone desolate...along and desolate I am the only one
Can it be real... can it be real, I can't go on
