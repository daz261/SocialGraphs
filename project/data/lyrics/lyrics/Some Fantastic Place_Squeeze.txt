She gave to me her tenderness
Her friendship and her love
I see her face from time to time
There in the sky above
We grew up learning as we went
What a voyage our life could be
It took us through a wilderness
Into the calmest sea
Her smile could lift me from the pain
I often found within
She said some things I won't forget
She made a few bells ring
So simple her humility
Her beauty found in grace
Today she lives another life
In some fantastic place
She showed me how to raise a smile
Out of her bed of gloom
And in her garden sanctuary
A life began to bloom
She visualised a world ahead
And planned how it would be
She left behind the strongest love
That lives eternally
I have the hope that when it's time
For me to come her way
That she'll be there to show me round
Whenever comes that day
Her love was life and happiness
And in her steps I trace
The way to live a better life
In some fantastic place

 

As much as I love you
As much as I care
I just can't pretend that
The problem's not there
We know all the boundaries
From where we both stand
Our life has been happy
Without any plan
But now I feel sorrow
As friendship turns stale
Our love's still on track but
Without a third rail
The moon has come up now
The sun has gone down
A million or more times
Since you've been around
Our life still goes on but
It won't be the same
As when we're together
Love only knows pain
With words that are tender
Our love will prevail
But can our love go on
Without a third rail

White clouds appear like cotton wool
The wind bends trees to bow
As we farewell this love of ours
Like some old sacred cow
As sure as heaven's above us
And hell is down below
Without a third rail to drive us
We'll have no place to go

There's a lump in my throat
I'm choked as I say
Our love has reached twilight
Let's call it a day
We kiss on the platform
The doors slowly close
Like theatre curtains
Pulled after the show
We both know it's over
And somehow we've failed
Love's going in circles
Without a third rail
