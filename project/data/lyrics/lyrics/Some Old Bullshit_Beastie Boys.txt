Aaahhh, B-E-A-S-T-I-E go
B-E-A-S-T-I-E
That's just what Beasties gotta be
Can't you see this is an emergency
Can you feel the urgency
B-E-A-S-T-I-E
B-E-A-S-T-I-E
With the hold of democracy
In a state of emergency now

Aaahhh, going out to rock the state
Let's just come and take unique
All across the stormy sea
Better days in democracy
B-E-A-S-T-I-E
B-E-A-S-T-I-E
Captain stayed off so merrily
In a state of emergency now

Aaahhh, B-E-A-S-T-I-E
Cops just don't have respect to me
World is filled with tyranny
All across the stormy sea
B-E-A-S-T-I-E
B-E-A-S-T-I-E
Who the hell are we off to see?
Let's just come and take unique
Now B-E-A-S-T-I-E go
B-E-A-S-T-I-E go
