Once I was a sentimental thing;
Threw my heart away each spring
Now a spring romance
Hasn't got a chance
Promised my first dance to winter
All I've got to show's a splinter
For my little fling

Spring this year has got me feeling
Like a horse that never left the post
I lie in my room
Staring up at the ceiling
Spring can really hang you up the most

Morning's kiss wakes trees and flowers
And to them I'd like to drink a toast
But I walk in the park
Just to kill the lonely hours
Spring can really hang you up the most

All afternoon the birds twitter-twitt
I know the tune. This is love, this is it
Heard it before
And don't I know the score
And I've decided that spring is a bore

Love seems sure around the new year
Now it's April. Love is just a ghost
Spring arrived on time
Only what became of you, dear?
Spring can really hang you up the most
Spring can really hang you up the most

Love came my way. I thought it would last
We had our day, now it's all in the past
Spring came along, a season of song
Full of sweet promise
But something went wrong

Doctors once prescribed a tonic
Sulfur and molasses was the dose
Didn't help one bit
My condition must be chronic
Spring can really hang you up the most

All alone, the party is over
Old man winter was a gracious host
But when you keep praying
For snow to hide the clover
Spring can really hang you up the most
