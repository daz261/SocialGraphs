My heart it is eternal
And my soul it often flies
You can see it in the evenings soaring through the skies
And it takes me close to madness
Though it never really tries

I've crossed a million rivers
And I've walked a million miles
I've kissed a holy angel and I've tried to show some style
I never even questioned
How I know it's all worthwhile

But I'm gonna make it through and I'm gonna do it all
And I'm gonna make it through and I'm gonna do it all
And I'm gonna make it through and I'm gonna do it all
I will fall

My legs they get so tired
And my head it often screams
You can hear the thoughts all turning overload of fears and dreams
I don't mind the sting of feeling
But it burns when I'm empty

I'll ride the road I've chosen
And at times I know I'll fall
I have nothing to lose now so I want to taste it all
Wintertime in Glendale
Till the next location calls

But I'm gonna make it through and I'm gonna do it all
And I'm gonna make it through and I'm gonna do it all
And I'm gonna make it through and I'm gonna do it all
I will fall

I'm gonna make it through and I'm gonna do it all
And I'm gonna make it through and I'm gonna do it all
And I'm gonna make it through and I'm gonna do it all
I will fall

I'm gonna make it through and I'm gonna do it all
And I'm gonna make it through and I'm gonna do it all
And I'm gonna make it through and I'm gonna do it all
I will fall

Well there's no one left but you now babe
Got to say that it's your call

I'm gonna make it through and I'm gonna do it all
And I'm gonna make it through and I'm gonna do it all
And I'm gonna make it through and I'm gonna do it all
I will fall
