Some people like to gamble
But you, you always lose
Some people like to rock 'n' roll
You're always singing the blues

You got a nasty disposition
No one really knows the reason why
You got a bad, bad reputation
Gonna hang down your head and cry

Y'got bad, bad luck
Bad, bad luck
Y'got bad, bad luck
Bad, bad luck

Thirteen's my lucky number
To you it means stay inside
Black cat done crossed my path
No reason to run and hide

You're looking through a cracked mirror
No one really knows the reason why
Your enemies are getting nearer
Gonna hang down your head and cry

Y'got bad, bad luck
Bad, bad luck
Y'got bad, bad luck
Bad, bad luck

Some people go to church on Sundays
Others, they pray at home
You tell them that there ain't no God
That they're better off standing alone

You're always scratching at the eight ball
No one really knows the reason why
You get to the top and then you fall
Gonna hang your head down and cry

Y'got bad, bad luck
Bad, bad luck
Y'got bad, bad luck
Bad, bad luck
Y'got bad, bad luck
Bad, bad luck, c'mon give it to me
Bad, bad luck
Bad, bad luck, c'mon give it

 

Making believe that you still love me
It's leaving me alone and so blue
I'll always dream, but I'll never own you
Making believe is all I can do

Making believe that you still love me
It's leaving me alone and so blue
I'll always dream, but I'll never own you
Making believe is all I can do

I can't hold you close
Darling, when you're not with me
You're somebody's love
You'll never be mine

Making believe
I'll spend my lifetime
Loving you
And making believe

I can't hold you close
Darling, when you're not with me
You're somebody's love
You'll never be mine

Making believe
I'll spend my lifetime
Loving you
And making believe

Making believe that you still love me
It's leaving me alone and so blue
I'll always dream, but I'll never own you
Making believe is all I can do

I can't hold you close
Darling, when you're not with me
You're somebody's love
You'll never be mine

Making believe
I'll spend my lifetime
Loving you
And making believe

Just loving you
And making believe

Just loving you
And making believe
