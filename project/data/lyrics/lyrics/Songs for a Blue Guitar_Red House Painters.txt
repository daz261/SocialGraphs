When everything we felt fails
And some music soft and distant sails
But it don't sound like it did before
Then I know I'm left with nothing more
Than my own soul

When pretty pictures face back
But your coats aren't hanging on the rack
And blue water turns to
A place I can't get to, a place that I can't

In the room all I feel is the cold that you left
Through the air all I see is your face full of blame
What's left to see
What's there to see

In the room all I feel is the cold that you left
Through the air all I see is your face full of blame
What's left to see, what's left to see
