What a day for a daydream
What a day for a daydreamin' boy
And I'm lost in a daydream
Dreamin' bout my bundle of joy

And even if time ain't really on my side
It's one of those days for takin' a
Walk outside
I'm blowin' the day to take a walk
In the sun
And fall on my face on somebody's
New mowed lawn

I've been havin' a sweet dream
I've been dreamin' since I woke up
Today

It's starred me and my sweet dream
'Cause she's the one makes me feel
This way

And even if time is passin' me by a lot
I couldn't care less about the dues you
Say I got
Tomorrow I'll pay the dues for droppin'
My load
A pie in the face for bein' a sleepy
Bull toad

And you can be sure that if you're
Feelin' right
A daydream will last a long into
The night
Tomorrow at breakfast you may pick
Up your ears
Or you may be daydreamin' for a
Thousand years

What a day for a daydream
Custom made for a daydreamin' boy
And I'm lost in a daydream
Dreamin' 'bout my bundle of joy
