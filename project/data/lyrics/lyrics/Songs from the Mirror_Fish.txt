Are you going to the party?
Are you going to the Boston Tea Party?

Redcoats in the village
There's fighting in the streets
The Indians and the mountain men, well
They are talking when they meet
The king has said he's gonna put a tax on tea
And that's the reason you all Americans drink coffee

Are you going to the party?
Are you going to the Boston Tea Party?

Fire in the mountains, flames upon the heath
And the president spits out the news
He's biting on wooden teeth
The children of the colonies
Got a different tale to tell
I'm going down to the city
Tell my folks I'm doing well

Are you going to the party?
Are you going to the Boston Tea Party?

Bringing back the buffalo to the long prairie
Bringing back the fishes swimming in the sea
The children of the colonies
Got a different tale to tell
I'm going down to the city
Tell my folks I'm doing well

Are you going to the party?
Are you going to the Boston Tea Party?
