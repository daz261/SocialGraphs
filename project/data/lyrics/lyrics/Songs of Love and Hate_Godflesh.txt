Don't use it
If you can't feel it
Don't be it
If you don't see it
In a world
So full of pain
I can barely
Say your name
Don't use it
If you can't see it
Forgive

 

Forget yourself
Just don't respect yourself
Reject yourself
Just don't respect yourself
Feel weak
You just mean nothing
Feel owned
Just feel like nothing
Stand down
Show your weak
Stand down
Make them smile
Don't see yourself
Don't see outside yourself
