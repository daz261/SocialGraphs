I feel the pressure pushing down on me
Can't face the world, can't change the things I see
I got my hands in my pockets staring at the walls
Can nobody help me to escape from it all?
I hear voices in my head, they taunt me
Can't lock them out inside my thoughts, they breathe in me
I got my hands in my pockets, screaming at the walls
Can nobody help me to escape from it all?
I've got to run to be free, break the chains round my heart
Take away the pain with joy, release the man from the boy
Run to be free, run from the heart, life will take you where it goes
You can offer me salvation, feed me when I call
Don't talk to me of sanity when I'm not quite here at all
I've touched the sun, I felt its warmth in me
So you will never take away my dignity
'Cause I've got my hands in my pockets fighting for my cause
Can nobody help me to escape from it all?
I've got to run to be free, break the chains round my heart
Take away the pain with joy, release the man from the boy
Run to be free, run from the heart, life will take you where it goes
Run to be free, break the chains round my heart
Take away the pain with joy, release the man from the boy
Run to be free, run from the heart, life will take you where it goes
Run to be free, break the chains round my heart
Life will take you where it goes
Run to be free, run from the heart
