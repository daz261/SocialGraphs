"He has not confessed, he has made no statement, charges of murder have been accepted against him."

Judges have decimated
Meanings of our laws
Already guilty?
Something has a flaw
Wrongly accused
Blindly confused
Open your eyes
Try to realize

Don't you know
You can't see
Too damn blind
To judge me!

Wrongly accused
Blindly confused
Open your eyes
Try to realize

Don't you know
You can't see
Too damn blind
To judge me!

Laws are meant to follow
But they've misled you
Conceal their meanings
So they can suit you
Misjudged by the system
No one ever knows
Add injury to insult
No one ever knows
No one
No one knows
No one
No one
No one knows...

Blindly confused
Open your eyes
Wake up, realize!

Too damn blind
