[Intro]
Oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh oh
Oh-whoa

[Chorus]
She was a friend of mine (Yeah-yeah)
She left with my man (Why, why, why?)
She lied (Yeah-yeah), cheated (Oh, lord), took all I had (She was, yeah)
She was a friend of mine (Ooh, ooh-ooh)
She used what she knew (I don't know why)
She lied (Yeah), cheated (Ooh-oh), and left me confused

[Verse 1]
I feel so lost
Don't know why this has happened to me, ooh
My closest friend
I never would have thought it could be
You were someone
Someone I really thought I could trust
But my man, you laid, and I'm betrayed

[Chorus]
She was a friend of mine (Yeah-yeah, hey)
She left with my man (No, you lied)
She lied (And cheated), cheated (Oh-oh), took all I had (You were my friend)
She was a friend of mine (Yeah, yeah-yeah, mm-mm)
She used what she knew (Oh-oh)
She lied (You lied), cheated (Yes, you did), and left me confused

[Verse 2]
Thicker than blood
Wherever there was me, there was you, ooh
My all was your all
But that wasn't enough for you
You had to see
And try to walk a mile in my shoes
In my head, in my bed
Betrayed by my best friend

[Chorus]
She was a friend of mine (Oh, yeah-yeah)
She left with my man (Oh-ooh)
She lied (You lied), cheated (You cheated), took all I had (Yeah-yeah, oh-ooh)
She was a friend of mine (My closest friend)
She used what she knew (Yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah)
She lied (You lied), cheated (And cheated), and left me confused (And oh, I wanna know why)

[Bridge]
(Why?)
You were my friend (Why?)
I gave you all I had (Why?)
Everything, everything that you'd want (Why?)
Oh-oh-ooh-whoa-oh-oh-whoa (Why?)
You were my friend (Why?)
Oh, my sister (Why?)
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah (Why?)

[Chorus]
She was a friend of mine (Oh, you were, you were, you were)
She left with my man (How could you do this to me?)
She lied (Yeah-yeah), cheated (Yeah-yeah-yeah), took all I had (You were)
She was a friend of mine (My best friend, yeah-yeah yeah)
She used what she knew (And everything that you needed)
She lied (I gave you), cheated (Everything), and left me confused (Oh-whoa)
She was a friend of mine (Yeah-yeah)
She left with my man (You left me alone)
She lied (You lied), cheated (You cheated, yeah), took all I had (Every little thing I had)
She was a friend of mine (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
She used what she knew (You used all you knew)
She lied (You liar), cheated (And you're a cheater), and left me confused (You, whoa)
She was a friend of mine (How could you do it, how could you do it?)
She left with my man (Yeah-yeah-yeah yeah)
She lied (You're a liar), cheated (And you're a cheater), took all I had (Hey-hey-hey yeah)
She was a friend of mine (You were my friend, yeah-yeah yeah)

[Outro]
Oh-oh, you're a liar
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-ooh

 

Mm-hm
Yeah

I got a secret
It's here in my heart
And I can't even tell my friends
How much I adore you
I'm fallin' apart
I gotta kept it deep within
The way that I love you
I can't even say
I promised not to tell a soul
It won't last too long, a feeling so strong
But I can't hide the way

I can't hide
The way I'm feeling inside
The pain is killing me, cause
I wanna let the world know
It's you I'm lovin'
I can't hide
The way I'm feeling inside
The pain is killing me, cause
I wanna let the world know
It's you I'm lovin'

It's something so special
This thing that we share
So why can't we just let it go?
It's easy to see
They know that we care
They know that we should be as one
It's out in the open
Our cover is blown
And I don't care who really knows
I need to be with you
Can't take it no more
'Cause baby, I need you

Loving you feels so right
I don't wanna have to live a lie
The way you are, the way you kiss
Drives me out of my mind
Boy, I've never loved this way before
So, I've given you the keys to my door
With every touch, I love you more
I wanna let my feelings show

I can't hide
The way I'm feeling inside
The pain is killing me, cause
I wanna let the world know
It's you I'm lovin'
I can't hide
The way I'm feeling inside
The pain is killing me, cause
I wanna let the world know
It's you I'm lovin'

Oh, I'm not afraid
I'm not afraid to let my feelings show
I can't hide them no more
No more, no more
Can't hide no more
'Cause no matter what
'Cause no matter what they say
It's never gonna change
The way that I feel for you
The way that I feel for you
'Cause boy, I love you
'Cause boy, I love you
I love you, I can't hide it, no

I can't hide
The way I'm feeling inside
The pain is killing me, cause
I wanna let the world know
It's you I'm lovin'
I can't hide
The way I'm feeling inside
The pain is killing me, cause
I wanna let the world know
It's you I'm lovin'

I can't hide
The way I'm feeling inside
The pain is killing me, cause
I wanna let the world know
It's you I'm lovin'
I can't hide
The way I'm feeling inside
The pain is killing me...
