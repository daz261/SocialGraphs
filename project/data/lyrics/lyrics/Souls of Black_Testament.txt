Locked in the darkened world
Made to never last
That's where the dreams you seek
Are like stories from the past
Sweet infant child's born
Sweet mother of the womb
Hope it is over soon
Not much more can I take

Help me lord
I'm falling fast
Bring me back

Nerves slip away from
Within your conscious mind
Translucent hopes are now
Nothing but dismal eves
You lived your life so down
To the bitter end
Better think it over now
Your life has just begun

Help me lord
I'm falling fast
Bring me back
From suicide

Just show me life is how
And not a bitter war
The odds in favor now
It's hard to live and learn
Silence the sorrow
And don't let it slip away
Think of tomorrow
As the future of today

Help me lord
I'm falling fast
Bring me back
From suicide
I'm falling fast

Locked in the darkened world
Made to never last
That's where the dreams you seek
Are like stories from the past
Sweet infant child's born
Sweet mother of the womb
Hope it is over soon
Not much more can I take

Help me lord
I'm falling fast
Bring me back
From suicide
I'm falling fast

 

Can't you see
That the world that we live in
Political lies
Are just corporate decisions
They'll take away
All the hopes and their promises
They'll put an end to the
Land of the livin'

Look at the lost souls
They seem so black
Look at the lost souls
Souls of black

They got control
Of the heart of a nation
Their social tribes
Seem so graciously
As time goes by
'Cause time as you came see
Will slowly die for you and me

Look at the lost souls
They seem so black
Look at the lost souls
Souls of black

So put an end
To this idolization
Antagonizing so commonly
Open your eyes
'Cause the lie's there so plain to see
Life goes on
There's no guarantees

Look at the lost souls
They seem so black
Look at the lost souls
Souls of black
They're bleeding so black
