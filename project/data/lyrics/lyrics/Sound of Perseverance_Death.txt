[Intro]
Look down at the body
You may see no trace of wounds
But in the eye
The eye of the beholder
One cannot assume

[Verse 1]
Not a drop of blood is drawn
But you know how it bleeds
Beware of the sharp edged weapon
Called human being

[Pre-Chorus]
It is a shield of passion
And strong will
From this I am the victor
Instead of the kill

[Chorus]
I will not feed your hunger
Instead, I bite the pain
Looking not back, but forward
I bite down

[Bridge]
Try to cover up the trail of deceit
And daggers spawned from your soul

[Verse 2]
Acid, the tears of remorse
Flow in vain, too late for regrets
Save it
For the next ill-fated game

[Pre-Chorus]
It is a shield of passion
And strong will
From this I am the victor
Instead of the kill

[Chorus]
I will not feed your hunger
Instead, I bite the pain
Looking not back, but forward
I bite down
