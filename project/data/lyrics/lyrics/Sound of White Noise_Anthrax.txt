[Verse 1]
Fix the mental, as if that changes anything
Your heart is cured now
You're normal once again
One confession
You thought that's all it took
But redemption doesn't let you off the hook

[Pre-Chorus]
One of us
Can't erase the past
To change who he would be
One of us
On a whim would act
Then look for sympathy
Not from me

[Chorus]
Hear me say
One more chance to believe in
That you can even the score
One more place at the table
Always room for one more
Room for one more

[Verse 2]
Thinking evil
Is that just your normal gig?
Fueled by hatred, happy as a stuffed pig
You're so lonely
Everyone around you reeks
Of indifference, thriving in their apathy

[Pre-Chorus]
One of us
Can't erase the past
To change who he would be
One of us
On a whim would act
Then look for sympathy
Not from me

[Chorus]
Hear me say
One more chance to believe in
That you can even the score
One more place at the table
Always room for one more
One more chance to believe in
That you can even the score
One more place at the table
Always room for one more
Room for one more

[Verse 3]
Ooh!
Your schism, my distress
Your failure is my success
Squeezed out, kept me down
What goes around, comes around
I can wait you out
Patience is my virtue
Call it payback, call it proper grounds
What goes around
Always comes around
Always comes around

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Hear me say
One more chance to believe in
That you can even the score
One more place at the table
Always room for one more
One more chance to believe in
That you can even the score
One more place at the table
Always room for one more
Room for one more
Always room for one more
