[Intro: Nick Hexum]
You got to
You got to

[Chorus: Nick Hexum]
Come original you got to come original
All entertainers come original
You got to come original you got to come original
All entertainers
Hear why

[Verse 1: Nick Hexum]
To come original it ain’t nothin’ strange
You got to represent you got come full range
Full range of emotion full range of styles
When you come to town you’ll have them comin’ for miles

[Chorus: Nick Hexum]
Come original you got to come original
All entertainers come original
You got to come original you got to come original
All entertainers
Hear why

[Verse 2: Nick Hexum]
Black Eyed Peas they comin’ full range and
NOFX they comin’ full range and
Roni Size he comin’ full range
The one Mr. Vegas you know it ain’t easy
(Original)

[Bridge 1: SA]
A warning to the crews out there who think they’re hot
If you’re not original rockers you will get shot
Down by the kids neglectin’ your art, the stuff you did
Eventually it get so bad it puts you to bed
'Cause when the lightning flashes sweet electricity
All the world then stands revealed with the clarity
Of raw voltage, briefly we see, and the hope is
You’ll be able to tell just what dope is

[Chorus: Nick Hexum]
Come original you got to come original
All entertainers come original
You got to come original you got to come original
All entertainers
Hear why

[Verse 3: Nick Hexum]
Funk slap bass mixed with the dancehall and
Hip-hop beats and punk guitar and
Deadly on the mic is the one SA
The name is 311 and you know it ain’t easy

[Bridge 2: SA]
This is not a test there’s no time to mope
How you gonna cope with radioactive isotope
And boss DJ illness upon you now quickly
Infecting you fast upon the airwaves
This message brought to you by the so large system
Activate and attune yourself with meditation
And green plants they’ve got mad life they’re sentient
They’re beautiful as you and they like to dance

(One, two, three, four)

[Bridge 3: Nick Hexum and SA]
Everything we do we gotta come original
Put your hand up in the air and prepare for battle
Sit upon the rhythm like a tire upon a rim
We do it non-stop and then we do it again
Some a them whine and some a them bitch
They can not do it never switch
Comin’ up from the heart and
Delivered with a wild pitch
Sit up on top the rhythm like a wild stallion
This is the ruling system

[Chorus: Nick Hexum]
Come original you got to come original
All entertainers come original
You got to come original you got to come original
All entertainers come original

[Outro: Nick Hexum]
You got to come original you got to come original
All entertainers come original
You got to come original you got to come original
All entertainers come original
