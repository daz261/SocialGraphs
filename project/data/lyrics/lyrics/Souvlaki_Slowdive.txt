[Verse]
See you walking and I know she's my friend again
Just the weight of the water drags me down again
Guess I'll think of the water, it's my friend, oh yeah
It's just the way that the water makes me feel again

[Chorus]
Son of Sheba, I saw him drown
Son of yellow, I saw him down
It's all I need, yeah

[Verse]
See you walking and I know she's my friend again
Just the weight of the water drags me down again
Guess I'll think of the water, it's my friend, oh yeah
It's just the way that the water makes me feel again

[Chorus]
Son of Sheba, I saw him drown
Son of yellow, I saw him down
It's all I need yeah
