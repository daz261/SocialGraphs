I used to know a girl
She had two pierced nipples and a black tattoo
We'd drink that Mexican beer, we'd live on Mexican food
Yeah, I wish I could go back
Yes, back in time

Esther used to be the kind of girl that you would never leave, yeah
She'd do anything to give me what I need for my disease
She'd do anything
I can hear them talking in the real world
Yeah, but they don't understand
That I'm happy in hell with my heroin girl
Yeah, with a heroin girl

Esther used to be the kind of lover that you would never leave, yeah
Ah, she'd do anything to give me what I need for my disease
She'd do anything
I can hear them talking in the real world
Yeah, but they don't understand
That I'm losing myself in a white trash hell
Lost inside a heroin girl
Yeah, with a heroin girl
Yeah

They found her out in the fields about a mile from home
Her face was warm from the sun but her body was cold
I heard a policeman say, "just another overdose"
Just another overdose

Esther used to be the kind of lover you would never leave, yeah
She'd do anything to give me what I need for my disease
She would do anything
