Place the stones in a circle of twelve
Give my night to brother of the bell
Rise from the light
That swallows me whole
Dig yourself
Dig yourself

Sun comes up
One great day
Foil of the cobra
Dries the sweat off my face
Righteous meek
Righteous brown
Yeah
Dig yourself, baby
Dig yourself, baby

Down that medicine now
Yeah baby
Down that medicine now
My my my baby
Down that medicine now
Yeah baby
Down that medicine now
Yeah baby

Bloods' got soul
Invade the town
Your loves got lazy
Took the world from behind
Life is sweet
As sweet as hell
Dig yourself, baby
Dig yourself, baby
Alright

Down that medicine now
Yeah baby
Down that medicine now
My my my baby
Down that medicine now
Yeah baby
Down that medicine now
Oh, baby

Make no mistake
Your violation will be televised
Muds got soul
Muds got soul
Muds got soul

 

Bought another copy of Fragile
Seeds were bustin' up the spine
I think I cracked my skull doin' airplanes
Not too many Bud's just fine
Pussy scratch and sniff in a playboy
Christ I'm a good looking man

15 miles to cop on our Sting Rays
Boys we're gonna ride tonight
Goofballs and the 70's nipples
Gotta get our heads just right
Sit me in the lap of the god's babe
Cover me with skin and hair

Bought another copy of Zoso
Seeds were bustin' up the spine
I think I wet my pants doin' Whippits
Not too many Bud's just fine
Sit me in the lap of the god's babe
Cover me with skin and hair
Ride a number one on the hump train
SCREW YOU IF YOU THINK I CARE................SMOKE
