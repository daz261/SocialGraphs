Oh the townhouse warbler lives far apart in a song
He holds the poor in his memory he never, he never lets on
He gathers strength as he gazes at length in a joy
You cannot tell from the sound of nothings been heard from his boy

He's a thief in the night and he's stealing for light you won't know it
He's already found you, his arms all around, you won't show it
Maybe one day you'll know more of, you'll know enough to say
Look over yonder he's already coming
Look over yonder he's already coming
Look over yonder he's already coming your way

Oh the caretaker's daughter she lives near the Garden of Eden
She knows the name of each flower, she remembers which let you in
She spills the sky when she looks in your eye and her jasmine
A symphony heard from a mansion when the wind sweeps in between

She's a thief in the night and she's stealing for love you won't know it
She's already found you, her arms all around, you won't show it
Maybe one day you'll know more of, you'll know enough to say
Look over yonder she's already coming
Look over yonder she's already coming
Look over yonder she's already coming your way

Oh the old engineer stays patient high in his roundhouse
He watches his trains appearing through silent puffs of snow
And his eyes are bright as he watches them nearing the time to set the track
With a flick of his wrist he waves to let them go

He's a thief in the night and he's stealing for life you won't know it
He's already found you, his arms all around, you won't show it
Maybe one day you'll know more of, you'll know enough to say
Look over yonder he's already coming
Look over yonder he's already coming
Look over yonder he's already coming your way

REPEAT CHORUS

 

I was the one who taught her to kiss
The way that she kisses you now
And you know the way she touches your cheek
Well I taught her how

I was the one who taught her to cry
When she wants you under her spell
The sight of her tear drives you out of your mind
I taught her so well

And then one day I had my love
As perfect as could be
She lived, she loved, she laughed, she cried
And it was all for me

Oh, I'll never know who taught her to lie
And now that it's over and done
Who learned the lesson when she broke my heart
I was the one

And then one day I had my love
As perfect as could be
She lived, she loved, she laughed, she cried
And it was all for me

Oh, I'll never know who taught her to lie
And now that it's over and done
Who learned the lesson when she broke my heart
I was the one
