There was a time when man stood strong
Right was right and wrong was wrong

I shoot back sho’ nuff bad
I shoot back shoot ‘em up

Now is the time
Be loud & proud
Got to make your stand
Avoid the crowd

Now I shoot back and I shoot ‘em up
Time to shoot back
Sho’ nuff bad

My kids know ‘bout family ties
Reward the truth and punish the lies

Shoot back
Got to shoot back
Time for you to shoot back
‘Cause it’s my life and I’m in charge

Make your stand
