[Verse 1]
Every day blows by in a world of corrupt addiction
With life comes pain, withdrawals, and deformation
Breaking the mould of human appearance
Contorting bodies with chemical interference

[Pre-Chorus]
The guilty one
Innocent she now cries
A life of hell
Better off to die

[Chorus]
Born without eyes
Hands, and half a brain
Being born addicted to cocaine

[Post-Chorus]
Living monstrosity
A freak for life they'll always be
Never knowing love or hate
Only pain the drug creates

[Bridge]
Some say she's naive
She's a stupid bitch
Some say to forgive
Guilty she should die

[Verse 2]
The beginning of the end begins at birth
Breeding masses of twisted screaming flesh
An example we should make out of these creators of misfortune
A serious crime that should not be forgiven

[Pre-Chorus]
The guilty one
Innocent she now cries
A life of hell
Better off to die

[Chorus]
Born without eyes
Hands, and half a brain
Being born addicted to cocaine

 

[Verse 1]
Transforming your mind from the inside out
Overcoming fear that made you doubt
Observing what is stored in the subconscious
Trusting what you feel with your gut response

[Pre-Chorus]
See past the dark
And use your energy
Learn from these images
Thoughts that we call dreams

[Chorus]
This power lies within the mind
Gain wisdom through abilities
Change what's to come in future time
Avoiding pain and misery

[Bridge]
Look through the fake from what is real
Making decisions by what you feel
Live for the future and not the past
The weak of mind will never last

[Verse 2]
Perceiving visions that reoccur
Analyse your dreams to gain
A better perspective of your life
In control of your destiny with mind and soul

[Pre-Chorus]
See past the dark
And use your energy
Learn from these images
Thoughts that we call dreams

[Chorus]
This power lies within the mind
Gain wisdom through abilities
Change what's to come in future time
Avoiding pain and misery

 

[Verse 1]
Always locking the doors to your mind
Escaping the reality that surrounds you
Using faith as an excuse to kill
A sick way of life is now revealed

[Pre-Chorus 1]
All the prayers in the world can't help you now
A killer, a taker of life is what you are

Speak no more lies
It's your turn to die

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Preach the good word
Speak no more, prepare to burn
A justified torture?
From this may others learn

The life you took
A holy death, a grave mistake
No changing your mind
Your life you should pay

[Chorus]
Practice what you preach
Your loved one is now deceased
Knowledge is at our hands
Never to understand

[Post-Chorus]
Spiritual Healing

[Verse 2]
Blinded by the twisted ways you live
Kill for religion, will the lord forgive?
Idiocy has stricken your mind
A real life hell you will find

[Pre-Chorus 1]
All the prayers in the world can't help you now
A killer, a taker of life is what you are

Speak no more lies
It's your turn to die

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Preach the good word
Speak no more, prepare to burn
A justified torture?
From this may others learn

The life you took
A holy death, a grave mistake
No changing your mind
Your life you should pay

[Chorus]
Practice what you preach
Your loved one is now deceased
Knowledge is at our hands
Never to understand

 

[Verse 1]
Those who are a waste of life
Use up air that others could breathe
Human leeches all around
Superior is what they believe

[Pre-Chorus]
Fake is the word you represent
Your existence on earth I resent
At the cost of others you get by
Each word that you speak is a lie

[Chorus]
Low life - That's all you'll ever be
Lies in effect - That's what you like to see

[Post-Chorus]
Hiding behind material values
That help cover up your weakness
Never to change, always to look
For an easy way out of life

[Bridge]
A pathetic excuse for a human being

[Verse 2]
Nothing to back you up
Never giving second thought
Thinking you fool the world
Into seeing something you are not

[Pre-Chorus]
Fake is the word you represent
Your existence on earth I resent
At the cost of others you get by
Each word that you speak is a lie

[Chorus]
Low life - That's all you'll ever be
Lies in effect - That's what you like to see

 

[Verse 1]
Extending a life
With total resistance
To fatal disease
Future methods of science

[Pre-Chorus]
Replacing what is real
By using technology
Population control
Selecting those who will breed

A specific type of form
Chosen for the unborn
A mind without emotion
Progressive anatomy

[Chorus]
Genetic reconstruction
Evolution in production

[Verse 2]
Producing a race
Of human machines
A new age of existence
The world will see

[Pre-Chorus]
Replacing what is real
By using technology
Population control
Selecting those who will breed

A specific type of form
Chosen for the unborn
A mind without emotion
Progressive anatomy

[Chorus]
Genetic reconstruction
Evolution in production

 

[Verse 1]
One mind divided into three
For every problem a personality

Each one trying to protect
For the crisis a person they'll select
With sorrow comes reassurance
With confusion there's ignorance

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Deny who they are
A fantasy gone too far

[Chorus]
Protecting the weak points of the mind
Defensive personalities
Violent one minute calm the next
Defensive personalities

[Verse 2]
Passed down from generations
Years of pain and complications

Darkness was a punishment
Memories time cannot mend
Brutalized from the day of birth
To reality they can't return

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Existing in a world
Of three lives inside of one

[Chorus]
Protecting the weak points of the mind
Defensive personalities
Violent one minute calm the next
Defensive personalities

 

[Verse 1]
To the world around he was the perfect person
Planning for an alibi he then starts rehearsing
A human bomb just waiting to explode
This secret rage can't be controlled

[Pre-Chorus]
Slaughtered the dreams of others
One left to recover
Self-inflicted wounds
Life he has consumed

[Chorus]
Planning a killing spree
Victim of a conspiracy?

[Bridge]
Getting bored with his current life
Rearranging with a knife

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2]
Greed before despair suspicion starts to grow
His life was spared for this he does not know
Screams filled the air there was no way to help
The ones he mourns he killed himself

[Pre-Chorus]
Slaughtered the dreams of others
One left to recover
Self-inflicted wounds
Life he has consumed

[Chorus]
Planning a killing spree
Victim of a conspiracy?

 

[Verse 1]
