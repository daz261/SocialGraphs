[Verse 1]
I look at her in that paper dress
I wonder why she won't burn
She's just a paper doll, that's all
Just a paper doll

[Refrain]
I dress her up, she knocks me down
I dress her up, she knocks me down

[Pre-Chorus]
They try her on for size, she fits nice
One size fits all
They try her on for size, she fits nice
One size fits all

[Chorus]
Now her soul is dead
Now her body's raw
You can numb her pain

[Verse 2]
Watch the blood run down her face
But don't take notice
And watch the blood run down her arms
Please don't take notice

[Pre-Chorus]
I know you have her soul
And I see it in your eyes
She knows you have her soul
And she sees it in your eyes

[Chorus]
Now her soul is dead
Now her body's raw
Wash away her pain

[Outro]
She wants you to eat her pain
She wants you to eat her remains
She wants you to eat her pain
She wants you to eat her remains
