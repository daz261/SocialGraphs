[Verse 1]
The streets are cracked
And there's glass everywhere
And a baby stares out
With motherless eyes
Under long gone beauty
On fields of war
Trapped in lament
To the poet's core

[Chorus]
Oh where oh where will I be
Oh where oh when that trumpets sounds

[Verse 2]
Met an Indian boy in Ottawa
He laid me down on a bed of straw
Said don't waste your breath
Don't waste your heart
Don't blister your heels
Running in the dark

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Yeah I like the heat
Of your body laying under me
May your wild lip get you where your going
With your inventions your intentions, your laughter
Your forever yearning

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
I walked to the river
And I walked to the rim
I walked through the teeth of the reaper's grin
I walked to you rolled up in wire
To the other side of desire

[Chorus][x2]

[Outro]
Well the heart opens wide like it's never seen love
And addiction stays on tight like a glove
Oh where oh where will I be
