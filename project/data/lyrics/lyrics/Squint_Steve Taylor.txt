[Verse 1]
One man's grinning from behind the net
Waits 'til the camera's adjusted
Don't you worry 'bout the flak you'll get?
Aren't you scared of getting busted?
The ball gets booted, it hits the crossbeam
Up goes the banner, John 3:16

[Chorus 1]
Oh, he don't worry 'bout the critics
(They tow the line)
He don't worry 'bout the cynics
(They live to whine)
He ain't gonna change the world
But he knows who can
Bannerman

[Verse 2]
Prime time football in the Buffalo snow
Freezing his little epidermis
Lifts that banner at the first field goal
Drinks clam chowder from a thermos
He's never missed a game, he never spells it wrong
He never talks back when they tell him "move along"

[Chorus 2]
Oh, he don't worry 'bout the critics
(They'll howl for days)
He don't worry bout the cynics
(They navel-gaze)
He ain't gonna change the world
But he knows who can
Bannerman

[Verse 3]
Sports fans everywhere are dying for a drink
But they've gotta find the well first
One man's ready with a banner and a wink
A whole lotta souls are getting well-versed
Every time I see him, I smile a little more
I can't help praying for another high score

[Chorus 2]
Oh, he don't worry 'bout the critics
(They'll howl for days)
He don't worry bout the cynics
(They navel-gaze)
He ain't gonna change the world
But he knows who can
Bannerman

[Chorus 3]
He don't worry 'bout the critics
(They've met their match)
No, he don't worry 'bout the cynics
(They sniff and scratch)
He ain't gonna change the world
But he knows who can
Bannerman

 

[Verse 1]
Strike this little pose
Chin up in the air
Lips together tightly
Nostrils in a flare
Now look like you care
Ooh, very nice!

[Verse 2]
Practice in the mirror
Brushing back a tear
Very sincere
A promising career could begin right here at home
If you've got that smug
That smug

[Chorus]
Hey mama, hey mama look at what your little babies all have become
Hey mama, hey mama, don't it ever make you wish you'd been a nun?
Vain and fickle, were we weaned on a pickle? Is it in our blood?
Rome is burning, we're here turning smug

[Verse 3]
Strike another pose
Power politics
Swallow their conventions
Get your power fix
We love to mud wrestle
We love to be politically Koreshed

[Verse 4]
Practice that smug
Post it like a man
One part Master Limbaugh
Two parts Madame Streisand
Now pretend you're in a band
My, my, we're looking smug
Very, very, very, very

[Chorus]
Hey mama, hey mama look at what your little babies all have become
Hey mama, hey mama, don't it ever make you wish you'd been a nun?
Vain and fickle, were we weaned on a pickle? Is it in our blood?
Rome is burning, we're here turning smug

[Verse 5]
All you smug-starved millions in the thick of the search
Welcome to our church
Whatcha wanna solve?
We can help you evolve
From merely self-righteous
To perfectly smug

[Verse 6]
Strike the proud pose of our country-club brethren
Friendly as a tomb
Fragrant as the bottom of a locker-room broom
Now what's the matter?
Hey, get off your knees
That part don't come 'til later
God will not be pleased

[Chorus]
Hey mama, hey mama look at what your little babies all have become
Hey mama, hey mama, don't it ever make you wish you'd been a nun?
Vain and fickle, were we weaned on a pickle? Is it in our blood?
Rome is burning, we're here turning smug

[Chorus]
Hey mama, hey mama look at what your little babies all have become
Hey mama, hey mama, don't it ever make you wish you'd been a nun?
Vain and fickle, were we weaned on a pickle? Is it in our blood?
Rome is burning, we're here turning
Rome is cooking, my, we're looking smug

[Outro: Phil Madeira]
I wanna talk today about smug people! They think they're so good. They ain't good! No, they ain't good at all, I tell you what! You wanna be a good man, you look at me! I'm gonna talk to you about humility--'cause I got it! I wanna talk to you about righteousness--'cause I got it! I'm good! I'm humble! I'm better than you! You wanna be a humble man, you look at me, you say, "Brother, how can I be humble?" I don't know how you can be humble! It took me a long time to get this way! But thank God I've arrived! Let's pray
