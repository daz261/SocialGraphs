Living with myself is hard enough
So I get away when things get rough
Famine, strife, and thoughts of war
Matter less than the dress she wore

You see, ignorance is bliss
Problem solved with just one kiss
Ignorance is bliss
Problem solved with just one kiss

I'm just trying to survive
Pay my bills and stay alive
All the world's problems ain't my fault
I take it all with a grain of salt

You see, ignorance is bliss
Problem solved with just one kiss
Ignorance is bliss
Problem solved with just one kiss

Ignorance is no excuse
Your problem's solved but what's the use
Ignorance is no excuse
The problem's solved then what's the use

I try to tell them every day
But nobody listens to a word I say
Look out my window, what do you see?
Sometimes it's worse than that stupid TV

Ignorance is bliss
Ignorance
Ignorance is bliss
Ignorance
Ignorance is bliss
Ignorance
Well, ignorance is bliss
Ignorance
