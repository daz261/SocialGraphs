Troubles, no troubles
On the line
And I can't stand to see you
I can't stand to see you
When you're crying at home

Scotch and penicillin
Please try Carlton
A cold black maple hangar
And husbands on the run

I just got back from a dream attack
That took me by surprise
And in there, I met a lady
Her name was Shady Sides

And she said

"It's been evening all day long
It's been evening all day long
And how can something so old
Be so wrong?"

Sin and gravity
Drag me down to sleep
To dream of trains across the sea
Trains across the sea

Half hours on earth
What are they worth?
I don't know

In 27 years
I've drunk fifty thousand beers
And they just wash against me
Like the sea into a pier...
