[Verse 1]
So many times I said it was forever
Said our love would always be true
Something in my heart always knew
I'd be lying there beside him

On my own, on my own, on my own
So many promises never should be spoken
Now you know what loving him costs
Now you're even talking divorce
And you weren't even married

On my own
Once again I'm
One more time by myself

No one said it would be easy
But it once was so easy
Well I believe in love now here I stand
You wonder why

[Chorus]
I'm on my own
Why did it end this way
On my own
This wasn't how it was supposed to be
On my own
I wish that we could do it all again

[Verse 2]
So many times I know I could have told you
That losing him would cut like a knife
He walked out and there went your life
I don't want to live without him

[Chorus]
I'm on my own
Why did it end this way
On my own
This wasn't how it was supposed to be
On my own
I wish that we could do it all again

I'm on my own
Why did it end this way
On my own
This wasn't how it was supposed to be
On my own
I wish that we could do it all again

[Outro]
You've got to find out where you belong again
Your hear is saying that it's time again
And I know you're going to shine again
