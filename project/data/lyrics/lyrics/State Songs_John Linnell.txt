The songs of the 50 states
The songs of the 50 states
The time has come for us to sing about a certain place
Where everything is in the control
Of people who are down in a hole

The songs of the 50 states
The songs of the 50 states
No two alike but each connected by a golden thread
I'll try not to forget all the words
And leave that job to those who have heard

State songs
State songs
I can't wait for my favorite one

I'm not gonna say they're great
I ain't gonna say they ain't
But I recall and will relate the words and music of the 50

Songs of the 50 states
The songs of the 50 states
The time is nigh for us to sigh about a certain place
Where everything is in the control
Of people who are under the ground

State songs
State songs
I can't wait for my favorite one

I hear the melody the harmony the pounding rhythm
The ideas, notes and words
Every state a different composition
Keeping me awake
Late at night
Can't get them out of my mind

State songs
State songs
I can't wait for my favorite one

I'm not gonna say they're great
I ain't gonna say they ain't
But I recall and will relate the words and music of the 50

Songs of the 50 states
The songs of the 50 states
The time has come for us to sing about a certain place
Where everything is in the control
Of men who are controlling my mind

State songs
State songs
I can't wait for my favorite one
