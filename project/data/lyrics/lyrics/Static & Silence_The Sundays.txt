[Verse 1]
You've stolen my heart and I want you to remember
Now what'll I do? living alone
You've stolen my heart and it hurts me to remember
Now where'll I go to? living alone

[Chorus]
And a butterfly in the wind is drifting like I do
It's dumb - I know what I want to say
But I can't even take one breath

[Verse 2]
As night falls I hear voices on the radio
(ooh) I'll follow their dreams
And wake up alone

[Outro]
And a butterfly in the wind is drifting like I do
It's dumb - I know what I want to say
But I can't even take one breath
So now still burning silently away
A storm without the thunder

 

[Verse 1]
Summer sky and a throat bone dry
And all the fields are all gold
Dusty lane with a song in my brain
And it stoned me to my soul

[Chorus]
I climb higher move towards the fire
Blaze sun

[Verse 2]
Silver trees and a whispering breeze
Are my sight and my sound
The thought of heaven couldn't drag me from the path
When i'm wandering here alone

[Chorus]
I climb higher move towards the fire
So blaze sun

[Outro]
Watch until it dies slow falling from the sky
Plae fading sun
