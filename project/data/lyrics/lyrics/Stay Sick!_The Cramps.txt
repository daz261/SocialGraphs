[Verse 1]
I woke up last night and I thought I was going to die (sick)
I woke up last night and I thought I was going to die (ooh, sick)
The doctor came a running and my family stood by (Well, say)

[Bridge 1]
He left three Bop Pills for ten, two and four
He left three Bop Pills for ten, two and four
Oh man, when they hit me, I landed in the middle of the floor (ah, sick)

[Chorus]
And I bopped and rocked and rolled like I never did before
And I bopped and rocked and rolled on every inch of that floor
Yeah, B-O-P, bop
Well, P-I-L-L-S
Bop pills

[Solo]

[Verse 2]
I went to see old doc and I couldn't get near his shack (oh loaded, man)
I went to see old doc and I couldn't get near his shack (yeah,sick)
They were crawlin' in the front door and bopping right on out the back (yeah, I'm telling you)

[Bridge 2]
I waited 8 long hours just to knock upon his door (yeah)
I waited 8 long hours just to knock upon his door
I came to pay my bills and brought money for a hundred more (ah, sick)

[Chorus]
And I bopped and rocked and rolled like I never did before
And I bopped and rocked and rolled on every inch of that floor
Yeah, B-O-P, bop
Well, P-I-L-L-S
Bop pills

 

[Verse 1]
I been a drag racer on LSD
And I rode bare-assed on top of the Sphinx
I even had a gorilla on the slopes of kismet
And man, that was fun for a while you bet, but

[Chorus]
Bikini girls with machine guns
Bikini girls with machine guns
Oh, this stuff will kill you
It's loaded with fun
Bikini girls with machine guns

[Verse 2]
Well I savored many foreign kinds of delicacies
Intoxicated 'til I can't tell what the hell I could see
Had all the violence and liquor within close reach
But all bars, pills and threeways lead me back to the beach and

[Chorus]
Bikini girls with machine guns
Bikini girls with machine guns
Oh, this stuff will kill you
It's loaded with fun
Bikini girls with machine guns

[Solo]

[Verse 3]
Now, they say that virtue is its own reward
But when that surf comes in I'm gonna get my board
I got my own ideas about the righteous kick
You can keep the reward, I'd just as soon stay sick

[Chorus]
Bikini girls with machine guns
Bikini girls with machine guns
Oh, this stuff will kill you
It's loaded with fun
Oh, bikini girls with machine guns

[Chorus]
Bikini girls with ma-
Bikini girls with ma-
Bikini girls with machine guns
Bikini girls with machine guns
Bikini girls with machine guns
Oh, bikini girls with machine guns
Bikini girls with machine guns
Oh, this stuff will kill you
It's loaded with fun
Bikini girls with machine guns

 

Well I been seein' red and singing the blues far back as I can tell
Til daisys gone from heaven and decorate the gates of hell
Now, you might believe the world is sweet and fine as sugar candy
But I myself believe in whatever comes in handy

Daisys up your butterfly
Daisys up your butterfly
Makes me up and wonder why
You got daisys up your butterfly

You're whistlin' past the graveyard, hopin' for the best
But a hum job after K-Mart just might wreck that party dress
Your poodle smokes, he'll probably choke and die in his own mink coat
Your rainbow's bringing rain that's gonna sink your damn love boat

Daisys up your butterfly
Daisys up your butterfly
Makes me up and wonder why
You got daisys up your butterfly

Well I been seein' red and singing the blues far back as I can tell
Til daisys came from heaven and decorate the gates of hell
Now, you might believe the world is sweet and fine as sugar candy
But I myself believe in whatever comes in handy

Daisys up your butterfly
Daisys up your butterfly
Makes me up and wonder why
You got daisys up your butterfly

Daisys up your butterfly
Maybe, maybe not
Could be daisys up your butterfly or a bad day at Black Rock

 

Well, no holes barred, watch your toes
Look out baby, everything goes

Ooooo
Everything goes
Well, goodness don't know
Everything goes

Yeah, you got your G-strings and gin and nylon hoes
Chicken pot pie, everything goes

Ooooo
Everything goes
Well, goodness don't know
Everything goes

Women swimmin' in chili down at smokey joe's
Hopped up hotheads, everything goes

Ooooo
Everything goes
Well, goodness don't know
Everything goes

Debbie had a donkey and two old crows
Said "look out baby, everything goes!"

Ooooo
Everything goes
Well, goodness don't know
Everything goes

Well, you can't get ahead by who you know
Kissy kissy, bang bang, everything goes

Ooooo
Everything goes
Well, goodness don't know
Everything goes

Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go
Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go
Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go
Let's go, let's go go go go, go man, go!
Well, goodness don't know
Everything goes

 

Hey, I'm on my way
On a journey outta this world
Hey, I'm on my way
On a journey outta this world
Swirling through the vortex to the center of a girl

Well, I've gotta rocket '88
Prone 269
Spinnin' around and down
Leavin' everything behind
Let go of the controls and
Slip outside my mind

Space begins to curve
Light begins to twist
Across a thigh of satin and
Through a veil of mist
There's a girl's netherworld
Lookin' for a kiss

So, hey, I'm on my way
On a journey outta this world
Hey, I'm on my way
On a journey outta this world
Swirling through the vortex to the center of a girl

I'm glidin' through this friction
Like some science fiction thrill
Gettin' off in these dimensions
Where time itself stands still
Flowin' through a whirlpool
To a she-feast wrapped in silk

Hey, I'm on my way
On a journey outta this world
Hey, I'm on my way
On a journey outta this world
Swirling through the vortex to the center of a girl

Hey, I'm on my way
On a journey outta this world
Hey, I'm on my way
On a journey outta this world
Swirling through the vortex to the center of a girl

Hey, I'm on my way
Hey, I'm on my way
Hey, I'm on my way
Hey, I'm on my way

Hey, I'm on my way

Hey, I'm on my way

 

Fatima had a fetish for a wiggle in her scoot
From her big tall heels on her big bad boots
She said saddle up a buzz buzz
Saddle up a buzz buzz
Saddle up a buzz buzz
Saddle up a buzz buzz

Tarzan drove a stingray on a fiberglass jungle
Swung from high tension wires and yelled down at the humble
Hey, saddle up a buzz buzz
Saddle up a buzz buzz
Saddle up a buzz buzz
Saddle up a buzz buzz buzz buzz

Rabid Rat Fink caught an eighty foot wave
Hit the bonsai pipeline and rode it straight to the grave
Screamin' saddle up a buzz buzz
Saddle up a buzz buzz
Saddle up a buzz buzz
Saddle up a buzz buzz

Callin' all KNIF's on a collision course
Don't let it bug you if you ain't got no horse
Whoa! Saddle up a buzz buzz
Saddle up a buzz buzz
Saddle up a buzz buzz
Saddle up a buzz buzz

Buzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
Rock it right
Buzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
Rock it right
Buzzzzzzzzzzzzzz

Saddle up a buzz buzz
Saddle up a buzz buzz
Saddle up a buzz buzz
Saddle up a buzz buzz

 

Well, good morning, Captain
Well, good morning to you
Do you need another mule skinner
Down on your new mud run
Ha, ha, hip, ee, ee.........

CHORUS
Well, I'm an old mule skinner
From down Kentucky way
And I can make any mule listen
Or I won't accept your pay
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
Hee, hee, hee, hee, hee, ha, ha
Well hey, hey

Little water boy, come here boy
Bring that water bucket around
Ha, ha, ha
If you don't like your job
Water boy, put that bucket down
Ha, ha, ha, ee, ee, ha, ha, ha

 

[Verse 1:]
The warden threw a party in the county jail
The prison band was there and they began to wail
The band was jumping and the joint began to swing
You should've heard those knocked out jailbirds sing

[Chorus:]
Let's rock, everybody, let's rock
Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancing to the Jailhouse Rock

[Verse 2:]
Spider Murphy played the tenor saxophone
Little Joe was blowing on the slide trombone
The drummer boy from Illinois went crash, boom, bang
The whole rhythm section was the Purple Gang

[Chorus:]
Let's rock, everybody, let's rock
Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancing to the Jailhouse Rock

[Verse 3:]
Number forty-seven said to number three
"You're the cutest jailbird I ever did see
I sure would be delighted with your company"
She said "come on and do the Jailhouse Rock with me"

[Chorus:]
Let's rock, everybody, let's rock
Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancing to the Jailhouse Rock

[Verse 4:]
The sad sack was a sitting on a block of stone
Way over in the corner weeping all alone
The warden said, "Hey, buddy, don't you be no square
If you can't find a partner use a wooden chair"

[Chorus:]
Let's rock, everybody, let's rock
Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancing to the Jailhouse Rock

[Verse 5:]
Shifty Henry said to Bugs, "For Heaven's sake
No one's looking, now's our chance to make a break"
Bugsy turned to Shifty and he said, "Nix nix
I want to stick around a while and get my kicks."

[Chorus:]
Let's rock, everybody, let's rock
Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancing to the Jailhouse Rock

[Outro]
Dancing to the Jailhouse Rock
Dancing to the Jailhouse Rock
Dancing to the Jailhouse Rock
Dancing to the Jailhouse Rock

Jackyard backoff
Jackyard backoff

[Verse 1]
It's just another red hot night back at the go go lounge
Her spiked heels sank into that penetration sound
Cootchie-cootchie-coo, feels so good it's killing me
Help [?] ... the police for the ... [?]

[Chorus]
She's going to
Jackyard backoff
Jackyard backoff
Jackyard backoff
Jackyard backoff

[Verse 2]
Well, she done ... [?] across the ocean
From the perfume fields of France

Just about half of me ... [?] take like this
Hey ... [?] baby ... [?] a little kiss

[Chorus]
Jackyard backoff

Jackyard backoff
Jackyard backoff

[Solo]

[Chorus]
Back off now
Jackyard backoff
Jackyard backoff

Yeah, that girl knows how to ride

She's some kind of hold on me that i just can't abide

[Chorus]
She's going to
Jackyard backoff
Jackyard backoff
Jackyard backoff
Jackyard backoff
