Let it all go, let it all go (x 4)

Twisting turning with your body
Easy
Feel free
And then go a little crazy
Never slip and slide
Take it easy
Move and glide
Take you on a little ride
Onto a dancehall vibe
Here we go with the flow
Let your love go
Brother
Don't smother
Your lover
Cause I'm going under cover
What's going on in this world today
As I lay on my bed
I pray
Oh, by the way

E17 ah yes here we go
Sounds of the bass
Now go with the flow
Free your mind your body and Soul
And let the music take control
Let it all go, let it all go
Let it all go
To a tempo roll and rumble
Never tumble
Cause you know I never stumble
Cool and humble
I buzz you like a bumble bee

Let it all go, let it all go (x 4)
Let it all go, let it all go, we're gonna rock ya, we're gonna rock ya (x 4)

E17 ah yes here we go
Sounds of the bass
Now go with the flow
Free your mind your body and Soul
And let the music take control
Let it all go, let it all go
Let it all go
To a tempo roll and rumble
Never tumble
Cause you know I never stumble
Cool and humble
I buzz you like a bumble bee

(Chorus)
Hands up getcha hands up
Don't drop 'em
Rhythms are rollin' and you know
You can't stop 'em
We got the groove to make you move
Dance take a chance
Try and escape
We're gonna getcha
Heartbeats faster
Dance a lot longer
Hardcore master beats a lot stronger
Feeling the hunger
Coming at ya
With the Jungle hardcore
Ruff like chainsaw

(Chorus)
