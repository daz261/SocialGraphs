Let's die tonight you know I'm right
I've got the feeling strong enough
To break 10,000 souls apart

I'm injecting my life into your veins
No experience to strong this pain

Pain in life cuts like a knife
Open the book of empty pages
What do you see?

I'm the master of pain
Waiting in vain
My pride is slain
Watch me die
During a sadistic lullabye

A gathering of long lost souls
Are carrying my memories written in the name of pain
I love to hear their veins screaming for more
Vengeance is the law exploding music
You can't catch time, it doesn't exist
Life's a sculpture that can't resist

I'm the master of pain
Waiting in vain
My pride is slain
Watch me die
During a sadistic lullabye

Engaged with destiny my life is yours
But you don't know me
We bleed together
Like an ever flowing stream
With souls so black oh so empty

Sadistic lullabye

 

Absorbed in life's eternal wheel
Feel the energy flow within

Energy in which you most certainly need
No one can bring you down

A chance to be spinning in dreams
Exists in your inner fantasy

I wanna search beyond
I wanna search for inner peace
I wanna dig a hold deep down
To find my inner need

Welcome to a bright engage
Face the light of inner rage

Energy in which you most certainly need
No one can bring you down

Inhale a breeze of passion
And sink deep into the well of life

I wanna search beyond
I wanna search for inner peace
I wanna dig a hold deep down
To find my inner need

Energy in which you most certainly need
No one can bring you down

Absorbed in life's eternal wheel
Feel the energy flow within

Energy in which you most certainly need
No one can bring you down
