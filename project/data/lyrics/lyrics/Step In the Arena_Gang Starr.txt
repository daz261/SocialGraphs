Step up

[Verse 1: Guru]
Once you step in the arena, cheater; you're gonna be a-
Mazed when you gaze at the armor on this leader
Fully clad and glad to fight a cause, I won't pause
Fear is a joke, slowpoke, I'm like claws
That'll rip 'cause your gift is merely flesh
Superficial and I wish you would give it a rest
But if you don't, I'll unsheath my Excalibur
Like a noble knight, so meet your challenger
A true hero, while you're a true zero
Gettin' beat to a pulp so that you can't run for help
I heard a gulp in your throat 'cause you hope that I'll be merciful
But coo-cluck, I made you strut as I rehearse a few
Battle drills, and watch your bladder spill
Yellow fluid, check how I mellowly do it
Face defeat to this beat, you can tell I'm into it
As I'm pullin' out my lance to kill you and advance to
The winner's throne; 'cause I own you once you step in the arena

[Scratches: DJ Premier]
Step up

[Verse 2: Guru]
In the arena... or rather coliseum
There's people gatherin' by multitudes to see one
Perpretrator fall to the dust after the other
Quickly disposed of at the hand of a known brother
Born with the art in his heart that is Spartacus
And one-to-one combat Jack, just a thought of this
Match-up makes Gang Starr wanna snatch up
One or two phrases from the new book with new pages
Of rhymes that are built like a chariot
Dope vocals carry it to the battle set
If a beat was a princess, I would marry it
But now I must bow to the crowd as I stand proud
Victorius, glorious, understand now
'Cause battles and wars and much fights I have been through
One MC got beheaded, and you can too
Forget it, 'cause you'd rather be just a spectator
An onlooker, afraid you may get slayed
Or struck by a blow from a mic gladiator
I betcha that later you might be sad that you played yourself
'Cause you stepped up, chest puffed out
And in just one lyric, you got snuffed out
'Cause rhymin' is serious, I'm strong, I'm like Hercules
You'll get hurt with these lines, close the curtains please
And suckers can jet 'cause I wreck once you step in the arena

[Scratches: DJ Premier]
Step inside my arena

[Verse 3: Guru]
In the arena or forum, weak MCs, I will floor 'em
Causin' mayhem, I'll slay them, and the blood'll be pourin'
Furthermore I implore that as a soldier of war
I go in only to win and be the holder of more
Trophies, titles, and triumphs 'cause I dump all the sly chumps
Never choosin' to lose my spot, not once
For the mere idea of an opponent that I'd fear
Is foolish utterly, I mean, what nut'd be
Tryin' to toy with a destroyer of many
You shitted your pants 'cause you can't think of any
Foe that could step to this concept so
You better sit again, citizen; weak MC's, I get rid of them
Watch the way they get distraught when they get caught
In the worst positions 'cause they didn't listen
And tried goin' up against a hungry killer who's itchin'
To maim and murder, those who claimed that they were the
Toughest ones, they get done once they step in the arena

Step inside my arena

[Verse 1: Guru]
Tell me, do you have a clue of what to do?
Can you groove to this smooth tune? You must presume
It's important for you to follow this creation
And hey son, life is more than having fun
So run and get some help with the problems that you face
Take a taste of the bass, put your perspective in place
Get real deep, so you can keep involved
Revolve and solve, so you can make the calls
Like a supervisor, he who is wiser than the others
'Cause they need someone to advise them to discover
Things that they don't know so the papers I will check
Then they'll start to grow to this form of intellect

[Hook: Cuts]
Individual with intellect

[Verse 2: Guru]
When the road is too steep, do you have the stamina
First album took us two weeks, since then we have been plannin'
An exclusive attraction conducive to your satisfaction
Those of you lackin', we will put you back in your slot
So you can think and get a grip of
Yourself by yourself, and then you'll get a sip of
A gift that's equipped with the script that shocks
You can take a walk on God
With your mouth wide open, hoping you can find a
Way to display similar actions in a kind of mockery
'Cause you don't realize the cost to be
Creative genius please, I'm too clean to play
Glance per chance, watch Gang Starr perfect
And dance your pants like champs, to this form of intellect

[Hook: Cuts]
Man with intellect

[Verse 3: Guru]
Valuable solutions we invent here
Break and remake the cupcakes to show we've been sent here
To serve you so swallow this and bite it
And why bring ignorance when we're inviting
You to get advancement, while you're on the dance tip
And don't you know the transcript will make you shake hips
Or chill at will, and with skill you'll learn some etiquette
Better get the subject or be last at the predicate
And get a set of headphones and speakers
As lyrical lessons manifest I will keep you
Abreast of the best in this rap mess
Oversaturated market full of wackness
I'm gifted, unlimited rhymes, universal
The Guru, nursing you with a verse spilled
Don't choke, and don't turn blue in a frenzy
Premier's severe, on the steel wheels he lends me
Spontaneous cuts, but not mainly just that
It's the scratching format, exact with maddening accuracy
Craftily, on the side or in back of me
Nastily, as if his name was Dick Dastardly
Original so get it yo the Gang gets respect
The chain and the star is a symbol, of this form of intellect
