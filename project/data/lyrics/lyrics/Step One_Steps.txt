[Verse 1]
There was something in your voice
That was telling me don't be too sure
Arousing my suspicions
I have never felt before

[Refrain]
I thought we had it made
I thought you'll never go away

[Chorus]
But now you're suddenly like a stranger
And you're leaving our love behind
Of all the things I was every planning for
This was the last thing on my mind

[Verse 2]
When I looked into your eyes
There was something you weren't telling me
But in my confusion I just couldn't see

[Refrain]
If there was any doubt
I thought we would work it out

[Chorus]
But now you're suddenly like a stranger
And you're leaving our love behind
Of all the things I was every planning for
This was the last thing on my mind

[Bridge]
There was something in your voice
That was telling me don't be too sure
Arousing my suspicions
I have never felt before

[Refrain]
I thought we had it made
I thought you'll never go away

[Chorus]
But now you're suddenly like a stranger
And you're leaving our love behind
Of all the things I was every planning for
This was the last thing on my mind

[Chorus]
But now you're suddenly like a stranger
And you're leaving our love behind
Of all the things I was every planning for
This was the last thing on my mind
