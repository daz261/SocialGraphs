When you find you can't somehow
Make it like all the rest
You won't need to scrounge around for someone else

Torn between the unknown
And the place that you call home
And the life you want but have never known

There was a time
You could put it out of your mind
Leave it all behind
There was a time
That time is gone

What has life for fifty years
In this town done for you
Except to earn your name and place on a barstool?

You spent your whole life in this county
You've never been out of state
You say, you're gonna make it out before it's too late

There was a time
You could put it out of your mind
Leave it all behind
There was a time
That time is gone

There was a time when nothing seemed to make much sense
That's turned more intense
And all the crutches you've kept around
Now are nowhere to be found

Remember when you didn't have
To look ahead or behind you
There was always something right there to do

But now it's life in some kind
Of trap looking for a way out
Well, you keep moving on, that's what it's all about

There was a time
You could put it out of your mind
Leave it all behind
There was a time
That time is gone

 

Disengaged, we're forsaken now
Communication does suffer
The moral stare of big brother
Not a chance, no compromise
Battling the barrier of belief not to try anymore

Don't want to murder the only memory or hide
Try to accept that it's all worthwhile
When you've been disengaged
Severed from any world that's mine

You can hang the blame on the wall
It'll be a frame around us all
Deluged by stickers and billboards
The conversation turns to war
Never thought it would come down to this
It seems every person for themself

Don't want to murder the only memory or hide
Try to accept that it's all worthwhile
When you've been disengaged
Severed and forsaken
When you've been disengaged
Severed from any world that's mine

More and more makes a hunger for less
You get hurt when you touch the bright lights burning
When you're high, you can fall down easy

Too many years spent trigger happy at times I feel betrayed
I feel that I've been wronged
Suspended in it all, disbelief
Until it seems it just can't go on
