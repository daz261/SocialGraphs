I'm gonna leave this place tomorrow
I'm gonna leave this town behind
I'll be gone before the morning
On the other side of the mound
That's why I'm moving on
I'm moving on
I've been hanging around too long
It's time I was moving on

I've been tired of the same old faces
And I'm sick of the same old names
I'm getting bored with the same old places
Everybody starts to look the same
That's why I'm moving on
I'm moving on
I've been hanging around too long
It's time I was moving on

I've been trying to settle down here
But my feet just won't stay still
And I heard that the grass is greener
On the other side of the hill
That's why I'm moving on
I'm moving on
I've been hanging around too long
It's time I was moving on
Give me one more for the road!

I'm gonna leave this town tomorrow
I'm gonna leave this place behind
You can bet your bottom dollar
All my troubles will be far behind
That's why I'm moving on
I'm a-moving on
I've been hanging around too long
It's time I was moving on
I've been hanging around too long
It's time I was moving on
Said I've been hanging around too long
It's time I was moving on
Wow! Get out of here!

 

You know I love you
You know it's true
I'll give you all my love, babe
What more can I do

I'm walking by myself
I hope you understand
I just want to be your lovin' man

I love you
Yes I love you with my heart and soul
I wouldn't mistreat you
For my weight in gold

I said I'm walking by myself
I hope you understand
I just want to be your lovin'
I just want to be your lovin'
I just want to be your lovin' man
That's right

 

It's the darkest hour
Of the darkest night
It's a million miles
From the morning light
Can't get no sleep
Don't know what to do
I've got those midnight blues

When the shadows fall
I feel the night closin' in
There must be some reason
For this mood I'm gettin' in
Can't get no sleep
Don't know what to do
I've got those midnight blues

Every evening after sundown
As the light begins to fade
I feel so low, but I just don't know
Why these blues won't go away

Every evening after sundown
As the light begins to fade
I feel so low, but I just don't know
Why these blues won't go away

It's the darkest hour
Of the darkest night
It's a million miles
From the morning light
Can't get no sleep
Don't know what to do
I've got those midnight blues

I've got those midnight blues
I've got those midnight blues
I've got those midnight blues

 

She's that kind of woman
No doubt about how she feels
She's holding promises
Her eyes won't tell
Her lips are sealed
And I like her like that
She's kind of crazy
I think I know what I'm looking for
That kind of woman
I think I know what I'm looking for
That kind of woman

Standing in the doorway
With the sunlight in her hair
She's watching the wind blow
You know she don't have a care
I like her like that
She's kind of crazy
I think I know what I'm looking for
That kind of woman
I think I know what I'm looking for
That kind of woman

She's got to look so cool
You know what I mean
Got the wickedest smile that I've ever seen
I'd crash my heart on the side of the street
That she once stood on
She's that kind of woman

I like her like that
She's pretty amazing
I understand why I want some more
Of that kind of woman
One look from hell knocks me on the floor
That kind of woman

She's that kind of lady
That you meet in a dream of dreams
Put others in shadows
But you know this woman's real
And I like her like that
She's kind of crazy
I think I know what I'm looking for
That kind of woman
I think I know what I'm looking for
That kind of woman
I think I know what I'm looking for
That kind of woman

I said I know what I'm looking for
That kind of woman
That kind of woman
That kind of woman
