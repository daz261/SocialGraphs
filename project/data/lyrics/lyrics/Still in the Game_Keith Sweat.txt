[Intro]
The rumor in the street, baby, girl
Is that you're leavin' me
After all I've done for you
How could you leave me
Baby, all your girlfriends say
That you're leavin' me
After all I've done for you
How could you leave me

[Verse 1]
Everybody's talkin' and the word is on the street
That you're playin' games and sayin' things like you're leavin' me [Mmm]
I don't know just what to do after all the things that we've been through
It should have come to you, and thought that you won't play just like a fool [Mmm, hmm]

[Pre-Chorus]
Your so-called girlfriends would never lie on you [No, no]
So everything they say, girl, it must be true
You got me lying here, oh, baby, by myself
The rumor in the street, you're with somebody else

[Chorus]
The rumor in the street, baby, girl
Is that you're leavin' me (The rumor in the street is that you're leavin' me)
After all I've done for you
How could you leave me (After all I done for you, my, my, my, baby)
Baby, all your girlfriends say
That you're leavin' me (All your girlfriends said that you're leavin' me)
After all I've done for you
How could you leave me (Oh, yeahyeah)

[Verse 2]
Now you got another lover tryin' to take my place
You can try to hide it all you want, it's written [Mmm] on your face [Mmm]
Now I'm sad and lonely because I thought I was your only
But you run behind my back, now tell me how you gonna act

[Pre-Chorus]
You had those proper things and, baby, diamond rings
Anything for you, oh, girl, I wouldn't do [Uh-huh]
Now I'm lying here, oh, baby, by myself
The rumor in the street, you're with somebody else

[Chorus]
The rumor in the street, baby, girl
Is that you're leavin' me (The rumor in the street is that you're leavin' me)
After all I've done for you
How could you leave me (After all I done for you, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh)
Baby, all your girlfriends say
That you're leavin' me (All your girlfriends said that you're leavin' me)
After all I've done for you (Oh, baby)
How could you leave me (Ohoh'oh'yeah')

[Bridge]
Mmm
[Yeah, yeah]
Yeah, yeah, oh

[Chorus]
The rumor in the street, baby, girl
Is that you're leavin' me (The rumor in the street is that you're leavin' me)
After all I've done for you
How could you leave me (How could you leave me, oh, yeah)
Baby, all your girlfriends say
That you're leavin' me (All your girlfriends said that you're leavin' me, oh, yes, they are)
After all I've done for you
How could you leave me (How could you leave me, girl, oh'ohohoh')
The rumor in the street, baby, girl
Is that you're leavin' me (The rumor in the street is that you're leavin' me)
After all I've done for you
How could you leave me

 

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, oh, talk to me
Come into my bedroom
Come on
Come on
Come into my bedroom
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Do you remember
The time we spent lovin each other
How much it meant
You'd said we'd never
Never intended to fall apart
But you left me
You really broke my hear
I tried to play you
But you played me first
It was so foolish oh how it hurt
I think about you each and every day
Ohhh baby, hear these words I say

[Chorus]
Can we make love for old time sake?
I remember girl the love we used to make
You were mine before you were his
Bring it on, bring it on, bring it on

[Verse 2]
As I sit and while my eyes
I begin to question why
Ask myself what went wrong
Why we didn't last for long
You blame me and I blame you
There was nothin left to do
If we woulda thought it out
We prolly coulda worked it out
Now you don't belong to me
I think about you constantly
What am I supposed to do
I musta been a damn fool
To let your lovin slip away
I think about you every day
I must have been crazy... to let you get away

[Chorus]
Can we make love for old time sake?
I remember girl the love we used to make
You were mine before you were his
Bring it on, bring it on, bring it on

[Outro]
He don't love you right
I know he don't hold you tight
Girl I know what you like
Oh yeah...
Can we make love?
Can we make love?
Can we make love?
Come on, come on
