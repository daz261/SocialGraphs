[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
I wanna be part of the programme
I wanna be part of the whole damn thing
I say, "Minimum effort, maximum gain."
From the inside out it all looks the same
Makin' me feel stronger
Makin' me feel like the Hulk I'll be king-size

[Chorus]
Here it is
I'll stake my claim and I'll be first to warn you
Here it is
I think the Devil lives in California

[Verse 2]
"Check out the freak", I'm laughing
Excuse me, are you talking to me?
I say, "Minimum effort, maximum gain."
From the inside out it all looks the same
Makin' me feel harder
Makin' me feel like the Hulk I'll be king-size

[Chorus]
Here it is
I'll stake my claim and I'll be first to warn you
Here it is
I think the Devil lives in California (Awe, yeah)
Here it is
I'll stake my claim and I'll be first to warn you (Yeah)
Here it is
I think the Devil lives in California

[Post-Chorus]
I'm on a mission, I'm on a mission
For my survival, my king-size position
I'm on a mission, in my condition
Outside my world I know there's no place like home
I'm on a mission, my king-size position
Outside my world I know there's no place like home
I can't stop my life from crashing
Out of control, I'm out of control
Nothing to fear but fear itself and me

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
I'd never sell
I'd never sell my soul for something
I never did a goddamn thing 'cause
I'd never sell my soul for something that's free
Minimum effort, maximum gain
From the inside out it all looks the same
Minimum effort, maximum gain
From the inside out it all looks the same
Nothing to fear but fear itself and
Nothing to fear but fear itself and
"Check out the freak", and I'm still laughing
Nothing to fear, but fear itself and me

[Chorus]
Here it is
I'll stake my claim and I'll be first to warn you
Here it is
I think the Devil lives in California (Awe, yeah)
Here it is
I'll stake my claim and I'll be first to warn you (Yeah)
Here it is
I think the Devil lives in California

[Outro]
I'm on a mission!
