Black as night black as life
Hungry for some of that easy life
Stony cold and a twistin' moon
Live it fast you're gonna get there soon

Look out world 'cause we know how to fight
Someone's gonna get shot tonight

Black eyed blonde and a blonde eyed black
Come from hell and we won't be back
I'm in your blood and I'm in your bones
Better dead than to be stuck alone

Look out world cause here she comes
Suckin' on her painted thumbs

Hey, it's ok I will never go away
Hey, it's alright when the
Day turns into night

 

[Hope Sandoval]
I gave you all I had
I gave you good and bad
I gave but you just threw it back

[Jim Reid]
I won't get on my knees
Don't make me do that please
I've been away but now I'm back

[Hope Sandoval]
Don't be too sure of that
What makes you sure of that
You went away you can't come back

[Jim Reid]
I walked away from you
I hurt you through and through
Aw honey give me one more chance

[Hope Sandoval]
Aw you're a lucky son
Lucky son of a gun
You went away, you went away
You went away but now you're back

[Jim Reid]
I got down on my knees
And then I begged you please
I always knew you'd take me back
