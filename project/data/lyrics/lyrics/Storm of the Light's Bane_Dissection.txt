[Verse 1]
Pain, plague an pestilence shall sweep through your sight
Grim is the truth that hides behind the fading light
The eyes of the beholder stares empty silent and cold
For the deeds of the dark ones are fearful to behold

[Chorus]
With liftened dreadful swords
We swear allegiance to our lord
We're the unhallowed
Usurpers of the throne

[Verse 2]
Dusk will bring the gathered ones upon the feeble men of god
Superior mighty warriors of pure unhallowed blood
Shoulder to shoulder they reign in the darkest of nights
Together at the edge of time, brought forth to slay the light

[Bridge]
Thy majesty - our majesty
Sole superior evil itself
We'll be your instrument
And the blade of their damnation

[Verse 3]
So futile humans on the knees for the Satanized
Burning high at the stakes with the love of Christ

[Verse 4]
Do not rest in peace, may your souls all burn black
Your sons and daughters I will kiss....with a poisoned smile
Sing out the pain of your roots that you cannot deny
And we'll crush your worthless prayers of the weak forgotten lie

[Verse 5]
The apocalypse is here, oh fools of the withering sky
Encounter darkness as you fall into the endless fire
The jaws of darkness, open wide, lost souls scream out in vain
All will writhe eternity's perpetual infernal pain

[Chorus]
With liftened dreadful swords
We swear allegiance to our lord
We're the unhallowed
Usurpers of the throne
