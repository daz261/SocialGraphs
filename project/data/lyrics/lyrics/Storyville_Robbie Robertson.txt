Soldier of fortune
He's a man of war
Just can't remember
What he's fighting for
Start a revolution
Right before your eyes
When you hear the big bang
Don't you be surprised

Showdown at big sky
Darkness at high noon
Showdown at big sky
That day may be soon

And people, people
Can you hear the sound
From every village and every town
Let the bells ring out (ring those bells)
Hear the bells ring in
Let the bells ring out (everybody)
Keep them ringing, ringing

Can't predict the future
Can't forget the past
Feels like any moment
Could be the last
All you believers
Standing inside this room
Can't you see it coming
Shooting out across the moon

Save this place
- In the valley of tears
- By the river of time
From weapons race
- In the Book of David
- In the holy night
When it's laid to waste
- It will be written
- By the children of Eden
I said save this place
- And the Holy Ghost

Showdown at big sky
Darkness at high noon
Showdown at big sky
That day may be soon

And people, people
Can you hear the sound
From every village and every town
Let the bells ring out (ring those bells)
Hear the bells ring in (ring those bells)
Let the bells ring out (everybody)
Keep them ringing, ringing

Save this place
- In the valley of tears
- By the river of time
From the weapons race
- In the Book of David
- In the holy night
When it's laid to waste
- It will be written
- By the children of Eden
I said save this place
- And the Holy Ghost
- And the Holy Ghost

Showdown at big sky
Darkness at high noon
Kiss tomorrow goodbye
And that day could be soon

Give us the strength
Give us the wisdom
And give us tomorrow

Let the bells ring out (ring those bells)
Hear the bells ring in
Let the bells ring out (oh those people)
Keep them ringing, ringing (ring those bells)
Let the bells ring out (ring out)
Hear the bells ring in (ring in)
Let the bells ring out (oh those people)
Keep them ringing, ringing (ring those bells)
Let the bells ring out
Hear the bells ring in
Let the bells ring out
Keep them ringing, ringing

 

Who else is gonna bring you a broken arrow
Who else is gonna bring you a bottle of rain
There he goes, moving across the water (that's right)
There he goes, turning my whole world around

Do you feel what I feel
Can we make that so it's part of the deal
I gotta hold you in these arms of steel
Lay your heart on the line...this time

I wanna breathe when you breathe
When you whisper like that hot summer breeze
Count the beads of sweat that cover me
Didn't you show me a sign, this time

Who else is gonna bring you a broken arrow
Who else is gonna bring you a bottle of rain
There he goes, moving across the water
There he goes, turning my whole world around

Can you see what I see
Can you cut behind the mystery
I will meet you by the witness tree
Leave the whole world behind

I want to come when you call
And I'll get to you if I have to crawl
They can't hold me with these iron walls
We've got mountains to climb

Who else is gonna bring you a broken arrow
Who else is gonna bring you a bottle of rain
There he goes, moving across the water (that's right)
There he goes, turning my whole world around
Turning my whole world around
Turning my whole world around
Turning my whole world around
