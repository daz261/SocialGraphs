And if my two left feet could settle down and split the difference
Tripping over myself in every way that I know how
Perhaps in time I could surpass my coy facade of vast indifference
But I've already reached the maximum of what my law allows
You tell me to relax you tell me
Not to try so hard
But in the end it only makes me want to more
To figure out some way to play some major part

So I watch her move and I watch her work
I satisfy my voyeuristic quirk
Old habits they are hard to break
Just harder than it is to take
And when she looks away I tap my feet
I try my best to be discreet
Iâ€™m careful so she won't find out
How much I want to shout

Come on and dance with me Felicia
And show me how to do that step I never thought I could
You always move so gracefully
And I was never any good
But maybe if you'll dance with me
I'd feel as nimble as a cheetah, Felicia
The momentary soaring of an eagle would be me
Come on, Felicia set me free
And when you start to close your eyes
You know you move so beautifully
I want to dance with you, come on and dance with me Felicia

I suppose the thing that gets me most is that if I'd bothered ever
I wouldn't feel so much like Casey who never got to bat
You cannot help but laugh at me singing better late than never
And more and more I realize I have no argument for that
I can almost work up the nerve for a declaration
I can almost hear me speak the words as I gain resolve
But then you move and you twirl and you smile at me
And my inhibitions and my courage both dissolve

And so I'm standing there and I do not move
In spite of her momentous groove
And for a moment I can barely see
A glimpse of how good it could be
And then I must admit that I want to try
To look Felicia in the eye
And when the music starts to play
To smile at her and say

Come on and dance with me Felicia
And show me how to do that step I never thought I could
You always move so gracefully
And I was never any good
But maybe if you'll dance with me
I'd feel as nimble as a cheetah, Felicia
The momentary soaring of an eagle would be me
Come on, Felicia set me free
And when you start to close your eyes
You know you move so beautifully
I want to dance with you, come on and dance with me Felicia

And so I'm standing there and I do not move
In spite of her momentous groove
And for a moment I can barely see
A glimpse of how good it could be
And then I must admit that I want to try
To look Felicia in the eye
And when the music starts to play
To smile at her and say

Come on and dance with me Felicia
And show me how to do that step I never thought I could
You always move so gracefully
And I was never any good
But maybe if you'll dance with me
I'd feel as nimble as a cheetah, Felicia
The momentary soaring of an eagle would be me
Come on, Felicia set me free
And when you start to close your eyes
You know you move so beautifully
I want to dance with you, come on and dance with me Felicia
I want to dance with you, come on and dance with me Felicia
Dance with me, I want to dance with you Felicia

 

Break away, break away
Blinkin and Nod
Carelessly with matches play
Telling you you're odd
Foolishly he lets it burn
Aware of different shapes
And so he makes his hand a fist
And never looks at what he rapes

And who am I to say I don't understand it?
And if feeling better justifies the thrill
Who'd be stupid enough to say it doesn't have to be that way?
I will

Sing a song of sixty pence
For a pocket full of rye
And kill all that he represents
To ensure that he will die
Chase him from the public square
Or hang him from a tree
And tell his kind they best beware
Because he's different from me

And who am I to say I don't understand it?
And if feeling better justifies the thrill
Who'd be stupid enough to say it doesn't have to be that way?
I will

Twinkle, twinkle little star
We have you in our sights
Dangerous, we come this far
The serpent giggles with delight
The pig's head on a stick does grin
As we teeter on the brink
He's singing "you are all my children"
My island's bigger than you think

And who am I to say I don't understand it?
And if feeling better justifies the thrill
Who'd be stupid enough to say it doesn't have to be that way?
I will
I will
I will
I will
