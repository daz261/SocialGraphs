There will come a time when everything will have to end
When all the wrong youve done will be your only friend
And as the clock runs down you start to lose control
No one can save you now because you sold your soul
God wants to know - what you thin think you're doing
God wants to know - what is it youve done
God wants to know - did you hear the warning
I want to know - will I be the one?

Chorus:
Judgement days here - now it's time to meet your maker
Judgement days here - heaven or hell one will take ya
Judgement days here - think about the life youve led
Judgement days here - yeah! Yeah!
Why do you try to hide, you can't escape your past
Youre not the first to sin and you will not be the last
Just do for others what you want done back to you
Cause if you're positive, God will see you through
Pre-chorus
The time is coming and the world is gonna blow
And only God decides exactly where well go
Take my advice and listen to the words I say
If you live righteous then your life will be okay
Pre-chorus
Chorus and chorus-out
