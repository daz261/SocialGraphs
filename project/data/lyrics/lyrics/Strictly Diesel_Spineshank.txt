Confide in you
Decide it's true

Forced on me and then (You don't like it)
Forced on me and then (You don't like it)
Forced on me and then (You don't like it)
Forced on me and then (You don't like it)

I break in two
Because of you

Forced on me and then (You don't like it)
Forced on me and then (You don't like it)
Forced on me and then (You don't like it)
Forced on me and then (You don't like it)

Seems to be a crime (And so you feed it more)
Seems to be a crime (And so you feed it more)
Seems to be a crime (And so you feed it more)
Seems to be

So sad, what if you don't like it?
(I just don’t care)
What if you don't like it?
(I just don't care)

So sad, what if you don't like it?
(I just don't care)
What if you don't like it?
(I just don't care, you lose)

You get it
You get it
You get it
You get it
You get it
You get it
You get it
Get it

Seems to be a crime (And so you feed it more)
Seems to be a crime (And so you feed it more)
Seems to be a crime (And so you feed it more)
Seems to be

So sad, what if you don't like it?
(I just don’t care)
What if you don't like it?
(I just don't care)

So sad, what if you don't like it?
(I just don't care)
What if you don't like it?
(I just don't care)
You lose

Don't lie to me
Don't lie to me
Don't lie to me
Don't lie to me

Don't lie (Lie)
Don't lie (Lie)
Don't lie (Lie)
Don't lie (Lie)
