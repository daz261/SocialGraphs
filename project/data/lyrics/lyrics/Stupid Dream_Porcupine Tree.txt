I remember piano lessons
The hours in freezing rooms
Cruel ears and tiny hands
Destroying timeless tunes
She said there's too much out there
Too much already said
You'd better give up hoping
You're better off in bed

You don't need much to speak of
No class, no wit, no soul
Forget your own agenda
Get ready to be sold
I feel now like Christine Keeler
Sleepwalking in the rain
I didn't mean to lose direction
I didn't want that kind of fame

Take your hands
Off my land

Credit me with some intelligence
If not, just credit me
I come in value packs of ten
In five varieties

And even though I got it all now
My only stupid dream
Is you and me together
And how it should have been
I remember piano lessons
Now everything seems clear
You, waiting under streetlights
For dreams to disappear

Credit me with some intelligence
If not, just credit me
I come in value packs of ten
In five varieties

Take your hands
Off my land

Credit me with some intelligence
If not, just credit me
I come in value packs of ten
In five varieties
Credit me with some intelligence
If not, just credit me
I come in value packs of ten
In five varieties

Credit me with some intelligence
I come in value packs of ten
