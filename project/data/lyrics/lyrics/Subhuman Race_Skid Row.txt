Sailing ships go through my mind
Past wreckage on the way
Glory seekers fall in line
Getting closer
Summer laugh, some will cry
What will summer bring!
Some will take her by the reins
And ride the suffering

(Bridge)
On a carousel through my yesterdays
Doubt sees the obstacles
Faith sees the way
(Repeat 2x)

(Chorus)
All the ways you kill me
They've begun to thrill me
Nothing there fulfills my firesign
Brotherhood betrayal
Sabotage to no avail
Nothing there can kill my firesign

Beaten, burned , I'll take the fall
And get up right in your face
Walk all over what I believe
But I'm still here, you disappear
Without a trace
No need to follow, no need to lead
No need to beg or borrow
I just need to be me

(Repeat Bridge 2x)

(Repeat Chorus 2x)
