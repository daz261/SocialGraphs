My tears fall like rain
From the longlasting pain
When I look at your eyes
My heart just dies

Beauty divine
I hope you'll be mine
Open your arms
For all time

All dressed in white
Bringer of light
Spend time with me
All through the night

Beauty divine
Your tears taste like wine
Come to me
For all time

My spine shivers with the touch of your lips...
My pale skin turns red when we kiss...
Piercing your nails deep into my back...
As I slowly kiss your ivory neck...

I started to cry after hours of joyful sin...
My tears turned to roses as they embraced your skin...
I gathered them to a bouquet of the most beautiful flowers...
A bouquet of the most secret and ancient powers...

My amber heart started to glow as I died really slow...

My tears fall like rain
From the longlasting pain
When I look at your eyes
My heart just dies

Beauty divine
I hope you'll be mine
Open your arms
For all time

All dressed in white
Bringer of light
Spend time with me
All through the night

Beauty divine
Your tears taste like wine
Come to me
For all time
