Do you, do you, do you wanna watch me?
Can you make them like to see me bleed?
Do you, do you wanna watch me?
Can you make them like to see me bleed?
Are we something you can pick apart?
Well, there's one more spot on the guest list

I asked you what time it was
Not how to make a watch
I asked you what time it was
Not how to make a watch

Every time I speak to you
I see your lies don't shine through
Every line you babble spoils
So get away from me because I hate your guts

I want, I want to rip off your best catch phrase
Smear your face across the music page
Gonna rip off your best catch phrase
Smear your face across the front page
Watch out cute girly girly girlfriend
The watchmaker is the watch watch watchmaker

I asked you what time it was
Not how to make a watch
I asked you what time it was
Not how to make a watch

Every time I speak to you
I see your lies don't shine through
Every line you babble spoils
So get away from me because I hate your guts

I don't speak loud enough you say
Is this loud enough for you?
We don't rock hard enough you say
Is this hard enough for you?
I don't talk smart enough you say
Is this smart enough for you?
I don't speak loud enough you say
Is this loud enough for you?

Tick tock watchmaker
She's a smart ass kicker
Tick tock watchmaker
She's a smart ass kicker
Tick tock watchmaker smart ass kicker
Find her tell her you're finally a watchmaker

I told you how to make a watch, how does it feel?
I told you how to make a watch, time to kill

Every time I speak to you
I see your lies don't shine through
Every line you babble spoils
So get away from me because I hate your guts

Tick tock watchmaker
Find her tell her you're finally a watchmaker
Tick tock
Tick tock
You're finally a watchmaker
