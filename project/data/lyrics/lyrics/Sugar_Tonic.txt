[Verse 1]
Love is tragic, love is bold
You will always do what you are told
Love is hard, love is strong
You will never say that you were wrong

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't know when I got bitter
But love is surely better when it's gone

[Chorus]
'Cause you wanted more
More than I could give
More than I could handle
In a life that I can't live
You wanted more
More than I could bear
More than I could offer
For a love that isn't there

[Verse 2]
Love is color, love is loud
Love is never saying you're too proud
Love is trusting, love is honest
Love is not a hand to hold you down

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't know when I got bitter
But love is surely better when it's gone

[Chorus]
'Cause you wanted more
More than I could give
More than I could handle
In a life that I can't live
You wanted more
More than I could bear
More than I could offer
For a love that isn't there

[Bridge]
I got to pick me up when I am down
I got to get my feet back on the ground
I got to pick me up when I am down

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't know when I got bitter
But love is surely better when it's gone

[Chorus]
'Cause you wanted more
More than I could give
More than I could handle
In a life that I can't live
You wanted more
More than I could bear
More than I could offer
For a love that isn't there

[Chorus 2]
You wanted more
More than I could love
More than I could offer
The harder you would shove
You wanted more
More than I could give
More than I could handle
In a life that I can't live
