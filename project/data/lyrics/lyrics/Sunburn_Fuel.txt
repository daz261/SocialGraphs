Seven sins of wantonness and
Everything that's good is gone
Sell it for the glory from the peers
Silicone priestess scratch the back and
Twists the knife to bone
Kick against the pricks and scrape the shins
I'm the enemy in the enemies now

Swallowed the pill
And drank to the fill
All these things I carry now
In this bittersweet, in this bittersweet now

Try to hold the world there sinking
Swimming in a paper cup
Try to own the one beneath the skin
Held up to the flame still singing
Skin begins to draw and tuck
Never told there's not a chance to win
What couldn't be, wouldn't be now

Swallowed the pill
And drank to the fill
All these things I carry now
In this bittersweet, in this bittersweet now

Bittersweet
Love is bittersweet

Hold your hands up to the sky and try
So hard to rise above
But everything is beating down

Swallowed the pill
And drank to the fill
All these things I carry now
In this bittersweet, in this bittersweet now

Swallowed the pill
And drank to the fill
All these things I carry now
In this bittersweet
In this bittersweet
In this bittersweet, now

 

[Verse 1]
She calls me from the cold
Just when I was low, feeling short of stable
And all that she intends
And all she keeps inside, isn't on the label
She says she's ashamed
Can she take me for a while?
And can I be a friend?
We'll forget the past
Or maybe I'm not able
And I break at the bend

[Chorus]
We're here and now
Will we ever be again?
'Cause I have found
All that shimmers in this world is sure to fade
Away again

[Verse 2]
She dreams a champagne dream
Strawberry surprise, pink linen and white paper
Lavender and cream
Fields of butterflies, reality escapes her
She says that love is for fools who fall behind
And I'm somewhere between
I never really know
A killer from a savior
'Til I break at the bend

[Chorus]
We're here and now
Will we ever be again?
'Cause I have found
All that shimmers in this world is sure to fade
Away again

[Refrain 1]
It's too far away for me to hold
It's too far away
It's too far away for me to hold
It's too far away
Ah oh

[Refrain 2]
Yeah, it's too far away for me to hold
It's too far away
Ah ah oh
It's too far away for me to hold
It's too far away
It's too far away for me to hold
It's too far away
Ah ah oh
It's too far away for me to hold
It's too far away

[Outro]
Guess I'll let it go
