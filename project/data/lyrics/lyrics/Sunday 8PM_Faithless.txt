[Intro: Maxi Jazz]
Beg you listen me, don't be kissin' me till I'm done
Unsung champion o' reason, like seasonin'
Pepper your thoughts with spice and entice you to a space
Where I dwell with bass players and layers and loops
Think what I think with my prayers, it's nice
My world is everything I've become
Contained in the hum between voice and drum
I'm comin' from the same place I'm-a still runnin' from
But even sittin' in the garden, one can still get stung

[Verse 1: Maxi Jazz]
Huh, I'm on Lonely Street, age nearly three
Recently mama's cryin' all the time, is it because of me?
Or my younger sister, even dad was weepin' when he kissed her
Face all puffy like a blister, cryin' like he missed her
Since we moved away from the house where we used to play
They say I'll understand one day, but I doubt it
Mama never say nothin' about it
How'd it get to be so crowded? I found it a strain
Everywhere I look I see pain
And I can't escape the feelin' maybe I'm to blame
So, I strain to listen, prayin' for a decision, wishin'
They were kissin', this feels like extradition or exile
Mama finds it hard to smile
So, I make pretend cups of coffee in her favorite style
She says, "Child, I'm workin' so there's nothin' you lack"
But she know I want my dad, I want my family back

[Verse 2: Maxi Jazz]
I'm on Lonely Street, age 43
Couldn't gauge when to quit so my wife quit me
Took offense, took the kids
I wish that was the end
But before she took her leave she took care of my best friend
Workin' all the hours, God send was not the tactic
You see, 'cause after ten years, I'm left with jackdish
Wanted to make the cash quick so I had to work real late
Bad sex, my woman's vex even if I stay awake
And if I'm honest, I had a lickle cake at the office
I was eatin'
We'd do our cheating over coffees
Makin' tea for the bosses
Makin' free with me
And I agree I got sleazy too easily
But I'm 43
This doesn't usually happen to me
Now I'm lonely
I'm wonderin' what my son's doin' today
Suddenly I'm blinkin' like the screen on my computer display
And I'm drinkin', concerned about what's down the track
If I don't get my family back

I want my family back, yeah

Mm, I want my family back

[Verse 3: Maxi Jazz]
Huh, I'm on Lonely Street, number 53
Boarded up properly
I'll probably get pulled down
Litter all around inside, there's no sound and no light
But yo, it gets busy at night
People creepin'
Derelicts sneakin' into fix
Speakin'
On the way my timbers creakin', roof leakin'
And bricks comin' loose
Knee high in refuse
But even though I'm a slum
I'm still of some use
Huh
There was a time when my walls were decorated
And under my roof children were educated
But now paint's faded, windows are all smashed
A crash in the economy robbed me of my family
And no strategy combats negative equity
So, that's it
Like violence it's drastic
I'm freakin' and seekin' to be more than just a house for crack
Somebody bring my family back
