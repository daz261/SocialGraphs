Break off a hunk of that brick for me baby
I'm gonna loose it now
You're gonna loose it now
We're all gonna loose it now

Well I've got these dimes for free
Step in to the back of my van
Swim through a lake of fire
Oh baby you're so fine fine fine

Well I've got more love and speed than your lonely souls can chew
And I'll lay it all on you
Cause I think that you want me to

Well I own every piece of earth And I made that hole in the sky
And I tell you when you can cry
And I tell you when to shut your eyes

We're all damned
I'm ape and god in one
A GTO from the stars
Mentalla's favorite son

So fuckin' run

I looked out my window
I saw a sea of naked meat
We were riding in the street
We were riding in the street yeah

Then I felt my head explode
And my mind was a mountain of weed
We are absolutely free
We are absolutely free

We're all damned
I'm ape and god in one
Apollo gave me doses baby
You're mother's favourite ones

We're all damned
I hate this perfect world
I'll climb atop this universe
And pound until it's gone
