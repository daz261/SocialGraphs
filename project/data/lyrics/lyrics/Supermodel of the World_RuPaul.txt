[Spoken Intro]
She's got her Gemini Mixer with the funky crossfader and her two 1200s just ready to let us have it

[Verse 1]
I walk into the joint
The club was jumping
People pumping
They was grooving to the sound
Shakin booties to the ground
I look up to the booth
To see who was tearin' off the roof
Much to my surprise she looked me dead in the eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
Hey!
Miss Lady DJ (Lady DJ)
Miss Lady DJ (Lady DJ)
Miss Lady DJ (Lady DJ)
Hey! Hey!

[Spoken Interlude 1]
Woo, girlfriend
Miss Messy
Aw yeah aw yeah

[Chorus]
Come on, lady
Set me free
Make it funky as you wanna be
Make my body step to the beat
Don't stop the music
You're moving me

[Verse 2]
She has the party jammin'
Spinning tunes that was slammin'
I feel it deep it with in
That woman put me in a frenzy
Frenzy

[Pre-Chorus]
Hey!
Miss Lady DJ (Lady DJ)
Miss Lady DJ (Lady DJ)
Miss Lady DJ (Lady DJ)
Hey! Hey

[Spoken Interlude 2]
Walk that way, walk that way, walk that way
Break it down
Right on
Miss Lady DJ baby

[Chorus]
Come on, lady
Set me free
Make it funky as you wanna be
Make my body step to the beat
Don't stop the music
You're moving me
Come on, lady
Set me free
Make it funky as you wanna be
Make my body step to the beat
Don't stop the music
You're moving me
