[Verse 1]
Stretch the bones over my skin
Stretch the skin over my hand
I'm going to the holy land
Stretch the marks over my eyes
Burn the candles deep inside
Yeah, you know where I'm coming from

[Chorus 1]
So give up to greed, you don't have to feed me, yeah
Give up to fate, you don't have to need me
So let it go, won't you let it go, won't you let it go
Won't you let it, drown me in you, yeah?

[Verse 2]
So slip down the darkness to the mouth
Damn the water, burn the wine
I'm going home for the very last time

[Chorus 2]
So throw it away, you don't have to take me, yeah
Make no mistake, I am what you make me
So let it go, won't you let it go, won't you let it go
Won't you let it, drown me in you?
Drown me in you
Drown me in you
Drown me in you
Drown me in...
Drown me in...
Oh, drown me in...
Yeah, drown me in...
Yeah

[Bridge]
I see you turn around and burning down
The feeling starts to sink
I feel the hurt surround me
Please dissolve me
She's resolved to be

[Verse 3]
So, heal my wound without a trace
And seal my tomb without my face
I'm going to the lonely place

[Chorus 1]
So give up to greed, you don't have to feed me, yeah
Give up to fate, you don't have to need me
So let it go, won't you let it go, won't you let it go
Won't you let it, drown me in you?

Drown me in you
Drown me in you
Drown me in you
Drown me in you
Drown me in you
Drown me in you
Drown me in you
Drown me in...

 

Yeah

[Verse 1]
Take, if you want a slice, if you want a piece
If it feels alright
Break, if you like the sound, if it gets you up
If it takes you down
Share, if it makes you sleep, if it sets you free
If it helps you breathe

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't come over here and piss on my gate
Save it, just keep it off my wave

[Verse 2]
Cry, if you want to cry, if it helps you see
If it clears your eyes
Hate, if you want to hate, if it keeps you safe
If it makes you brave
Pray, if you want to pray, if you like to kneel
If you like to lay

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't come over here and piss on my gate
Save it, just keep it off my wave

[Chorus]
Keep it off my wave
Keep it off my wave, my wave
Keep it off my wave, keep it off my wave
Keep it off my wave, my wave
My wave, my wave, my wave, my wave, my wave

[Verse 3]
Cry, if you want to cry, if it helps you see
If it clears your eyes
Hate, if you want to hate, if it keeps you safe
If it makes you brave
Take, if you want a slice, if you want a piece
If it feels alright

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't come over here and piss on my gate
Save it, just keep it off my wave

[Chorus]
Keep it off my wave
Keep it off my wave, my wave
Keep it off my wave, keep it off my wave
Keep it off my wave, my wave
My wave, my wave, my wave, my wave
My wave, my wave, my wave, my wave, my wave
Keep it off my wave
Keep it off my wave, my wave

[Outro]
Keep it off my wave
Keep it off my wave
Keep it off my wave
Keep it off my wave
Keep it off, keep it off
Keep it off my wave
Keep it off, keep it off
Keep it off my wave
