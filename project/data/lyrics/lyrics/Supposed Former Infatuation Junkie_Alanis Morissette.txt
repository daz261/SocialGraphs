[Verse 1]
I've seen them kneel with bated breath for their ritual
I've watched this experience raise them to pseudo higher levels
I've watched them leave their families in pursuit of your nirvana
I've seen them coming to line up from Switzerland and America

[Chorus]
How long will this take, baba?
And how long have we been sleeping?
Do you see me hanging on to every word you say?
How soon will I be holy?
How much will this cost, guru?
How much longer till you completely absolve me?

[Verse 2]
I've seen them give their drugs up in place of makeshift altars
I've heard them chanting "Kali Kali" frantically
I've heard them rotely repeat your teachings with elitism
I've seen them boasting robes and foreign sandalwood beads

[Chorus]
How long will this take, baba?
How long have we been sleeping?
Do you see me hanging on to every word you say?
How soon will I be holy?
How much will this cost, guru?
How much longer till you completely absolve me?

[Bridge]
Ave Maria
Ave Maria
Ave Maria
Ave Maria

[Verse 3]
I've seen men overlooking God in their own essence
I've seen their upward glances in hopes of instant salvation
I've seen their righteousness mixed without loving compassion
I've watched you smile as the students bow to kiss your feet

[Chorus]
How long will this take, baba?
How long have we been sleeping?
Do you see me hanging on to every word you say?
How soon will I be holy?
How much will this cost, guru?
How much longer till you completely absolve me?
Give me strength, all-knowing one
How long 'til enlightenment?
How much longer until you completely absolve me?

[Outro]
Ave Maria
Ave Maria
Ave Maria
Ave Maria

 

[Verse 1]
How 'bout getting off of these antibiotics
How 'bout stopping eating when I'm full up
How 'bout them transparent dangling carrots
How 'bout that ever elusive kudo

[Chorus 1]
Thank you India
Thank you terror
Thank you disillusionment
Thank you frailty
Thank you consequence
Thank you, thank you silence

[Verse 2]
How 'bout me not blaming you for everything
How 'bout me enjoying the moment for once
How 'bout how good it feels to finally forgive you
How 'bout grieving it all one at a time

[Chorus 1]
Thank you India
Thank you terror
Thank you disillusionment
Thank you frailty
Thank you consequence
Thank you, thank you silence

[Bridge]
The moment I let go of it
Was the moment I got more than I could handle
The moment I jumped off of it
Was the moment I touched down

[Verse 3]
How 'bout no longer being masochistic
How 'bout remembering your divinity
How 'bout unabashedly bawling your eyes out
How 'bout not equating death with stopping

[Chorus 2]
Thank you India
Thank you providence
Thank you disillusionment
Thank you nothingness
Thank you clarity
Thank you, thank you silence

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah
Oh, oh, oh-oh
No, oh, oh, oh
No, oh, oh, oh
