No gold worth digging for
Without your golden love
No treasure rich enough
To be without your love
No sorrow deeper than
To be away from you
No distance farther than
A night not spent with you
No diamond brighter than
The light within your eyes
No star I gaze at
Brighter in these skies
No sadness deeper than
This longing for you
I'd give it all up
To be with you
This night of darkness
I lay upon my bed
All alone and lonely
Remembering words you said
No goal worth striving for
Without your golden smiles
Never again we'll part
No more the lonely miles
