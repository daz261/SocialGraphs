Your kingdom is of emptiness
Invisible empire of illusion
There's no majesty in your empty words
Your ideology - self delusion
Revisionism is the future
So let's hail the same old dawn
Kneel before the same old order
You're no kings - only pawns

You're waiting for tomorrow, well tomorrow never comes
Ha, you're waiting for your new dawn, so sad to say there isn't one
Because, tomorrow belongs to nobody
Tomorrow - belongs to nobody

You're waiting for tomorrow, well tomorrow never comes
Ha, you're waiting for your new dawn, so sad to say there isn't one
You fools tomorrow belongs to nobody
Tomorrow - belongs to nobody
