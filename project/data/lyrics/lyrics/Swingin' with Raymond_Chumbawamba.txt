These red azaleas never grew so tall
This well of loneliness
Could rise and drown us all

There is no right or wrong
Things fall as they do
Pulled by the sun and the moon
Forever comes too soon
People come
People go
But still I'll never let go
Ideas come
Ideas go
Still I'll never let go

Still I'll never let go

I've fallen for the girl
Been mad about the boy
When you've kissed an angel
There's just no choice

There is no right or wrong
Things fall as they do
Pulled by the sun and the moon
Forever comes too soon
People come
People go
But still I'll never let go
Ideas come
Ideas go
Still I'll never let go

Still I'll never let go

Lying there with the squares on the kitchen floor
Watch the clock's pointing fingers
It's seen it all before

There is no right or wrong
Things fall as they do
Pulled by the sun and the moon
Forever comes too soon
People come
People go
But still I'll never let go
Ideas come
Ideas go
Still I'll never let go

Still I'll never let go

Still I'll never let go

Still I'll never let go

Still I'll never let go

(Still I'll never let go)
