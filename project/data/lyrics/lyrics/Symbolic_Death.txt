[Verse 1]
In the dark of night, abusing a portion of light
While others are sleeping and some are escaping
A serpent spews out fantasy, unjustified blasphemy
That cannot be condoned

[Pre-Chorus]
It must be strange to not have lived so far into existence

[Chorus]
This is not a test of power
This is not a game to be lost or won, let justice be done

[Bridge]
There will be zero tolerance for the creator of hallowed intentions
There will be zero tolerance, fate is your deciding God

[Verse 2]
Karma comes crashing down, leaving a very deep scar
Exposing a door to the source of a verbal whore
Machines supply the altar, where virtuous lives are sacrificed

[Pre-Chorus]
It must be strange to not have lived so far into existence

[Chorus]
This is not a test of power
This is not a game to be lost or won, let justice be done

 

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Ashes and promises
Share a bond through the winds of change
Words are blown away
When visions that should be
Are tattooed in your mind
The power to let go is sometimes hard to find

[Pre-Chorus 1]
The answer cannot be found
In the writing of others or the words of a trained mind
In a precious world of memories
We find ourselves confined

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Claws so razor sharp
Ripping at the spirit

[Chorus]
Promises a potential to hurt, is anything real?
When forever is to be until
Deep inside, in the world of empty words...
No escaping from those haunting empty words...

[Instrumental]

[Bridge]
Do you ever feel it? A craving that is so strong
To by thought rewind in order to find

[Verse 2]
Expectations that shined
Through the doubt that soon would turn into the price
Of what a word
Will be worth when tomorrow comes
To be and we are left
Standing on our own and seeing what is real

[Pre-Chorus 1]
The answer cannot be found
In the writing of others, or the words of a trained mind
In a precious world of memories
We find ourselves confined

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Claws so razor sharp
Ripping at the spirit

[Chorus]
Promises a potential to hurt, is anything real?
When forever is to be until
Deep inside, in the world of empty words...
No escaping from those haunting empty words...
