[Verse 1]
When you meet that certain someone you've been searching hard to find
It's a new love full of passion that can sometimes make you blind
I don't mind being swept away if I know right from the start
So before we go much further girl, can I trust you with my heart

[Verse 2]
In the time we've spent together, I have learned to trust in you
So many things you've given before I even asked you to
But reality and romance are sometimes far apart
So what I really need to know is, can I trust you with my heart

[Chorus]
Can I cast my cares upon you, can you stand the heavy load
Can I count on you to walk me down that long and winding road
If you promise me these simple things, I can guarantee
You can always count on me girl, oh

[Chorus]
Can I cast my cares upon you, can you stand the heavy load
Can I count on you to walk me down that long and winding road
When two hearts solely surrender, and are sworn to understand
It completes a perfect union between a woman and a man
So please don't misunderstand me, I don't want to go too far
Without knowing just one answer, can I trust you with my heart

[Tag]
Please girl
Give me just one answer
Can I trust you with my heart
