[Verse 1]
Just about now
I'd be watching you wake up
Feeling my heart beat with yours
Just about now
Is when we would make love
Like all of the mornings before
But I know it don't help
To turn the clock back
'Cause I'm not gonna make it
'Til I face this fact

[Chorus]
This is not about trying to go back in time
This is not about where I'll be a year down the line
It's just moment to moment
Surviving somehow
This is not about then
This is just about now

[Verse 2]
Just about now
You'd pull in the driveway
And I'd be there waving hello
Run to my arms
You'd kiss me and hold me
As if you'd never let go
And it's just about now when the tears start to fall
I wonder if I'm gonna make it at all

[Chorus]
This is not about trying to go back in time
This is not about where I'll be a year down the line
It's just moment to moment
Surviving somehow
This is not about then
This is just about now

[Outro]
It's just moment to moment
Surviving somehow
This is not about then
This is just about now
