[Verse 1]
Now here you go again, you say you want your freedom
Well who am I keep you down
It's only right that you should play the way you feel it
But listen carefully to the sound of your loneliness

[Pre-Chorus]
Like a heartbeat drives you mad
In the stillness of remembering what you had
And what you lost

[Chorus]
Yeah, thunder only happens when it's raining
Players only love you when they're playing
Yeah, women they will come and they will go
When the rain washes you clean, you'll know, you'll know

[Verse 2]
Now here I go again, I see the crystal visions
I keep my visions to myself
Well, it's only me that wants to wrap around your dreams
And have you any dreams you'd like to sell
Dreams of loneliness

[Pre-Chorus]
Like a heartbeat drives you mad
In the stillness of remembering what you had
And what you lost

[Chorus]
Thunder only happens when it's raining
Players only love you when they're playing
Yeah, women they will come and they will go
When the rain washes you clean, you'll know

Yeah, thunder only happens when it's raining
Players only love you when they're playing
Yeah, women they will come and they will go
When the rain washes you clean, you'll know, you'll know

[Outro]
You'll know, you'll know, you'll know, you'll know
