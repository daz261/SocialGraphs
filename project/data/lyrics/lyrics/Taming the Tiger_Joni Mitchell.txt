[Verse 1]
Since I lost you
I can't get through the day
Without at least one big boo-hoo
The pain won't go away
What am I gonna do?
Man from Mars
This time you went too far

[Verse 2]
I fall apart
Everytime I think of you
Swallowed by the dark
There is no center to my life now
No grace in my heart
Man from Mars
This time you went too far

[Verse 3]
I call and call
The silence is so full of sounds
You're in them all
I hear you in the water
And the wiring in the walls
Man from Mars
This time you went too far

 

[Verse 1]
He said "You think you're a lady
But I know you're a woman
We are as young as the night"
I said "No telephones ringing
No company coming
Just the lap of the lake and the firelight"
And the lonely loon and the crescent moon
What a pocket of heavenly grace

[Refrain]
But in France they say
Everyday
Love puts on a new face
Love has many faces

[Verse 2]
About a month or so later he said
"Why can't you be happy
You make me feel helpless when you get this way"
I said "I'm up to my neck in alligators
Jaws gnashing at me
Each one trying to pull a piece away"
Darling, you can't slay these beasts of prey
Some bad dreams even love can't erase

[Refrain]
But in France they say
Everyday
Love puts on a new face
Love has many faces

[Verse 3]
He said "I wish you were with me here
The leaves are electric
They burn on the river bank
Countless heatless flames"
I said "Send me some pictures then
And I'll paint pyrotechnic
Explosions of your autumn till we meet again
I miss your touch and your lips so much
I long for our next embrace"

[Refrain]
But in France they say
Everyday
Love puts on a new face
Love puts on a new face
Love has many faces
Many many faces
