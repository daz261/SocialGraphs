[Verse]
I know you won't believe these things I tell you
No, you won't believe
Your heart has been forewarned all men will lie to you
And your mind cannot conceive
Now all depends on what I say to you
And on your doubting me
So I've prepared these statements far from true
Pay heed and disbelieve

[Chorus]
The sun is filled with ice and gives no warmth at all
And the sky was never blue
The stars are raindrops searching for a place to fall
And I never cared for you

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
The sun is filled with ice and gives no warmth at all
And the sky was never blue
The stars are raindrops searching for a place to fall
And I never cared for you

[Outro]
And I never cared for you
I never cared for you

 

[Verse 1]
I'll take you with me everywhere I go
I'll put you in my pocket who will know?
Right next to my heart at every show
I'll take you with me everywhere I go

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
No matter where our trails will finally wind
Our paths will just keep crossing yours and mine
Until then and in my pocket you must go
I'll take you with me everywhere I go

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
No matter where our trails will finally wind
Our paths will just keep crossing yours and mine
Until then and in my pocket you must go
And I'll take you with me everywhere I go

[Outro]
Until then and in my pocket you must go
And I'll take you with me everywhere i go
