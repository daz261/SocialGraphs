Automatic love is all I want
End of the day
Automatic love is all I got
To get away

Rounds of lead deliver me today
I got no blood to waste on foreplay
You can make all the decisions
You can make all them incisions

Automatic love is all I want
End of the day
Automatic love is all I got
To get away

I come to town, got pistol on my mind
One more bullet proof sister all I find
Don't ask me for directions
I'll offer you no infections

Automatic love is all I want

If you're driving by town
Won't you gun me down
I got no time to waste
I'm her intention bound

Automatic love is all I want
Automatic love is all I got

Newborn, you're such a stranger
When you got no grind with danger

Automatic love is all I want
End of the day
Automatic love is all I got
Get away

Automatic love is all I want
End of the day
Automatic love is all I got
To get away

Automatic love is all I want
End of the day
Automatic love is all I got
To get away

Automatic, automatic love is all I got
