This is a picture of things going a little out of hand
This is a sculpture of a couple of things we've got to get straight
Sooner rather than later, she has invented a tool
To shout at a world what... What it means when...
When I'm in a bad mood...
There are angels there
You know where they keep angels?
Heaven, that's where
I can't wait to die
I can find me some
That's where I'll find my wife
When I'm through with my present one

 

As a boy he dreamed of a rocket
Unlike a rocket
Like a flat, round piece of stone
He flew
Like a rocket
Anyway he flew
Anyway he flew
As a man
Dreamed of a rocket
Sitting in a chair
Sitting in a chair
Is an old man
Anyway he flew
Like a rocket
Anyway he flew
