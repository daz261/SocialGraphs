Which girl is the right one
Is the perfect one for me
If I glanced in her direction
Will I know which one she'll be

She looks so good
That I wish I could
She looks so fine
That I want to make her mine

Which one is the sweetie
Is the sweetest one for me
I've been looking for forever
Do you ever think I'll see

She looks so nice
That I want to see her twice
She looks so good
That I wish I could

She looks so good
That I wish I could
She looks so fine
That I wish she were mine
She looks so nice
That I want to see her twice
But she seems so free
That I wish she was me
