Who's that face in the council estate
Looks like he's been staying up late
Drug me up and what do I see
A little bit of you and a little bit of me

Little bit of this and a little bit of that
Little bit of this and a little bit of that
Little bit of this and a little bit of that
Little bit of this and a little bit of that

Everybody's talking so sincere
Nobody's telling me what I want to hear
Drug me up and what do I see
A little bit of you and a little bit of me

Little bit of this and a little bit of that
Little bit of this and a little bit of that
Little bit of this and a little bit of that
Little bit of this and a little bit of that

What makes you so weird and freaky
What makes you so clean and squeaky
Jump the wire in and out
All I wanna know is how can I get out

Stop drugs sorted geezers
Packet of fags and laid out Rizlas
Drug me up and what do I see
A little bit of you and a little bit of me

Little bit of this and a little bit of that
Little bit of this and a little bit of that
Little bit of this and a little bit of that
Little bit of this and a little bit of that

What makes you so weird and freaky
What makes you so clean and squeaky
Jump the wire in and out
All I wanna know is how can I get out
Get out

Who's that face in the council estate
Looks like he's been staying up late
Drug me up and what do I see
A little bit of you and a little bit of me

Little bit of this and a little bit of that
Little bit of this and a little bit of that
Little bit of this and a little bit of that
Little bit of this and a little bit of that

Everybody's talking so sincere
Nobody's telling me what I want to hear
Drug me up and what do I see
A little bit of you and a little bit of me

Little bit of this and a little bit of that
Little bit of this and a little bit of that
Little bit of this and a little bit of that
Little bit of this and a little bit of that

Little bit of this and a little bit of that
Little bit of this and a little bit of that
