Take your own
Sick with fever
And cry out loud
To God
Your sorry own
Will be piled upon me
That I can't see
My God

I've cried for earth
More than once
But rivers still run
With reddest tears
Be lost in me
And I'll never need to ask
Who wants me? Who wants Me?

Be mine tonight. The sight of your light
I'll breathe in you. I'm a fool, just for you

I'm in pain
And I don't know why
Under heavy rain
From darkest skies
We're in pain
The two of us
And I no longer know
Which way to go

Open wide. Let me see
Your bleeding heart cries for me
Look straight up. Look at the sun
This song's for her. Her requiem
Open wide. Let me see
A poisoned soul in agony
Self pity strangles me
I'm lashed by grief
And I'm killing me

Don't fear. My fire is enough
For both of us

Be mine tonight. The sight of your light
I'll breathe in you. I'm a fool, just for you

 

Lie beside me on the grass
They're fighting for me thee
Mistress of beauty, thine eyes do shine
Can we run forever? Does nightfall shine?
Angel of mercy, carry me away
Those black dogs tear at me
They hunger for the life of me
So lie beside me, neath the earth

Lost forever from the earth
Descending downwards. Is this our re-birth?
Can you feel it? His cruelty glows
This teribble journey, oh, that no-one knows

Down
Around here, I am
Ruler of Kings
Here
Everywhere I Am Heard
The Voice of me
Enters you
Now you're mine
