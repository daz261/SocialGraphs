[Verse 1]
I talk through my eyes, the words pourin' down
Nobody hears
You ask me what's wrong, but what can I say
Nobody hears

[Refrain 1]
I try to tell you, I try to show you
How else can I tell you, how else can I show you

[Verse 2]
I'm screaming inside, why can't you hear
Nobody hears
You're looking right though me like I'm not here
Nobody hears

[Pre-Chorus]
When the last tear falls down
Nothing gets washed away
Another plea put to rest
As nobody hears, nobody hears

[Chorus 1]
So what did I do to you
That makes you run from me
Now I'm sitting here screaming inside myself
Don't understand why nobody hears

[Verse 3]
You figured it out, shaped it to your perfection
Nobody hears
Subtracted my feelings from this equation
Nobody hears

[Refrain 2]
Is it all in my mind (all in my mind)
Then it would be easy to find

[Pre-Chorus]
When the last tear falls down
Nothing gets washed away
Another plea put to rest
As nobody hears, nobody hears

[Chorus 1]
So what did I do to you
That makes you run from me
Now I'm sitting here screaming inside myself
Don't understand why nobody hears

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
So if it's all, if it's all in my mind
Then wouldn't it, wouldn't it
Wouldn't it be so easy to find

[Pre-Chorus]
When the last tear falls down
Nothing gets washed away
Another plea put to rest
As nobody hears, nobody hears

[Chorus 2]
So what do I have to do
To make you comfort me
Now I'm sitting here screaming inside myself
Don't understand why nobody hears

[Outro]
So I'm sitting here screaming inside myself
Well I'm sitting here crying inside myself
So I'm sitting here screaming to nobody else
Don't understand why nobody hears
And nobody hears
Nobody hears
Nobody hears
(Nobody hears)
