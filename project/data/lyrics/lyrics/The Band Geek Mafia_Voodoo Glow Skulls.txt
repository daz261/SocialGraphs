My girl she supports me and that's not supposed to be
When she starts to fight with me she knows that I can't win
Sometimes she believes in me and gives me a big kiss
Then, sometimes she doesn't I start to get real pissed

I wrote her this love letter
But she don't know how to read
I wrote her this love letter
But she don't know how to read

It happens once a month we get into a fight
Arguing in circles and not knowing who's wrong or right
Tempers start flaring and articles start to fly
She has all her friends convinced that I'm a crazy guy

When it's time to walk alone-
The feeling hits me in the place
That place that only she can touch
Not just any pretty face

She's a queen and doesn't even know this
Ruling that kingdom in my heart
When I'm gone and running with the devil
She'll be at home waiting patiently
