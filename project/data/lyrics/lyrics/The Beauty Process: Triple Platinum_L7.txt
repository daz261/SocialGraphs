[Verse 1]
Wah Wah one and one is two
We got a drama
I'm watching TV and I don't need you
Bring on the drama
I'll tell you something and you know it's true
You're full of drama
My piss is yellow and the sky is blue
We got a drama

[Pre-Chorus]
Spare me
(Bab-bab-bab-bab)
You're draining me
(Bab-bab-bab-bab)
Ah ah ah, ah ah ah

[Verse 2]
Wah Wah one and two is three
Bring on the drama
There's something wrong yeah I agree
We got a drama
I'll tell you something, you're choking me
With all your drama
Life stinks and the grass is green
We got a drama

[Pre-chours]
Spare me
(Bab-bab-bab-bab)
You're draining me
Spare me
(Bab-bab-bab-bab)
You're draining me, draining me

[Chorus]
Ah ah ah, ah ah ah
Ah ah ah, ah ah ah
You're draining me
Ah ah ah, ah ah ah
You're draining me
Ah ah ah, ah ah ah

[Pre-chours]
Spare me
(Bab-bab-bab-bab)
You're draining me
Spare me
(Bab-bab-bab-bab)
You're draining me, draining me, draining me, draining me

[Chorus]
Ah ah ah, ah ah ah
Ah ah ah, ah ah ah
You're draining me
Ah ah ah, ah ah ah
You're draining me
Ah ah ah, ah ah ah
You're draining me
Ah ah ah, ah ah ah
You're draining me
Ah ah ah, ah ah ah
