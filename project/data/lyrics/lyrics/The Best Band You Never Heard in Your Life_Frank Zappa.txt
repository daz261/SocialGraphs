Find her finer, sneak up behind her
Unwrap like a mummy 'til you finally unwind her
Find her, blind her, see who designed her
Act like a dummy 'til you finally grind her

If you should see a girl on the street
Now maybe you might think she is sweet
But if you wanna tickle her treat
Now really what should you do?

Don't never let her know you are smart
The universe is nowhere to start
You gotta play it straight from the heart
She gwine renunciate you

That's why you gotta

Find her finer, sneak up behind her
Unwrap like a mummy 'til you finally unwind her
Find her, blind her, see who designed her
Act like a dummy 'til you finally grind her

Now maybe you might think this is crude
And maybe you might think I am rude
And maybe this approach I have spewed
Is not the one for you

But believe me later on you'll find
As you impress her with your mind
That you will just be left behind
For a wiser fool

So you might as well

Find her finer, sneak up behind her
Unwrap like a mummy 'til you finally unwind her
Find her, blind her, see who designed her
Act like a dummy 'til you finally grind her
