Come on along with the Black Rider
We'll have a gay old time
Lay down in the web of the black spider
I'll drink your blood like wine

So come on in
It ain't no sin
Take off your skin
And dance around in your bones
So come on along with the Black Rider
We'll have a gay old time

Step right up and hold right on there, little
Have your tickets ready, under twelve are free
Anchors away with the Black Rider
I'll drink your blood like wine
I'll drop you off in Harlem with the Black Rider
Out where the bullets shine

And when you're done, you'll cock your gun
The blood will run like ribbons through your hair
Just come on along with the Black Rider
We'll have a gay old time

Lines form to the left
Have your tickets ready
See the dog-faced boy

Come on along with the Black Rider
I've got just the thing for thee
Come on along with the Black Rider
I want your company

I'll have the veal, a lovely meal
That's how I feel, may I use your skull for a bowl?
Just come on along with the Black Rider
We'll have a gay old
We'll have a gay old
We'll have a gay old
We'll have a gay old
We'll have a gay old time

 

No shadows, no stars
There's no moon and no cars
November

It only believes in a pile of dead leaves
And a moon that's the color of bone
No prayers for November to linger longer

Stick your spoon in the wall and we'll slaughter them all
November has tied me to an old dead tree
Get word to April to rescue me

November's cold chain made of wet boots and rain
And shiny black ravens on chimney smoke lanes
November seems odd, you're my firing squad
November

With my hair slicked back with carrion shellac
And the blood from a pheasant and the bone from a hare
Tied to the branches of a roebuck stag
Left to wave in the timber like a buckshot flag

Go away, you rainsnout
Go away, blow your brains out
November
