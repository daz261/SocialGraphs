[Intro]
Mmm, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
I've been talkin' to
Some friends of mine about you, boy
They say you're 'bout to have a child
When you gonna tell me 'bout it?
This other chick you're sleepin' with
Now you gotta deal with it
Hope you've found happiness
I've found myself in such a mess

[Pre-Chorus 1]
With you
And I put way too much love
Into you
Thought that one day
We'll be true
And time after time
I stuck with you
But now I'm too through

[Chorus 1]
'Cause I've been the fool
Sittin' 'round too long
I think it's about time that I
Ring the bell and carry on
Forgave you before (Yes, I did, yes, I did, yes, I did)
But it's too far gone
I think it's about time that I
Ring the bell and move along

[Verse 2]
You said it was a mistake
On the night you saw her late
Must've been for pure affection
Boy, you didn't have protection
You had to think of me
But you did never see
Yourself in this predicament
You never thought that it would catch up with you

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Put way too much love
Into you
Thought that one day
We'll be true
And time after time
I stuck with you
But now I'm too through

[Chorus 2]
'Cause I've been the fool (Yeah, yeah)
Sittin' 'round too long (Sittin' 'round too long)
I think it's about time that I
Ring the bell and carry on (Oh, oh)
Forgave you before (Before)
But it's too far gone
I think it's about time that I (About time that I)
Ring the bell and move along

[Chorus 3]
'Cause I've been the fool (Baby)
Sittin' 'round too long (Baby, baby, baby)
I think it's about time that I (Ooh, ooh)
Ring the bell and move along
Forgave you before (I forgave you before, baby)
But it's too far gone
I think it's about time that I
Ring the bell and move along (Yeah, yeah)

[Bridge]
How awful the way
You treated me
Gave you everything (I gave you everything, oh)
So hurt to say (I'm so hurt)
You didn't tell me
Can't wait to leave
Baby, yeah

[Chorus 3]
'Cause I've been the fool (I don't really want to know, baby)
Sittin' 'round too long (You did never really care for me)
I think it's about time (I don't really want to know, baby)
That I ring the bell and carry on (You did never really care for me)
I forgave you before (Ooh)
But it's too far gone (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I think it's about time
That I ring the bell and move along

[Outro]
'Cause I've been the fool (There goes my man)
Sittin' round too long (You're a fool, sittin' all around)
