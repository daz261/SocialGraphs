It makes you weak
It makes you strong
Been in your blood too long
I took your nights
You took my star
One I wished on last year
Ah ah ah ah
Tell it to the sky
Tell it to the sky
Tell it to the sky
For no one
So you fucked all
All that we had
I took the ball and ran
It makes you weak
It makes you strong
Been in your blood too long
Ah ah ah ah
Tell it to the sky
Tell it to the sky
Tell it to the sky
For no one
Tell it to the sky
Tell it to the sky
Tell it to the sky
For no one
I see you coming back to me
I hear you're coming back to me
Ah ah ah ah
Tell it to the sky
Tell it to the sky
Tell it to the sky
For no one
Tell it to the sky
Tell it to the sky
Tell it to the sky
For no one
