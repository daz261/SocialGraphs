Caught in the vice of heaven and earth
He turned his life into a cell
Imprisoned by the doubts which hound us all
And those desires which we all know so well
His days he lost to promises, his nights he purged of dreams
And he would wake in the hours before sunrise
And dread the coming of the day

Never thought a man could become so desperate
Never thought a life could lose so much hope
To be tearing at the roots around you
As if in manacles, or irons, or ropes
They say he told his children that all he taught was lost
That love and pride and honesty
Were to be gained at too high a cost

It's been thirty summers that I've spent with him
And I expect thirty more to pass
He has blessed my life in so many ways
That I could never turn my back
But I need just one more reminder
Of the man that he used to be
If he would just look deep into my eyes
And say it's in you my love that I will find the key

 

She captured both rock and bird
Tied one to the leg of the other
Kept them as prisoners
Until they knew who was master

Then she threw them to the sky
Bird with unbarred wings disappeared
Rock with weighted heart returned

And rock became her anchor
And bird became her dream

Now she stands on the forest floor
Among the pines and towering firs
Rock still firm beneath her feet
Bird perched high above her

Singing songs of love's betrayal
'I offered you my endless skies
You countered with hoods and chains
This song I sing will be the last
To be inspired by your memory'

 

There are witches in the hills calling my name
Saying come join us sister, come kiss the flame
Come dance in the moonbeams, ride the night wind
Make love to the darkness and laugh at man's sins

I shiver with delight, I shiver with fear
My heart wants to go but my soul's filled with fear
So I turn to my lover and ask what do I do
Do I answer their call or stay here with you

But under spell of deep sleep he moans and turns away
Taking his protection and my desire to stay
So I rise to the hill tops, I ride the night winds
I make love to the darkness and laugh at man's sins

 

(Michael Timmins)

The way you kissed me this morning
It told me that you soon would be going
You didn't even look in my eyes
When you said goodbye

And last night in your sleep you broke all the promises
That I knew you would never keep
Now I'm reading the letter which you placed on the dresser
And you're five hundred miles down the road

Escape is so simple
In a world where sunsets can be raced
But distance only looses the knife
The pattern of its scar
Can always be traced

Yeah, I remember when we said 'forever'
Was the craziest word that we knew
But I think that I like it much better than I do 'goodbye'

And I could sit here all evening and think of the reasons
Why you are not by my side
Instead I'll go to the kitchen, find a strong chair to sit in
And drink myself far, far away

Escape is so simple
In a world where sunsets can be raced
But distance only looses the knife
The pattern of its scar
Can always be traced
