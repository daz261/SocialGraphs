Now Yin and Yang, they got together at the bank
They had a young 'un and they grew him in a tank
They got to get to work and they put him on a train
And you know they got together and they're doing it again, oh baby

Punk Rock City
Going up to Punk Rock City
Going up to Punk Rock City

And when this shit got started it was never gonna stop
Designer genes for all the punks to live on top
Got to get to work, got to get them on the train
If youre never gonna die then youre never gonna come back here again

Punk Rock City
Going up to Punk Rock City
Going up to Punk Rock City
Punk Rock City

We're brother sister and we are doing fine
Spend our whole life working in the mine
We get the train and we get ourselves to work
Then we have a little party then we have a little party, baby

Punk Rock City, wooh
Going up to Punk Rock City
I'm going up to Punk Rock City
Going up to Punk Rock City

Never die in Punk Rock City
Punk Rock City
