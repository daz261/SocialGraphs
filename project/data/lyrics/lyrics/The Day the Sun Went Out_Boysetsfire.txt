My eyes have burned
With a fire that I could not prevent
It burned their nation's children
And crushed their patriot
Dead the hate we sent them so many years ago
Returned to haunt them
Leads us against the foe
With out fire
Their land
Our fire
Their wounds
My hands are cold with your blood
Torn to shreds with our kill toys
Sit back and watch the fun
Rated, screened, censored, sedated
Spoon-fed their noxious lies
So many times we've watched silently

 

I could lie here for a day
Tongue tied and out classed
Never missing their world that used to be my life
And I can't remember what it was
That I always wanted
But it should have always been this rhyme and reason
Not withstanding
Folded into beauty
And if I hold this here forever
I will never drown
And when I lose my ground
I can always remember
This is my reason
You are my reason to stay
I have shed this dry hard shell
Traded its comfort for your eyes
Played with denial
And then denied my own defenses
It's no longer a part of me
These questions, and insecurities
You will always be the most magnificent creation
