[Verse 1]
Rat tat tat tat 'til your ass hit the motherfucking floor
Now what is you fucking with a nigga for
Apparently, you haven't heard of me
It's going to take more motherfuckers than in the compound to murder me
I fucks up vision like a sand shower
You going up against a stacked deck nigga, now where your man power
Bring your motherfucking backup
And blow the bugle when I step off this bitch and load this gat up
Cause still a nigga finna bust you
Deaden your head from the front and knock the back up off that motherfucker
Now listen to the gunshot
I got that ass with that double barrel, one shot
Now I don't hear your heart beating
Now I don't see your boy breathing, rat tat tat tat

[Verse 2]
I see your mama in the waiting room, steady crying
I see your ass in the doctor's arms, slowly dying
Now talk that shit that you was talking to your homie
Bitch you should have shot me when you pulled your fucking pistol on me
So now I'm forced to pop the clip in
S to the motherfucking A, nigga set tripping
It ain't no love when my finger's on the trigger
It ain't no love for you off balance ass niggas
So keep your ass in the neutral spot
Cause if you rolling through my hood while we feuding then you getting got

You out of pocket when you fucking with me, so now it's on boy
I ain't runnin to get my shit like these other busters
When you see me round this bitch I got that motherfucker
So I ain't fucking with the club life
I'm like Pac, I'm making mail but I still live the thug life
My rap name's getting bigger
But ain't nothing changed, I still got the game to handle all you bitch niggas
So a nigga's always strapped
Nuts been big since a kid you motherfucker so it ain't rap
Toe to toe, back to back, gat for gat
It's like that motherfucker, rat tat tat tat

[Verse]
Now the funeral is over, and all the tears are dried up
Niggas hanging tape on the cut getting fired up
Looking for the nigga who pulled his pistol on my homie
An eye for an eye, so now your life is what you owe me
Look deep into the eyes of your motherfucking killer
I want you to witness your motherfucking murder, nigga
And since you wants to kill then your ass has gots to fry
But ain't no police, therefore your ass has gots to die
We play the game for keeps and if you slipped I guess you sleep
You sho' nuff fucked and now your ass is six feet deep
Cause where I come from yo, everybody's got a gat
And niggas try your ass just to see where you got your heart at
And if your shit is flimsy then your ass is gonna bend
And like I said before there'll be no tears in the end
I'm rolling through your hood and now my heart is filled with anger
You at your sister's house now your sister's life's in danger (by a total stranger)
With a gang of, niggas wanting to bang you
And hang you, stain you, with one up in the chamber
Let's take a trip up Holaway
So you can see how many niggas in my hood is down to die today
We standing up for our own shit
And if you outside the clique then you die, bitch
It ain't no love in this motherfucker
It ain't no love for yourself or your other brother, uh
Because we real with this shit so we stay true
And since we bang then we do what O.G. say do
I've got the mind of the man in the mirror so I'm looking at me vaguely
But I can't seem to fade me
I've got my pistol pawn cocked
Ready to lay shots nonstop until I see your monkey-ass drop
And let your homies know who done it
Cause when it comes to this gangsta shit you motherfuckers know who run it
So when you put this motherfucker to the test
You gotta realize something nigga
You fucking with the very best
I got this killa up inside of me
I can't talk to my mother so I talk to my diary
I'm going off on the deep end
I found myself face-to-face with myself while I'm sleeping
I see your picture in my head and my hands shake
You can run, you can hide but there's no escape
My inner feelings show no mercy on my enemy
I got to get this mutherfucker fore he gets to me
So in your own blood, you'll bathe
And I won't stop until I put this motherfucker in his fucking grave
And I can say this once again
You can cry but you'll still die
They'll be no tears in the end
