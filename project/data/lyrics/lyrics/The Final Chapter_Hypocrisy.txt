[Verse 1]
Learning through pain
To feed your mind against yourself
To become an exterminate machine
Deciding on the future of the earth
Read my mind as I read yours
You just feel what I feel
I control your life and thought
Don't you try to wipe me out

[Chorus]
I am creator
Universal domination
The source of eternity
I am the black hole

[Bridge]
I'll flick with my finger
I'll push you off the edge

[Verse 2]
I choose to destroy your mind
Like the fires can't be stopped
A profound, appalling hatred that
Many years have watched us kill

[Chorus]
I am creator
Universal domination
The source of eternity
I am the black hole

[Bridge]
With a flick of my fingers
Iâ€™ll push you off the edge
With a flick of my fingers
You'll disappear

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
I am creator
Universal domination
The source of eternity
I am the black hole
I am creator
Universal domination
The source of eternity
I am the black hole
