[Hook] (2x)

C-H-I-C-A-G-O
It's the final tic and here we go
Forget about them other styles
Conflict kicking rodeo

[Verse 1: Kilo]

Once upon a time
In the land of gang bang mentality
When we drop quick
Final tic clique
Fatality is reality
When the sunset
We blaze this hay
In the midst of a Conflict that's Crucial
Here we become bogus on the hunt
Notice how we speak this bump
If you wondering what is rodeo
THEN SADDLE UP!
For a different adventure
A journey to Chicago
Westside where the hood lie
95 bound, we talking bout shit
Of a different plane
Sing along, here we bang
The rooting tooting shooting Maniacs
Banging gats, blunted high
The gat going up tonight giddy up
We copping that game at the drop of a dime
Cause really where I'm at
Scandalous, peeping the foes
You gotta know the signs
Load 'em up fast time running out
Turn 'em in turn 'em round
For the Conflict
If youz a snitch you betta get a grip
And come equipped for the Final Tic

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Cold Hard]

You know again it's on in the motherfucker
Still riding, my style is based on rodeo
Crucial Conflict what they hollering
They spooky now nigga let's turn it on
Fuck it burn shit
Let's fight till we hear that final tic
Kill till we kill each other clik
Bitch, you was talking crazy
But now we're finna shut your damn mouth
Send your bitch ass back down south
Let you know that your ass out
Niggas playing these games like a lame
Get they ass whipped
Beat up and slapped around
Broken legs, pistol whipped
Two eyes out, two busted lips
Teeth knocked out, two busted whips
Bloody body up for gives
That's the life you chose to live
Now what's up wid that tough shit
I knew your ass was just a bitch
Drop you down just like a bomb
And you got the Final Tic

[Hook] (2x)

[Verse 3: Never]

Nigga this the final tic
Punk bitches done made me mad
Bust a cap and jump back and it's on
And I'm gone, ain't got a damn thing to say
Push push and push one more motherfuckin' time
Fuck a bitch fighting ain't the same no more
So I got the stinking ho
Push that bitch 6 under zero
Who the role model for Chicago
Kicking down the door wid the rodeo
C-O-N-flict, trigger happy got the bomb
Up in the barnyard
Smoking on hay everyday in the Chi-Town
Had you throw down wid rodeo fever
And we got our mind made up
Give a fuck what the next man say gotta make it
Let me get down and take it
To that other level, petty ride
Who doing the killing
Presuming to killing the villain
I'mma meet you on that other side
Born to kill a man gotta kill a man
Born to ride and ride and roll in thick
I'mma come on up so you betta get ready
For the last and Final Tic

[Hook]

[Verse 4: WildStyle]

This is my final tic
I didn't mean to show my ass off
But I can't be soft, coming off nasty
Wouldn't want to kill a nigga if you wanna
Make it out alive, cause you might die
I could fuck up your homies
Every last one a y'all is a free fall aw no
Dynamite all around me
In ten more seconds we all might be gone
Four tons of death
You can't escape the Conflict
Wid the rodeo when you explode
It's overloading the flow
If you know what I know
Better pray cause it won't be no more
Did you wanna be blindfolded
Pressure, all around make you feel it
I'mma villain I'mma kill it
Final tic tock quick
In the room and smoke it
Close you eyes and hold on tight
Don't try to fight it's on tonight
Bet a motherfucker now won't touch that mic
Cause he might get this dynamite
Grabbed your face trying to get away
Conflict done dropped the bomb bitch
Straight from C-H-I, we never die
You know I talk that final tic

[Hook] (6x)

 

*Threats, fighting, and drum loops in background*

[Chorus]
Niggas laying down on the ground
It's a showdown
Don't you come around trying to clown
It's a showdown
Niggas laying down on the ground
It's a showdown
Don't you come around trying to clown
It's a showdown

[Verse 1]
Listen up all you damned dare varmints
It's finna be a showdown
Better flee the scene
That's on the real
Better keep that head down
Pick a bigger strap, better come equip
And don't trip cause I'm bout to let it loose
Pullin' out a pocket knife
Will get you snyped
And you know niggas is gonna have to shoot
Could it be that I had the loot
In a mood for bustin' chickens
Nigga thought he had him a sweet vic
But he had him a schizophrenic
Better have that itchy for the homicide
Ain't no love, I'ma let it ride
Now it's gonna be a showdown
On the lowdown
Better stay inside
Trippin' cause a nigga gonna die
If Billy Joe didn't tell that lie
He would still be in the barn
Instead, he got buckshots in his right side
Ms. Hay she cooked as punkin pie
Gettin' high in the fuckin' barn
The showdown it was all good
And I came home with that smokey gun

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Wait a minute
Hold up now
Who want confrontation
Punk ass nigga, you run with a clique
Ha, I ride with a nation
And I'm bustin'
Not to mention I'm cappin' every nigga
On your deck, so don't sleep
To make you stifle
Got a rifle with a scope
You can't cope when the Conflict's on the creep
You came to close to the Style, partner
Can't fuck with the rodeo
Here we go, wild westside
Gitty up, move em out
Head for the hills
I'ma let it ride
The trick didn't know about the gangbang boogie
'til it fell on the floor wit a ass full of lead
No need for calling out your momma name now
Son-of-a-bitch you dead!
On your mark
Get ready
Get set trip
I'm comin' wit a nine millimeter motherfucker
Like damn
My shit never jam
Like a hoe you fold
When I stuck you snipin
Off a building
Gangbangin' is an everyday thing
Runnin' down on a hoe down
Gotta low down
It's a showdown
Nigga bout to go down
Slow down!

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Wildstyle]
I'm just a bogus nigga
Fuck that nigga next to me
You get that ass dropped quick
Never had no love
Now you wanna challenge me
Fuck yo chief
We got some beef
When I die, it's gonna be a gang fight
I'ma be the nigga that take your life
Pop your ass, say nighty-night
Born to do some damage
I'll be damned if I let a motherfucker
Even think he rough
Blaze that bitch
And bust him up
Pussy motherfucker I'mma take your stuff
Shit is out of pocket man
But all this shit is finna change
Cause when I come this time
I'mma show that a nine ain't no joke
I'ma kill you some more
And show them fools Wildstyle ain't no hoe
And if I die we all gotta go
Bad thing about it, I don't give a fuck
Wondering what I'm livin' for
Face to face with a nigga that I hate
I'ma meet you on the hellground
Look you up in your eyes and spray
Smoke you in the showdown

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
A motherfucker told me it was gonna be a showdown
When I came around I was up for breakin' motherfuckers down
Fuck it niggas wit it
Let's rock the town
Flee on the scene
Now what's up baby
Car full of niggas straight lookin' shady
Came to loot
Better have what you gone shoot
Cause we straight actin' crazy
C-O-N Flict nigga
That's what it is when you tote them triggers
Gangbangalistic father figure
Daddy to the niggas that think they slicker
Yeah
It's a showdown
Not just my hood, but town to town
Making motherfuckers recognize the flavor
Coming from Chi-Town
Yee-Haw!
Be quick to draw
Pick a nigga meat up out the chainsaw
Make a nigga see what he never saw
Crucial Conflict comin' at you raw
For a showdown
We don't play around
Motherfuckers gone die
We gone kill 'em up pal
Motherfuckers playing these damn games
Kill 'em up in the showdown

[Chorus]
