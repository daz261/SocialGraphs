[Verse 1]
I think I've found the real love
Genuine and true
I think it's really come my way today babe
I think it's really you

[Verse 2]
I remember moments
Looking in your eyes
Could have sworn I saw the spark of love babe
Flickering inside

[Chorus]
I've been around and round this track
And the only thing I lack
Is the real love

[Verse 3]
Every time I see you
Every time we touch
I can feel the way you feel for me babe
And it means so much

[Chorus]
And every time you look at me
It's just the way it all should be
In the real love

[Bridge]
Oh darlin' darlin' darlin'
Stay with me stay
I long to see you in the morning sun
Everyday
Everyday

[Verse 4]
So until that moment
When I take your hand
I'm gonna try to do my very best babe
To prove that I'm your man

[Chorus]
I'm gonna do my very best
I'm not gonna rest
Until we've got the real love
Real love

[Outro]
Until we've got the real love
Until we've got the real love (Unh)
Until we've got the real love (Unh huh)
Until we've got the real love
Until we've got the real love
Until we've got the real love
Until we've got the real love
Until we've got the real love
Until we've got the real love
Until we've got the real love

 

It was a curious sight to me
A castle older than a redwood tree
Once lived in by royalty
Who taxed and raped the land

Mostly now it was stone and dust
Long damp halls and smells of must
Faded walls and ancient rust
Built on shifting sand
And I wanted I wanted I wanted
To smash that sucker down

It was a marvelous sight to see
A redhead workin' in a brasserie
Five foot nine built to a tee
Eyes so blue and bright
All the drunks were just circling round
I drank water and held my ground
Later on we did the town
And we caught every sight

Cause I wanted I wanted I wanted
To follow her down
Sightseein' freein' my soul
Sightseein' leavin' me on the road

It was a magical sight to me
And Yves Tanguy in a gallery
The 30's looking back at me
As if he really knew
I marveled at the artistry
Predating or technology
The vision there for all to see
Bold and strong and true

And I wanted I wanted I wanted
To take that painting home
I wanted I wanted
I wanted to take that vision home
