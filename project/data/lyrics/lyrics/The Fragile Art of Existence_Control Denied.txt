I saw you, you saw me, you hid your fangs so well
I should have known better but it is hard to tell
In beauty the evil is waiting for possession
Deep inside reflections just a glimpse away

Your faithful servants, they bow to you
Together they're breaking the broken

We were set free, what is to be?
When it's all said and done what is left to really say?
To be one turns to none now we are just yesterday

You speak in killing words, the kind that crush and kill
No mercy your pleasure to taste the blood you bled
The chase has ended in denial of glory
To trap and add to your servant souls

Your faithful servants, they bow to you
Together they're breaking the broken

We were set free, what is to be?
When it's all said and done what is left to really say?

 

And when life seems to be complete
It comes and knocks us off our feet
The element of surprise
The avengeful attack
Straight on your back it will send you
Into a state of deja-vu
Here it comes one more time
Showing its ugly face

Assaulting the senses
Screaming into the mind
Premeditating master plans
No need to underestimate

Prepare for what you cannot see
Expect the unexpected
And you will save yourself a state of shock
A waiting game, waiting to see
Expect the unexpected
And you will save yourself a state of shock

Another lesson learned to go with the others
That sit and wait to see
A silent voice

It doesn't matter who you are
In this sense we're all the same
To taste tranquility would be ecstasy
I'm holding on with all my might
To this ride we call life
Strapped down to clarity
Suprised no more

Assaulting the senses
Screaming into the mind
Premeditating master plans
No need to underestimate

Prepare for what you cannot see
Expect the unexpected
And you will save yourself a state of shock
A waiting game, waiting to see
Expect the unexpected
And you will save yourself a state of shock
