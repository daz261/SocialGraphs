[Verse 1]
On the way down, they saw a lot they don't remember
And if you asked them how, they couldn't say how they got there
And if you want them now, you could just pull on the lever
And say, "I'm hung up on gravity"
You move your mouth and you start to talk
You close your eyes and then lose the thought
What's mine is mine and what's yours you probably got
And we all fall

[Verse 2]
On the way down, they saw a lot they don't remember
And if you asked them how, they'd say that gravity's how they got there
And if you want them now, you could just pull on the lever
And say, "I'm hung up on this decade"
They bounced themselves off schools and halls
They created pagers to collect all their calls
What's mine is mine and what's yours and we all always fall
And we fall

 

[Instrumental]
