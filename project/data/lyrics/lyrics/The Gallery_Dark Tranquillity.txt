Time conceals itself in error
When all is turned to lie
Oh blissful rapture, flee from me
The liquid light shares its grandeur
The spring of Eden shall never run dry
Creation holds its breath

Tomorrow is no friend of mind
Drench logic, drench judgement
Awake, every sense is new

For we know no tomorrow
And yesterday appears in fragmented form

What now must burn
Shall with newfound strength emerge
Drift my eyes
Bacchi gates, bid me welcome

Drench logic
Drench judgement

So drink from the fountain everlasting...drown

With these eyes, the land can no longer deceive us

He cried into nothing with the voice of his soul
New logic brought upon the remains of his land
The land deceives
Bacchi gates, bid me welcome

Drench logic, drench judgement
Awake, every sense is new

For we know no tomorrow
And yesterday appears in fragmented form
