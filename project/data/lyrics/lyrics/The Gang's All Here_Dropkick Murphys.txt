Urban legend and American folklore
Tells of a man who was one of a kind
A sure gent with a flair for fashion
Prone to violence at any time

A legendary hooligan
With a thirst for blood and a taste for booze
This brave and daring brutal soul
He lived and fought by his own rules

Shake the hand that shook the world

Shoe-shine boy to champion
He'd fought and beaten many foes
His calling card was a kick to the groin
And a broken bottle to the bridge of the nose

He aimed to kill when he took to the ring
This Boston strong boy loved to fight
On more than one occasion
A bout was stopped to save an opponent's life

Shake the hand that shook the world
For blood and whiskey with a bare knuckled fist
