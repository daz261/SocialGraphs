[Verse 1: Bret "Epic" Mazur, Shifty Shellshock, both]
You know that bitch baby (He's talking shit about our clique)
But he don't know crazy (you see the writing on my dick)
You know that trick, Tracey (Yeah, she's making me sick)
Living that life, we used to do the same shit
Shit gets drastic, some kids need help, some need their ass kicked
And some will never learn to earn their own way
Living off their daddy had he not been rich
They'd be broker than a joke and forced to switch
You've got to change your tune or change your pitch
Because life ain't easy man, life's a bitch
Shit is harder than hard about as hard can get
Keep on going where you're headed, you's alive to regret it
Yes, it hurts to face the truth
And realize that the world's got your neck in a noose
If things ain't like they ought to be, you've got to think fast
The aftermath of your actions whiplash

[Chorus: Epic and Shifty]
Think fast!

[Verse 2: Dirty Unit]
I know you all tired of these wannabe thugs claiming they real
Be running, grabbing their steel, thinking they're going to peel
Somebody's caps, roaming the streets with black hats
Chrome straps, sipping on brew, ready to react
Off any nigga they see, that nigga could be me
Capital I-C-E, got a motherfuckin' .3-
57 to put eleven holes in their chest
Thinking they could test a real rider from the west
I roll flossin', me and my girlfriend Nina Ross and
The ghetto's been good to me but you've got to take precautions
Brothers get when they least expect it or neglect it
You'll never catch the dirty in the streets without protection
Nowadays you got to pull shit, haters on some bullshit
Jumpin' out of cadillacs and low-lows with a full clip
If your tool spits, shake the spot or get your duck on
'Cause if you press your luck on, stupid is what you're stuck on

[Chorus: Epic and Shifty]
Think fast!

[Verse 3: Bret "Epic" Mazur]
That girl Sheila got a daughter, she be clubbing every night
Sheila had her daughter young, still that just ain't right
Plus she rides the white horse, she used to ride my pony
If I hit it now, I'd break it, 'cause Sheila's just too bony!

[Verse 4: Bret "Epic" Mazur, Shifty Shellshock, Dirty Unit]
Smoking speed released the lions, I'm not lying, I'm not sober
I'm still trying, hiding the truth, with substitutes, a hundred proof
A fuck-up, face it, one of L.A.'s wasted youth
Label me as an enemy of the law, the lost star
[?]
My family's not too happy with the trouble that I've caused
See, we be breaking the law, smoking on non-menthols
Thinking fast, so I'm ready for any all-out brawls
And yo, brothers get your hustle on, ballers get your shit tight
House parties get shot up and turned up before midnight
Drive-bys and fistfights, zig-zags and crack pipes
There's a 50/50 chance that tonight will be your last night

[Chorus: Epic and Shifty]
Think fast!
