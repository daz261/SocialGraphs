[Verse 1]
Hey let's party
Let's get down
Let's turn the radio on
This is the meltdown
Get out the camera
Take a picture
The drag queens and the freaks
Are all out on the town
And cowboy Jane's in bed
Nursing a swollen head

[Chorus]
Sunshine Sally and Peter Ustinov
Don't like the scene any how
I dropped acid on a Saturday night
Just to see what the fuss was about
Now there goes the neighborhood

[Verse 2]
The photo chick made to look sickly
Is standing in her panties in the shower
She plays the guitar in the bathroom
While the police dust her mother's plastic flowers
And Schoolboy John's in jail
Making a killing through the U.S. mail

[Chorus]
Sunshine Sally and Peter Ustinov
Don't like the scene any how
I dropped acid on a Saturday night
Just to see what the fuss was about
Now there goes the neighborhood

[Verse 3]
This is the movie of the screenplay
Of the book about a girl who meets a junkie
The messenger gets shot down
Just for carrying the message to a flunkie
We can't be certain who the villains are because everyone's so pretty
But the afterparty's sure to be a wing-ding as it moves into your
City

[Chorus]
Sunshine Sally and Peter Ustinov
Don't like the scene any how
I dropped acid on a Saturday night
Just to see what the fuss was about
Now there goes the neighborhood

[Outro]
There goes the neighborhood
There goes the neighborhood

 

[Verse 1]
I spent a year in the mouth of a whale
With a flame and a book of signs
You'll never know how hard I've failed
Trying to make up for lost time
Once I believed in things unseen
I was blinded by the dark
Out of the multitude to me
He came and broke my heart

[Chorus]
When the dust in the field has flown
And the youngest of hearts has grown
And you doubt you will ever be free
Honey, don't bail on me

[Verse 2]
River is wide and oh so deep
And it winds and winds around
I dream we're happy in my sleep
Floating down and down and down

[Chorus]
And the tide rushes by where we stand
And the earth underneath turns to sand
And we're waiting for someone to see
Honey, don't bail on me

[Verse 3]
Tell Ma I loved the man
Even though I turned and ran
Lovely and fine I could have been
Laying down in the palm of his hand
Laying down in the palm of his hand
Laying down in the palm of his hand
Staying down in the palm of his hand

[Chorus]
In the morning you wait for the sun
And secretly hope it won't come
But time washes everyone clean
Buddy now, don't bail on me
Don't bail on me
Don't
Don't bail on me
