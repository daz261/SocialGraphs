Cigarettes and carrot juice
Get yourself a new tattoo
For those sleeveless days of June
I'm sitting on the Cafe Zinho steps
With a book I haven't started yet
Watching all the girls walk by

Could I take you out
I'd be yours without a doubt
On that big dipper
And if the sound of this it frightens you
We could play it real cool
And act somewhat indifferent

And hey June
Why'd you have to come
Why'd you have to come around so soon
I wasn't ready for all this nature
The terrible green, green grass
The violent blooms of flower dresses
And afternoons that make me sleepy

But we could wait awhile
Before we push that dull turnstile
Into the passage
The thousands they have tread
And others sometimes fled
Before the turn came

And we could wait our lives
Before a chance arrives
Before the passage
From the top you can see Monterey
Or think about San Jose
Although I know it's not that pleasant

And hey Jim Kerouac
Brother of the famous Jack
Or so he likes to say, lucky bastard
He's sitting on the cafe's inner steps
With a girl that I'm not over yet
Watching all the world go by

Boy you're looking bad
Did I make you feel that sad?
I'm honestly flattered
But if she asks me out
I'd be hers without a doubt
On that big dipper

A cigarette and carrot juice
And get yourself a new tattoo
For those sleeveless days of June
I'm sitting on the Cafe Zinho steps
I haven't got the courage yet
I haven't got the courage yet
I haven't got the courage yet
