You say your heart is in ruins
No way that it can get worse
I've already done what you're doing
And each time feels like the first

You'll start to lose our of habit
You might even bet that you can't win
Maybe you just never really had it
And I've already lost it time and again

Chorus:
You think you've got something to cry about
You say your heart's got scars that you can't even see
I'll give you something to cry about
'Cause all I've got is a hole where my heart used to be

--- Instrumental ---

I've lost a long line of lovers
And I'd fall for more of the same
You can spend your lifetime looking for others
"Still looking" that's my middle name

Chorus:
You think you've got something to cry about
You say your heart's got scars that you can't even see
I'll give you something to cry about
'Cause all I've got is a hole where my heart used to be

Chorus:
You think you've got something to cry about
You say your heart's got scars that you can't even see
I'll give you something to cry about
'Cause all I've got is a hole where my heart used to be

You think you've got something to cry about
I'll give you something to cry about
You think you've got something to cry about
I'll give you something to cry about...
