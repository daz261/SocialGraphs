[Verse 1]
Call of the wildest
It's got the best of you
Fire in my heart
Fire in my belly too

[Pre-Chorus]
Got a heart and a mind
And a fire inside
And I'm crazy about you

[Chorus]
You, you on your high flying cloud
You, you when you're laughing out loud
You, you with your hidden surprise
You

[Verse 2]
Stoke up the engine
Bring me my driving wheel, driving wheel
Once I get started
You'll know just how I feel

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I'm crazy 'bout you
'Cause I'm crazy 'bout you
'Cause I'm crazy 'bout you

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Gotta get through January, gotta get through February
Gotta get through January, gotta get through February
Gotta get through January, gotta get through February
Gotta get through January

[Verse 3]
Spring in my heart
Fire in my belly too
(Fire in my belly too)
(I come apart baby)
I come apart
(I come apart)
(I don't know what just to do)
Don't know just what to do
(Right on)

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]
You, you on your high flying cloud
You, you when you're laughing out loud
You, you with the stars in your eyes
You, talking 'bout you

[Instrumental]

[Bridge]
I gotta get through January, I gotta get through February
Gotta get through January, I gotta get through February
I gotta get through January, I gotta get to February

[Verse 4]
Spring in my heart, spring in my heart
(Spring in my heart)
Fire, fire in my belly too
(Fire in my belly too)
I come apart
(I come apart baby)
I come apart
(I come apart)
I don't know just what to do
(I don't know what just to do)
(Right on)
(Right on)

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]
You, you on your high flying cloud
You, (you), you when you're laughing out loud
You, (you), you with the stars in your eyes
(You with the stars in your eyes)
Talking 'bout you
(Talking 'bout you)

[Outro]
Talking 'bout you
(Talking 'bout you)
You with the stars in your eyes
(You)
You with your hidden surprise
Talking 'bout you
(Talking 'bout you, talking 'bout you)
Talking 'bout you
Talking 'bout you
(Talking 'bout you)
Talking 'bout you
(Talking 'bout you)
Talking 'bout you

 

[Verse 1]
This weight is weighing on my heart
This weight is tearing us apart
This weight is weighing on my soul
Just won't leave me alone

[Chorus]
You know I'm talking about this weight
You know I'm talking about this weight

[Verse 2]
In the neighbourhood (In the neighbourhood)
People watching me (People watching me)
Got to move to protect my sanity
Anonymity is all I want you see
You may think it's mediocrity, but

[Chorus]
You know I'm talking about this weight
You know I'm talking about this weight

[Bridge]
And the Hollywood ain't no good
I would rather be like Robin Hood
If I could only lose this...

[Chorus]
You know I'm talking about this weight
You know I'm talking about this weight

[Bridge]
And this Hollywood (This Hollywood)
Oh it ain't no good (No good)
I would rather be just like Robin Hood
If I could only lose this...

[Chorus]
You know I'm talking about this weight
You know I'm talking about this weight

[Verse 3]
In the very first it was rock and roll (This weight)
Set me free in body and soul
But this weight is just bringing me down
It's never satisfied every time I go to town

[Chorus]
You know I'm talking about this weight
You know I'm talking about this weight
You know I'm talking about this weight
You know I'm talking about this weight
You know I'm talking about this weight
You know I'm talking about this weight
You know I'm talking about this weight
You know I'm talking about this weight

[Outro]
You know I'm talking about this weight
You know I'm talking about this weight
You know I'm talking about this weight
You know I'm talking about this weight
You know I'm talking about this weight
You know I'm talking about this weight
