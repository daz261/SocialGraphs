Why don't you find a worthwhile cause to channel your energies?
Like finding a solution to starvation and disease
I know that you're concerned about your First Amendment rights
But don't you burn our flag to make your point, that's just not right
If you think you're better off in a different country
Why don't you pack your bags right now
Here's your ticket
It's on me

I've been around this whole wide world and found no better place
And no one's gonna start a fire in my homeland's face
We have a tendency to take our freedom for granted
We have some problems, yes I know
Look at the seed you've planted

[Chorus]
I know that you're aching to be heard
What gives you the famous final word?
To think that your opinion is preferred
What gives you the famous final word?

What other country do you know that pays you without work?
When you need some money, see your welfare officer
There's a lot of other things that you could take a stand about
So you and your activists can take the next train out

[Chorus]

Freedom of speech out of hand
Demonstrations in the land
If you complain a little more
What rights that you have left
Go flying out the door

[Solo]

Why don't you find a worthwhile cause to channel your energies?
Like finding a solution to starvation and disease
With all the problems in this world that are facing us today
We need a concentrated push or in the long run we'll all pay

[Chorus]

 

Maybe if you'd listen than you'd know what I just said
If you think the words I'm singing are why your kids are dead

Maybe could it be that no one was there to hear
Did you pay attention to their angers and their fears?
You're trying to find someone to blame who can't be put on trial
The enemy you're looking for is laughing all the while

[Chorus]
I mourn for those who have been so deceived
You know the last words that they spoke were "Who loves me?"

People in glass houses should not be throwing stones
A sticker on a record won't give your kids a home

So sad it takes someone to die for you to start to care
Your neglect and misguidance have become your nightmare
I hope and pray this tragedy was not all just in vain
Now you can help somebody else avoid the endless pain

[Chorus]
I hope that someday you will stop and realize
Why so many kids have died

Think twice before you point a finger that you may regret
To clear your conscience is your goal, but that is all you'll get
What's done is done, you can't bring them back, Just let go of despair
You keep saying to yourself "If only I'd been there"

[Chorus & Outro 2x]
I mourn for those who have been so deceived
You know the last words that they spoke were "Who loves me?"
I hope that someday you will stop and realize
Just why so many kids have died
