How many girls choose cotton dress worlds
When they could have satins and lace
And stand by her man through good times and bad
And still keep a smile on her face
And how many hearts could face the winters we've known
And still not turn cold
True love travels on a gravel road

Love is a stranger
And hearts are in danger
On smooth streets paved with gold
True love travels on a gravel road

Down through the years we've had hard time and tears
But it only makes our love grow
And we'll stay together
No matter how hard the wind blows
Not once have I seen your blue eyes filled envy
And stray from the warmth that they hold
True love travels on a gravel road

Now love is a stranger
And hearts are in danger
On smooth streets paved with gold
True love travels on a gravel road
True love travels on a gravel road
And it's gonna be rough sometimes
But I want to travel only along the road with you
