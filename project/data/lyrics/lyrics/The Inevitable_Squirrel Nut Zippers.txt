Danny Diamond, she was a star
She took the stage every quarter hour
She was a hottest gig in town, in fact
She was the hottest girl around
She had the strut, she had the lines
To make a man's heart go 'round about
She put it all into her act until
One night after the show
Danny gyrated, wouldn't you know
Something had to go
Down she smack, it was her back
Completely crack, so fade to black
So ends the act of Danny Diamond
She was a star
