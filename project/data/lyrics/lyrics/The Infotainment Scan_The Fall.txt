Le money il sur le table
Il money il sur la table
The palace of excess leads to the palace of access
Hideaway!

I'm lost in music
Feel so alive
Hideaway
Sur la table

I'm lost in music
Caught in a trap
No looking back
Le money il sur la tableau
Brick house refurbishment of pubs in the hideaway.....

I'm lost in music
Caught in a trap
And there's no looking back
I'm lost in music
I'm lost in music
Feel so alive
I quit my ten-to-five
I'm lost in music

I'm lost in music
Lost in music
Hideaway
Snag table top, snag
Dip dip refurbishment of pubs
In the hideaway
And then I heard a voice say
You're lost in music
No turning back
Caught in a trap
You're lost in music
I'm lost in music
Caught in a trap
And there's no looking back
I'm lost in music

L'argent est sur la table, (the money is on the table)
Pris au piege, (trapped)
Inutile de regarder en arriere, (It's useless to look behind you)
Perdu dans la musique, (lost in music)
Cretin, va te faire foutre! (Asshole, fuck you!)

I'm lost in music
Feel so alive
I quit my ten-to-five
I'm lost in music
