[Verse 1]
Nothing but a chemical in my head
It's nothing but laziness
'Cause I don't wanna read the book
I'll watch the movie
'Cause it's not me
I'm just like everybody else my age
I think I'd rather play around
And I think I'd rather watch TV
'Cause I don't wanna face my fears
I'll watch the movie
'Cause it's not me
I'm just like everybody else (I'm just like everybody else)
I'm just like everybody else

[Chorus]
Because
I don't wanna be here
I don't wanna see this now
It's all wrong but it's
Alright
And I don't wanna be here
I don't wanna study now
It's all wrong but it's alright

[Verse 2]
And I don't know what love is
And I don't know who I am
And if I ever wanna find out
I'll watch the movie
'Cause it's not me
I'm just like everybody else my age
I don't wanna change the world
And I don't wanna be someone
And I don't wanna write the book
I'll make the movie
'Cause it's not me
I'm just like everybody else (I'm just like everybody else)
I'm just like everybody else

[Chorus]
I don't wanna be here
I don't wanna see this now
It's all wrong but it's
Alright
And I don't wanna be here
I don't wanna study now
It's all wrong but it's alright
It's alright
