[Intro]
Slow walk
From land mines
It's a coal mine
It's a bad thought

[Chorus]
I'm on my way to God, don't know
My brain's the burger and my heart's the coal

[Verse 1]
I'm trying to get my head clear
I push things out through my mouth, I get refilled through my ears
I get refilled through my ears
I get refilled through my ears
I'm on my way to God, don't know or don't care
My brain's the weak heart and my heart's the long stairs
My heart's the long stairs
My heart's the long stairs
Inland from Vancouver shores
The ravens and the seagulls push each other inward and outward
Inward and outward
In this place that I call home
My brain's the cliff and my heart's the bitter buffalo
My heart's the bitter buffalo
We tore one down and erected another there
The match of the century, absence versus thin air

[Chorus]
On my, on my way to God, don't know
My brain's the burger and my heart's the coal

[Verse 2]
In this life that we call home
The years go fast and the days go so slow
The days go so slow
The days go slow

[Chorus]
I'm on my way to God, don't know
My brain's the burger and my heart's the coal

[Verse 3]
I'm trying to get my head clear
I push things out through my mouth, I get refilled through my ears
I get refilled through my ears
I get refilled...
I'm on my way to God, don't know or even care
My brain's the weak heart and my heart's the long stairs
My heart's the long stairs
My heart's the long stairs
Inland from Vancouver shores
The ravens and the seagulls push each other inward and outward
Inward and outward
In this place that I call home
My brain's the cliff and my heart's the bitter buffalo
My heart's the bitter buffalo
We tore one down and erected another there
The match of the century, absence versus thin air
Absence versus thin air

[Outro]
In this life that we call home
The years go fast and the days go slow
The days go so slow

 

[Verse 1]
Soon the chain reaction started in the parking lot
Waiting to bleed onto the big streets
That bleed out onto the highways
And off to others cities built to store and sell these rocks
Well, aren't you feeling real dirty sitting in the parking lot?
Waiting to bleed onto the big streets
That bleed out onto the highways
And off to other cities built to store and sell these rocks
Well, aren't you feeling real dirty sitting in the parking lot?
Waiting to bleed onto the big streets
That bleed out onto the highways
And off to other cities built to make and store these rocks
Well, aren't you feeling real dirty sitting in your car with nothing?
Waiting to bleed onto the big streets
That bleed out onto the highways
And off to other cities built to store and sell, there's nothing

[Chorus]
Convenient
Parking is way back, way back
Convenient (Convenient)
Parking is way back, way back (Park)
Convenient (Convenient)
Parking is way back, way back

[Verse 2]
Soon the chain reaction started in the parking lot
Waiting to bleed onto the big streets
That bleed out onto the highways
And off to others cities built to store and sell these rocks
Well, aren't you feeling real dirty sitting in the parking lot?
Waiting to bleed onto the big streets
That bleed out onto the highways
And off to other cities built to store these plastic rocks
Well, aren't you feeling real dirty sitting in your car with nothing?
Waiting to bleed onto the big streets
That bleed out onto the highways
And off to other cities built to make and store these rocks
Well, aren't you feeling real dirty sitting in your car with nothing?
Waiting to bleed onto the big streets
That bleed out onto the highways
And off to other cities built to store and sell, there's nothing

[Chorus]
Convenient
Parking is way back, way back
Convenient
Parking is way back, way back
Convenient
Parking is way back, way back

[Verse 3]
Soon the chain reaction started in the parking lot
Waiting to bleed onto the big streets
That bleed out onto the highways
And off to others cities built to store and sell these rocks
Well, aren't you feeling real dirty sitting in the parking lot?
Waiting to bleed onto the big streets
That bleed out onto the highways
And off to other cities built to store and sell these rocks
Well, aren't you feeling real dirty sitting in the parking lot?
Waiting to bleed onto the big streets
That bleed out onto the highways
And off to other cities
