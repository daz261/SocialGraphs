[Verse 1]
I gave you grief, you gave me milk
Your mother's breast, my bed of silk
An itch appears, the time is here
Mamma mia, mamma mia, mamma mia, let me go

[Pre-Chorus]
You take the plunge and she knows, you know
She knows the game and she knows what you're thinking
You're still a child and she knows
She knows, you know, she knows what's best

[Chorus]
You love and you learn
And you cry when you're burned
And you love and you learn
And you laugh 'til it hurts
And you love and you learn
And you wait 'til your turn
And you twist or you stick or you burn

[Verse 2]
I give you trust, you give me lies (She said)
At night, I lie awake, I try (She said)
To understand you, I never planned to
Disappoint you or annoy you
To desert you or destroy you (I said)
I wanna be there for you
I wanna be there for you

[Pre-Chorus]
You take the plunge and she knows, you know
She knows the game and she knows what you're thinking
You're still a child and she knows
She knows, you know, she knows what's best

[Chorus]
You love and you learn
And you cry when you're burned
And you love and you learn
And you laugh 'til it hurts
And you love and you learn
And you wait 'til your turn
And you twist or you stick or you burn

[Bridge]
She needed a chill out
But no one would cool out our mamma
A gun in her hand
And the blood, it spilled out in the sand
She needed a chill out
But no one would cool out our mamma
A gun in her hand
And the blood, it spilled out in the sand
Mother!
Mother!

[Chorus]
You love and you learn
And you cry when you're burned
And you love and you learn
And you laugh 'til it hurst
And you love and you learn
And you wait 'til your turn
And you twist or you stick or you burn

[Outro]
Bring me a piece of my mummy
She was quite close to me
