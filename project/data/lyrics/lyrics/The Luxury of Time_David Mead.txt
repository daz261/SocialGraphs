I saw your eyes as I told you my story
They change from dusk to dawn
Dream visions of mysterious glory
Something sacred so sweet and strong

It hit me in the heart so serious
And I'm serious 'bout a girl like you
The day will have to start vicarious
And vicarious will have to do for now

It's like sweet sunshine baby
Unaffected as a ray of gold
You give me sweet sunshine baby
And I listen as our tale unfolds
I keep hoping for the light and you make it so
It's like sweet sunshine won't let me go

Don't be surprised when you read what I'm writing
It's true as the morning's light
No need to lie about the urges I'm fighting
As I toss through another night

It hit me in the gut so frightening
Yeah it frightens me what a day will do
It starts to wake me up I'm brightening
And I brighten up when I follow through my angel

Give me sweet sunshine baby
Unaffected as a ray of gold
You give me sweet sunshine baby
And I listen as our tale unfolds
I keep hoping for the light and you make it so
It's like sweet sunshine won't let me go

I don't believe it's just another fleeting rush
Yeah, for a moment I felt you beside me
I want to raise the walls I want a trumpet call to remind me
You feel so inviting
You feel so inviting

Sweet sunshine baby
Unaffected as a ray of gold
You give me sweet sunshine baby
I listen as our tale unfolds
I keep hoping for the light and you make it so
It's like sweet sunshine won't let me go
Sweet sunshine
Sweet sunshine
Sweet sunshine
Sweet sunshine

 

To quote a great young poet "love is not a joke", i'm lighting up a smoke
I pull onto the freeway, past and present tense, tryin' to make some sense
As sunset fades again this twilight's dreams begin
What happens in between the start and end
'cos i look at myself in the rearview mirror
Big hair and a broken bone
I wonder out loud why it's hard to breathe
Inside a world of smoke
And what i could use is a touch of mascara
Another name and a foreign home
I wanna cry but i'm prone to laughter
Inside this rolling joke
And miles will make you notice all you dream is real, spinning off your wheels
I have a friend in jesus, i have a friend in maine, i have a friend in me
And i was once like him with no need to pretend
What happens in between the start and end
'cos i look at myself in the rearview mirror
Big hair and a broken bone
I wonder out loud why it's hard to breathe
Inside a world of smoke
And what i could use is a touch of mascara
Another name and a foreign home
I wanna cry but i'm prone to laughter
Inside this rolling joke
And miles will make you notice all you dream is real, all you bleed you'll feel
I pull up at the exit, i turn the car around, i turn the car around
Yeah...
