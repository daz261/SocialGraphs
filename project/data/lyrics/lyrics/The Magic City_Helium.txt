Do you think you'll die when this river runs dry
Took of all of my friends and said goodbye
On a roller(?) with the wind you sleep on high
Between outer space and the sky

Did you ever think that it would end
When I found out how you got messed up with all my friends
Did you think that I would tell a lie
It's been across the ocean in your eye

Over the trees and the Mayfair
With a hundred birds flying in your hair
When you were in the backyard getting high
And I really don't care and I don't know why

In this neverending summer of disease
When we fell asleep and died beneath the trees
Did you ever think that I would lie
I can see the motion in your eye

Sitting on a pinstripe
Blowing like the ocean
Darling I can tell a lie
The queen is behind you
Keep the night at your side
We could dance 'til we die
With you

Cuz we're sitting on a pinstripe
Blowing like the ocean
Darling I would never lie
The queen is behind you
Loves your soft motion
I can't sing this lullaby
Without you
