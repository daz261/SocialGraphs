Good night, sleep tight
The big bright sun has gone away
Done gone away
Goodbye, don't cry
Tomorrow will bring us a brand new day
We can run and play

And they'll laugh up and down the hall
Don't you go shout when you hear them fall
Let them fly across the wall
Let them cry 'til the morning calls
Little two step angel dance

Big night, bright lights
Time now to lay them all to rest
Put 'em all to rest
Bad guys, mean eyes
All gone away to where they belong
Let's just sing our song

And they'll laugh up and down the hall
Don't you go shout when you hear them fall
Let them fly across the wall
Let them cry 'til the morning calls
Little two step angel dance

Good days, new ways
Let go of all things when you sleep
When you're all asleep
Good night, sleep right
Tomorrow is gonna bring us another day
So we can run and play

And they'll laugh up and down the hall
Don't you go shout when you hear them fall
Let them fly across the wall
Let them cry, 'til the morning calls
Little two step angel dance

 

He can't run
He can't play
He does things in a different way
Little John, Little John of God

He tries to speak but no one hears
A little boy's pains and a little boy's fears
Little John, Little John of God

He's come to us from up above
To touch our hearts with special love
With special love, Little John of God

You can say with your eyes
What others only say inside
Little John, Little John of God
Little John, Little John of God
