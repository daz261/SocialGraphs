As I'm looking back in time
My heart was young and the world was mine
Driven by desires blind
I remember someone told me as the years roll by
Remember one thing (one one one day)
The one thing (one one one day)
People come and people go
The way the winds of fortune blow
So hard to find that heart of gold
I remember someone told me
When you find it, don't let go

You're the one thing, you're the one thing, baby
Makes this world heaven, makes the whole thing right
You're the one thing, that means something, baby
The one I believe in, the one thing I need in my life

As I look into your lovin' eyes
There ain't no doubt just where my treasure lies
I've searched the earth for somethin' true
But the only truth that matters is my love for you
And that's the one thing (one one one thing)
The one thing (one one one one thing), oh yeah
Timeless as the stars, faithul as the sea
Like the endless risin' sun I know you'll be there for me
There's so much love inside this heart of mine could break
'Couse I know I've found forever and with every breath I take

You're the one thing, you're the one thing, baby
Makes this world heaven, makes the whole thing right
You're the one thing, that means something, baby
The one I believe in, the one thing I need in my life

And your love is like a rainbow
In a world, that's black and white
You paint my dreams in colours
And in your arms they come alive
You're my every inspiration
You're the wings, that makes me fly
You're my only destination
You're the one thing, the one thing in my life, ooh
(one one one one thing) The one thing (one one one one day) oh yeah

You're the one thing, you're the one thing, baby
Makes this world heaven, makes the whole thing right
You're the one thing, that means something, baby
The one I believe in, the one thing I need in my life

You're the one thing, you're the one thing, baby,oh yea
In my life...That means something, baby...oh ooooh
You're the one thing, that means something, baby
Something in my life...
You're the one thing, the one thing, baby, ooooh
Baby, you're the one, one, one, the one thing...yeah
