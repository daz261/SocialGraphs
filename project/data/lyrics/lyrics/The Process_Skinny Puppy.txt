Spiky, black, hard-edged

Holding his hands
Dream the whole week
Radiance hissing rodent speak
Elective evil once started
Shot struck home so it goes

Inches towards flattened back
On all fours drawn and racked
Doesn't mean a thing

Nature perverts itself so it goes
So what the hell let it grow
Regret so full of haste coming clear
Piss in blood
No one should ever have to

Cut assemble resembled
Played out wording disturbing
Quiet saying relaying
A message raising cain's revenge

Got a few no fucking whacked house of cards dealing smack
Crimson scolding driving told I'm never holding one thing
Back credit full of nothing slither here one thing back
Licking dogs no hook no song feeling high fantasize wonder
Why suck them dry choppy waves take a dive

Crash enable disabled
Effect not carried no power in
Quiet playing resaying never more never again

Distort the monomaniac
Delivering the blow
Core rotten bone

Distort the monomaniac
Black mass held upon the radio
Doesn't mean a thing

Be it what or ever could
Doesn't mean a thing
Sinister creation doesn't mean a thing
Evocation of the dead
Moses forbidding it
Doesn't mean a thing

Worm like ticking art worth shit
We play upon the things we fear
The smell is foul where does it fit
Screw yourself go screw yourself
No one should ever have to

How do you sleep when it's still alive
Never to deep take a look inside

 

Here falls now undone
Looks beyond the credits sum
Livid fractures less of fate
The whisper winds blow the seeds of hate

Disturbed society
Dogs might turn with no values
Intend to raise ability
A tried and tested pointless view
God's got security
Hands like snakes sow the seeds

Raise all negative force-fed
Traces poisons all impure
Profane the haunted heaven
Jeering leapt into the pit of calamity
A mean condition no wealth dents
Provisions for a time unknown
Thelemic gestures are planned and hatched
In seasons of dissolute pain

I cried afflicted and infected
Oblige the system's perfect dream
Distorted my words
Assume all that is programmed before me
And somewhat left unsaid behind shutters

Dirt before desire
Dusted crap ingested comes
Stealing life that you are not visited
Warped torpedo night crawls through
The distant and irrelevant
A good lifeâ€™s experiment fused

I'm laying violent hands upon
A dead card calling cattle
The playthings are so abused
The derelict dial phone clock pusher
Delved in reliving the future too

I'm sticking pins and needles
In this stinging rotten flesh-like substitute
Pieces of half cooked meat that are
Walking on this earth
Abort desire irrelevance ticks in front in view
Ticks in front of you
Ticks in front in view

A candle rhyme to realign
Burnt out shadows on the wall seize the moment
Reach!
