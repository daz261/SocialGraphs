(Brooker / Reid)

Zika nor nama ... hesah!

Through this hourglass
Sands are running fast
In deserted plains
Kingdoms write their names
On these burning sands
Kingdoms show their hands
In these killing fields
Soldiers show their steel
The men who play the gods of war
They stay behind the guarded door
And hostages who seek release
They're crying out to keep the peace

Holding on... Holding on
One day we will be free, one day if we're strong
Holding on... Holding on
Through the shadows cast to a brighter day

In these fields of stone
Far away from home
In this vale of tears
The men who play the gods of war
They stay behind the guarded door
Religious leaders teachin' hate
Praise the war and call it fate

 

I'm a dog in a manger
A cat with a mouse
I'm the prodigal stranger
I'll burn down the house
I'm a self-educator
A collector of news
I'm the cool liberator
Any topic you choose

I'm a man with a mission
I'm a shooting star
I've got no inhibitions
I don't care who you are

Got my eye on the future
And my hand on the pulse
There's a whole world of people
In the back of the bus
There's a man on a tightrope
Who's got nothing to share
Just a whole lot of secrets
And a head full of air

I'm a man with a mission
I'm a shooting star
I've got no inhibitions
I don't care who you are

It's the Tropic of Cancer
The meaning of soul
There's a change in the weather
To have and to hold
The method of access
A handful of dust
It's just par for the course, boy
Get back on the bus

I'm a man with a mission
I'm a shooting star
I've got no inhibitions
I don't care who you are
