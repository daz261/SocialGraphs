Heads down they walk away
And all the while I vent myself
Face to face with her again
That's OK I cured myself

Cure the sane, they are all to blame
Cure the sane, they don't know what they're missing

Talking to the nothing again
Making sure the nothing hears
Making sense to no one else
Is fine with me it's all so clear
Parts will seem a bit confusing
So what, I don't care
Seems to me you need the change
Go on and cut your hair

Man they sure are fast today
Making me nervous, that's OK
Faster now and I'm still here
Use the vice or make the tear

Cure the sane, they are all to blame
Cure the sane, they all wish they could be as vain
Cure the sane, we're the same
Cure the sane, they don't know what they're missing

Make a list of all your problems
A twisted head can make you smile
Come to find companions living
Here and there in denial
I've been this way for all my life
I'm sure my friends could use the rest
Thinking that they all need help
It's no good but do your best
Spreading yourself way too thin
Does it hurt to see it all
Well enough to count the days
Stronger now you take the fall

Cure the sane, they are all to blame
Cure the sane, they all wish they could be as vain
Cure the sane, we're the same
Cure the sane, they don't know what they're missing

Pass the bones and cigarettes
No dessert for me today
Don't be comin' around again
It's not OK to cure yourself

 

Frown down upon the days
When I was someone's puppet
Hear the sound of cries that weighed
So heavy as I suffered

A master plan for killing off
All we take for granted
Haunting ones who would not believe
In what you wanted

To find a friend, to free you from
The clutch of your black halo
Seem to find all the comfort
Knowing no tomorrow

Someone tell me just what have we become
Master of nothing, slave to the numb

Leaving a trace, you've seen the scars
Of all that we've been through
How many times has it fallen apart
Reminding me of you

You wanted it, you wanted it
A power plan, to feel alive
To save a soul, have control
But knowing no tomorrow

Someone tell me just what we have become
Master of nothing, slave to the numb
