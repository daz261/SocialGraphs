(Travis Tritt)

Tell me why do you love to make me cry
Is there a reason why you treat me so unkind
It seems you try to hurt me with everything you do
I guess you could call me crazy 'cause I'm still in love with you

Tell me why is your heart as cold as ice
Oh is there a demon hidden just behind your eyes
Well I dream someday you'll love me but that dream just don't come true
But that don't keep me from wishin' 'cause I'm still in love with you

There was a time I thought my love would set you free
But now you say all that's binding you is me
How can that be

Tell me why do I go on believing your lies
And why everytime you hurt me that I'm always so surprised
I know that I should give up, find somebody new
But it's a hopeless situation 'cause I'm still in love with you

Girl there was a time I thought my love would set you free
But now you say all that's binding you is me
Girl how can that be

Tell me why do I go on believing your lies
And why everytime you hurt me that I'm always so surprised
I know that I should give up, find somebody new
But it's a hopeless situation 'cause I'm still in love with you
Oh girl still in love with you
'Cause I'm still in love with you
