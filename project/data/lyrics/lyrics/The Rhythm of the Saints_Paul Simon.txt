[Verse 1]
A family of musicians took shelter for the night
In the little harbor church of St. Cecilia
Two guitars, bata, bass drum and tambourine
Rose of Jericho and bougainvillea

[Pre-Chorus]
This is a lonely life
Sorrows everywhere you turn
And that's worth something
When you think about it
That's worth some money
That's worth something
When you think about it
That is worth some money

[Verse 2]
A trip to the market
A trip into the pearl gray morning sunlight
That settles over washington
A trip to the market
A trip around the world
Where the evening meal
Is negotiable, if there is one

[Pre-Chorus]
This is a lonely, lone, lonely life
Sorrows everywhere you turn
And that's worth something
When you think about it
That's worth some money
That's worth something
When you think about it
That is worth some money

[Chorus]

To prove that I love you
Because I believe in you
Summer skies, stars are falling
All along the injured coast
And if I have money
If I have children
Summer skies, stars are falling
All along the injured coast
Oo-wah oo-wah doo-wop a doo-wah
Summer skies, the stars are falling
All along the injured coast
Oo-wah oo-wah doo-wop a doo-wah
Summer skies, the stars are falling

[Verse 3]
We are standing in the sunlight
The early morning sunlight
In the harbor church of St. Cecilia
To praise a soul's returning to the earth
To the rose of Jericho and the bougainvillea

[Pre-Chorus]
This is the only life
And that's worth something
When you think about it
That's worth some money
That's worth something
When you think about it
That is worth some money

[Chorus]
To prove that I love you
Because I believe in you
Summer skies, stars are falling
All along the injured coast
And if I have money
If I have children
Summer skies, stars are falling
All along the injured coast
If I have weaknesses
Don't let them blind me now
Summer skies, stars are falling
All along the injured coast
Oo-wah oo-wah
Doo wop a doo wah
Summer skies, the stars are falling
Leaving the shadow of the valley behind me now
All along the injured coast

[Outro]
Ooh-wah oow-wah
Doo wop a doo wah
Summer skies and stars are falling
All along the injured coast
Ooh-wah ooh-wah
Doo wop a doo wah

 

[Verse 1]
Soon our fortunes will be made, my darling
And we will leave this loathsome little town
Silver bells jingling from your black lizard boots, my baby
Silver foil to trim your wedding gown
It's true the tools of love wear down
Time passes
A mind wanders
It seems mindless, but it does
Sometimes I see your face
As if through reading glasses
And your smile seems softer than it was

[Chorus]
Proof
Some people gonna call you up
Tell you something that you already know
Proof
Sane people go crazy on you
Say ''no man, that was not
The deal we made
I got to go, I got to go''
Faith
Faith is an island in the setting sun
But proof, yes
Proof is the bottom line for everyone

[Verse 2]
My face, my race
Don't matter anymore
My sex, my cheques
Accepted at the door

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Half moon hiding in the clouds, my darling
And the sky is flecked with signs of hope
Raise your weary wings against the rain, my baby
Wash your tangled curls with gambler's soap

[Chorus]

 

There may come a time when you'll be tired
As tired as a dream that wants to die
Further to fly
Further to fly
Further to fly
Further to fly

Maybe you will find a love that you discover accidentally
Who falls against you gently as a pickpocket
Brushes your thigh
Further to fly

Effortless music from the Cameroons
The spinning darkness of her hair
A conversation in a crowded room going nowhere
The open palm of desire wants everything
It wants everything
It wants everything

Sometimes I'll be walking down
The street and I'll be thinking am I crazy
Or is this some morbid little lie?
Further to fly
Further to fly
Further to fly

A recent loss of memory
A shadow in the family
The baby waves bye-bye
I'm trying, I'm flying

There may come a time
When I will lose you
Lose you as I lose my light
Days falling backward into velvet night

The open palm of desire wants everything
It wants everything
It wants soil as soft as summer
And the strength to push like spring

A broken laugh, a broken fever
Take it up with the great deceiver
Who looks you in the eye
And says baby don't cry
Further to fly

There may come a time
When I will lose you
Lose you as I lose my sight
Days falling backward into velvet night

The open palm of desire
The rose of Jericho
Soil as soft as summer
And the strength to let you go
