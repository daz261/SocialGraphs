[Verse 1: Willie Nelson]
I'm gonna live forever
I'm gonna cross that river
I'm gonna catch tomorrow now
[Kris Kristofferson]
You're going to want to hold me
Just like I always told you
You're going to miss me when I'm gone

[Chorus]
Nobody here will ever find me
But I will always be around
Just like the songs I leave behind me
I'm gonna live forever now

[Verse 2: Waylon Jennings]
You fathers and you mothers
Be good to one another
Please try to raise your children right
[Johnny Cash]
Don't let the darkness take them
Don't make them feel forsaken
Just lead them safely to the light

[Chorus]
Nobody here will ever find me
But I will always be around
Just like the songs I leave behind me
I'm gonna live forever now

[Outro]
I'm gonna live forever
I'm gonna cross that river
I'm gonna catch tomorrow now

I'm gonna live forever
I'm gonna cross that river
I'm gonna catch tomorrow now

I'm gonna live forever
I'm gonna cross that river
I'm gonna catch tomorrow now
