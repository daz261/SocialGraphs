Once upon a time ago
Way up in the land of sleet and snow
How this fairy tale would go
I could not have known

I had searched around this world so mean
From Livingston to Palestine
Trying to pursue my dream of love

Well, it was then I met this girl so fine
She made me think so fast, I left my thoughts behind
And I tried to pass for a sophisticated Northern man

I said, "Why yes, my dear I know exactly what you mean
Because there's not so much I haven't done or seen
And may I say your eyes are the loveliest shade of jade"

I said, "Come on, baby
Well, come on, baby
Oooh, come on, baby"

Well, it was then I knew I had made my first mistake
She did not even start to wait
And as she turned around to walk away
This is what she had to say:

She told me, "Man, I come from way down South
I've got a picket fence with a picket house
And I don't need no fast talking Northern man like you around"

I said, "Well, come on baby
Oh, come on, baby
Oooh, come on, baby

Well, honey, I don't know what you just heard
But Alabama is my favorite word
And Birmingham is a long way from here"

I could see the light begin to shine
She turned back around her eyes met mine
And suddenly the whole world became a
A better place

Even if it was only for an instant
Because it was then I knew I had made my
Second mistake

She told me, "Man, that was a real good try
But Alabama's not where I reside
I come from where the river is wide
And the crawfish hide"

I said, "Well, come on, baby
Oh, come on, baby
Oooh, come on, baby

Well, honey, I don't know what you just heard
But Louisiana is my favorite word
And New Orleans is a long way from here"

She just looked at me and shook her head
"Your lines are pretty sad," she said
"You are a lonely, weak, pathetic man
If this is doing the best you can"

It was then I knew I had made my third mistake
Yes, three strikes right across the plate
And as I hollered, "Honey, please wait!"
She was gone

I said, "Well, come on, baby
Well, come on, baby
Ooooh, come on, baby

Honey, I don't know what you just heard
'Bartender, set 'em up' are my favorite words
Because the love I need
Is a long way from here

Oh, the love I need
Is a long way from here"

Yes, well, there I sat so all alone
Like a king who sits upon his throne
And whose kingdom may have just gone home
With another kingdom

So as you can imagine, much to my surprise
When the door was flung back open wide
It was a miracle
She walked inside
And pulled her chair up next to me

And that's when she knew
She had made her
First mistake

Honey, I don't know just what you heard
But "Come on, baby"
Are my favorite words
And where we're going
Is a long way from here

And where we're going to
Is a long way from here

So like I said before
I could not have known
How this fairy tale would finally go
Still the only certain thing for sure
Is what I do not know

So like the years and all the seasons pass
And like the sand runs through the hour glass
I just keep on running faster
Chasing the happily
I am ever after

I just keep on running faster
Chasing the happily
I am ever after

 

[Verse 1]
Way down yonder on the bayou
There lives a little girl-o
Skin so pale
Six feet high
Skinny as a rail
Just one eye

[Chorus]
She's the one-eyed Fiona
She's the one-eyed Fiona
She's the one-eyed Fiona
She's the one-eyed Fiona

[Verse 2]
Her daddy gone to heaven
Her mama won't like you
Her brother he's crazy
He just might bite you
Her sister she's pretty
But she just won't do

[Chorus]
She's the one-eyed Fiona
She's the one-eyed Fiona
She's the one-eyed Fiona
She's the one-eyed Fiona

[Bridge]
Oh you can say she gonna love you
Because you made a little voodoo
Oh but what they didn't tell you
Is it ain't up to you dude

[Verse 3]
You better not cross her
You try to boss her
Then you better duck Mister
Here come a cup and saucer

[Chorus]
She's the one-eyed Fiona
She's the one-eyed Fiona
She's the one-eyed Fiona
She's the one-eyed Fiona

[Verse 4]
So if you're going to the bayou
Man I'll tell you all I know
She's got skin so pale
She's six feet high
And she'll look right through you
With just one eye

[Chorus]
She's the one-eyed Fiona
She's the one-eyed Fiona
She's the one-eyed Fiona
She's the one-eyed Fiona
