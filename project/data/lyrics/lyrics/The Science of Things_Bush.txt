Whatever she wants from me
Whatever device
Whether in kindness
Whether in spite
What can I say
What can I do
I can't help myself
I let the monster through

Wherever she sends me
Wherever the plane
Perfect black dress
Perfect grave
What can I say
What can I do
I did it to myself
I did it all confused

Jesus online
Wires around the world
Feel invincible
Computer car and girl
Jesus online
Wires around the world
Feel invincible
To be perfect just like you
To be perfect just like you

Whenever she comes with me
Whenever we break
Dress up my apathy
Pretend we're great, great, great

Jesus online
Wires around the world
Feel invincible
Computer car and girl
Jesus online
Jesus online
Jesus, Jesus
Jesus

Jesus online
Arms around the world
Feel invincible
To be perfect just like you
To be perfect just like you
Jesus, Jesus online
Jesus

To be perfect just like you
To be perfect just like you
To be perfect just like you
To be perfect just like you
To be perfect just like you
To be perfect just like you
To be perfect just like you
