It's coming through the air
For all of us to hear
Could it be the sounds of liberation
Or just the image of detention?

We want the airwaves back
We want the airwaves back
We don't just want airtime
We want all the time all of the time

We want the airwaves back
We want the airwaves back
We don't just want transmission
We want...

What frequency are you getting?
Is it noise or sweet sweet music?
What frequency will liberation be?
What frequency will liberation be?

It's coming through the air
For all of us to hear
Could it be the sounds of liberation
Or just the image of detention?
Control my flower
Business, news all ready to devour
Who's in charge and what does he say?
Is he playing the alternative or does it sound the same old way?

We want the airwaves back
We want the airwaves back
We want transmission for the people (by the people)
We mean...

We wanted everything
We needed everything
We needed everything

What frequency are you getting?
Is it noise or sweet sweet music?
What frequency will liberation be?
What frequency? What frequency?

What frequency are you getting?
Is it noise or sweet sweet sweet sweet sweet?
What frequency will liberation be?
What frequency? What frequency? What frequency?

We want the airwaves back
We want the airwaves back
We don't just want airtime
We want all the time all of the time

What frequency are you getting?
Is it noise or sweet sweet music?
What frequency will liberation be?
What frequency will liberation be?

What frequency are you getting?
Is it noise or sweet sweet sweet?
What frequency will liberation be?
What frequency? What frequency?

[Spoken:]
We got more coming, right now. There's more coming
We're gonna get, gonna get a little sort of a session going here
A bit of a session, a session that will feature the rhythm section
