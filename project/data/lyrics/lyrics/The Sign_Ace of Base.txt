Oh, oh, oh

We are much too young and life's so big
We don't know yet what the future brings
In it's hands for us
What tomorrow brings the future knows

No matter what you say
No matter what you do
We are united

Young and proud
Young and proud
We are marching on the same side of destiny
On the same side of destiny

Chorus:
Anyway anyway you do it (wrong)

I'm calling out your name
But you never hear me
Anyway anyway you do it (wrong)
I'm giving you my love no it's never for sex

And we're so young and proud
Oh anyway anyway you do it (wrong)

I'm calling out your name
(repeat 3x)

Oh anyway anyway you do it (wrong)

I'm calling out your name
(repeat 5x)

(chorus, repeat 3x)
