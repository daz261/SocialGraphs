Homer: Born under a bad sign
Been down since I began to crawl
If it wasn't for bad luck
You know, I wouldn't have no luck at all

Hard luck and trouble
Been my only friend
I been on my own
Ever since I was ten

Born under a bad sign
I been down since I began to crawl
If it wasn't for bad luck
You know, I wouldn't have no luck at all

I don't like to read
I can hardly write
My whole life has been
One big fight

Born under a bad sign
I been down since I began to crawl
If it wasn't for bad luck
I said I wouldn't have no luck at all
And that ain't no lie

(Guitar solo)

You know, if it wasn't for bad luck
I wouldn't have no kind of luck
If it wasn't for real bad luck
I wouldn't have no luck at all

You know beer and bowling
Is all I crave
A big bag of pork rinds
Gonna carry me to my grave

Born under a bad sign
I been down since I began to crawl
If it wasn't for bad luck
I tell ya I wouldn't have no luck at all

Good take boys, yeah
I think now that I'm a blues singer, I should have some kind of name
How 'bout Muddy Simpson. No. Big Homer. T-Bone Homer
Blind Lemon Simpson. Blind Lemon-lime Homer. Blind Grapefruit Homer
Blind Strawberry Alarm Clock Homer. No that's... they used that
