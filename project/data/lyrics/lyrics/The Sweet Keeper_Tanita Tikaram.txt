[Verse 1]
Well, he said it like he meant it
But he did not really care
So I sat upon the eve's embraces
I was never there

No, I was never really fabled
I was never really lost
I was cunning through this habit of mine
You see, all the words were lost
Yes, all the words were lost

[Verse 2]
And you can stand upon your own life
Say it always seemed to seal
There were smiles upon the picture
But I don't know what to feel

And I told a million stories
And I sat down to risk half
But I never really meant it
'Til you came and stole my heart away
You came and stole my heart away

[Pre-Chorus]
And even if your real thought hid
A thousand words away
And even if you never knew
It all came back today

[Chorus]
It all, all, all, all
All came back today
It all, all, all, all
All came back today

[Verse 3]
Well, the rain scales up
Your soul is drowned
Mother's sayings still raise a frown and
Mother's sayings still make you see
What you have lost instead of me

[Pre-Chorus]
And even if your real thought hid
A thousand words away
And even if you never knew
It all came back today

[Chorus]
It all, all, all, all
All came back today
It all, all, all, all
All came back today

[Verse 4]
And even though the starlight falls
And takes your breath away
You still stare up towards the toss
Hey, I don't know what to say

I don't know how to be alone with
Some kind, fretless friend
And even though the harvest brings
Well, we all begin again
Yes, we all begin again

[Pre-Chorus]
And even if your real thought hid
A thousand words away
And even if you never knew
It all came back today

[Chorus]
It all, all, all, all
All came back today
It all, all, all, all
All came back today

[Bridge]
I would like this sun
Be spoke until I find
I was all remembrance
Until the words got tired

[Verse 5]
And even if your war grows stale
You got nothing left
I caught the stylus
The sun, the sources
There is a second breath
To take, yes
There is a second

[Outro]
Ay lay-lay lay
Lay lay lay
Ay lay-lay lay la-lum

[humming]

 

[Verse 1]
As always, I stop to speak
Some girls like to say their piece
As always, I turn to you
Don't understand what you're doing
And

[Chorus]
Light up this town
Grow weary and back down
It's such an amazing sight
To be found

Little sister leaving town

[Verse 2]
Says the poet, "I won't grass"
Some things are better left and not taken to task
I guess I knew she was a rose
She knows what hurts and how to hold

If your daddy he turned round
Let the grass around him scream the sound
I'm so sorry for these tales you're telling
Sometimes you can't account

[Chorus]
Light up this town
Grow weary and back down
It's such an amazing sight
To be found
Little sister leaving town

[Verse 3]
Sometimes it's absurd
A minor triumph when you hear the words
"I'm just trying to stake my place
No real fears upon this face"

And my wishes nobody says
All the [?] when I cross the days
I'm just holding back for you
Sometimes that helps to

[Chorus]
Light up this town
Grow weary and back down
It's such an amazing sight
To be found
Little sister leaving town

 

[Verse 1]
You know it's alright
Just to take me home
To your serious house
With your serious tones

You're a serious man
With a serious smile
But the summer is hot
And I might surprise you

[Verse 2]
In a very short while
We'll have left them behind
With their faces quite pained
As they try to remind themselves

Oh, it's really so wrong
It's really so out
And it's really not cool
To take a young girl about

And I know the young man
With a century's face
A philosopher king
He will try to amaze

With examples of love
And examples of hate
And to see them explode
We will just have to—

[Chorus]
It's a simple love story
It grows better all the time
You can tell me all about it
But first I'll tell you about mine

[Verse 3]
You know it's alright
To be trustful; have tact
But the problem's complex
When you keep holding back

We could talk for an hour
We could talk for a day
But the people we know
Will still have their say

Talk of such virtuous women
Talk of such noble men
But if I'm on the level
I have met none of them

Oh, I've met troubled people
With deep and dark thoughts
Who have hallowed my name
And sworn I will get caught

But why waste real feeling
And why waste our time
To let the earth bow
To no virtue of—

[Chorus]
It's a simple love story
It grows better all the time
You can tell me all about it
But first I'll tell you about mine

[Verse 4]
You know it's alright
Just to make mistakes
But to tail it with hurt
Is the gravest make

We all create lives
Which we don't understand
But to point the accused
Is a job for no man

And we curse our own longing
And curse our own ways
I won't be satisfied
With my soul that's—

[Chorus]
It's a simple love story
It grows better all the time
You can tell me all about it
Now I've told you about mine
