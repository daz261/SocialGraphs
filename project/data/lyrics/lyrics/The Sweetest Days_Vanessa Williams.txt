[Chorus:]
It's just the way that you love me
(You know you drive me crazy)
It's just the way that you love
(You know you drive me crazy)

I've been waiting for this moment secretly
Counting every minute
Every hour till you're with me
'Cause I know just what's in store
And now I'm in your arms, baby close the door

[Verse 1:]
Why waste another minute
Ooh, let's get right to it
Baby turn the lights down
And we don't have to say a word

Unspoken pleasure
There's no way to measure
How you make me feel
When you're near me and whisper softly
So don't stop

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Verse 2:]
And it seems time flies
Whenever I'm in your arms
I like to savor every second
You thrill me with your charm

Now I'm lost in the passion
(Moment, feelings, magic) we share
And when I look into your eyes
I know how much you care

Don't wanna rush the feeling
'Cause loving you's so real and
I like the way you set the mood
With a little wine and candlelight

It's more than emotion
Let's keep this fire going
Now we're lost inside our love
(Now we're drifting into love)
Sweet surrender is so tender

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Bridge:]
Ooh, you know me oh so well
You always take your time
And you always get it right
(You know just what I like)

Ooh, you set my soul on fire
And I know you've got my rhythm
Cause then you take me higher

[Repeat Chorus x3:]

Don't you stop, stop the love
You know you've got the rhythm
Don't you stop, stop the love
You know you've got the rhythm

 

[Verse 1:]
I saw you with that girl last night
The both of you were making eyes
You did it right in front of my face
As if I had no pride

And now you're always working late
You never have much time for me
And you're expecting me to believe
That you're not out with she... please!

Tonight I give you my surprise
I hope that you won't mind
I'm giving you an eye for an eye

Baby, I've found another
And he is my lover
And I'm going out for the rest of your life

[Chorus:]
I betcha never thought I'd go that far
I betcha never thought I'd break your heart
I betcha never even thought at all
I betcha never, no you never

[Verse 2:]
I know that everybody lies
That I know I can't deny
But what if they're intentional
The intention of your crime

'Cause I know how much I can take
I know my heart demands a change
If I can't have my way, then all I have to say

Tonight, I give you my surprise
In return for all the lies
I'm giving you an eye for an eye

Baby, I've found another
And he is my lover
And we're going out for the rest of your life

[Repeat Chorus:]
