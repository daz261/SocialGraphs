Every one of us has heard the call
Brothers of true metal
Proud and standing tall
We know the power within us
Has brought us to this hall
There's magic in the metal
There's magic in us all

Heavy metal or no metal at all
Wimps and posers, leave the hall
Heavy metal or no metal at all
Wimps and posers, go on, get out
Leave the hall

Now the world must listen to our decree
We don't turn down for anyone
We do just what we please
Got to make it louder
All men play on ten
If you're not into metal
You are not my friend

Heavy metal or no metal at all
Wimps and posers, leave the hall
Heavy metal or no metal at all
Wimps and posers, I said leave the hall

Now the world must listen to our decree
We don't turn down for anyone
We do just what we please
Got to make it louder
All men play on ten
If you're not into metal
You are not my friend

There's metal in the air tonight
Can you hear it call?
If you ain't got the balls to take it
You can leave the hall

Heavy metal or no metal at all
Wimps and posers, leave the hall
Heavy metal or no metal at all
Wimps and posers, go on, leave the hall
Heavy metal or no metal at all
Wimps and posers, leave the hall
Heavy metal or no metal at all
Wimps and posers, leave the hall

Heavy metal or no metal at all
Wimps and posers, leave the hall
Heavy metal or no metal at all
Wimps and posers, leave the hall

 

Demon's blood and dragon's fire
Falling on my wings
Racing to the battle in the sky
Ancient Gods are calling me
I hear them when they sing
Of all the heroes who wait for me to die

Beneath the cloak of magic
I'll meet them in the air
I am invisible, I move without a sound
They look, but cannot find me
They think that I'm not there
With a spell I send them
Crashing to the ground

Wait for me, dragon
We'll meet in the sky
By fire and magic I am sworn
Hell is calling, we cannot be denied
Fly to the blackness of the storm
We must die to be reborn

I wear a sacred talisman
I make a secret sign
Now, welcome me into this wicked wind
On the journey of a shaman
A dragon I must ride
The gates of Hell are open, let me in

Rule in Hell or serve in Heaven
Choose an altar or a throne
All commandments and
Laws of man disown
Now, eat the fruit of knowledge
Unto no-one ye atone
Into the fire with your soul

Wait for me, dragon
We'll meet in the sky
By fire and magic I am sworn
Hell is calling, we cannot be denied
Fly to the blackness of the storm
We must die to be reborn

Demon's blood and dragon fire
Falling on my wings
Racing to the battle in the sky
Ancient Gods are calling me
I hear them when they sing
Of all the heroes who wait for me to die

Beneath the cloak of magic
I'll meet them in the air
I am invisible, I move without a sound
They look, but cannot find me
They think that I'm not there
With a spell I send them
Crashing to the ground

Wait for me, dragon
We'll meet in the sky
By fire and magic I am sworn
Hell is calling, we cannot be denied
Fly to the blackness of the storm

Wait for me, dragon
We'll meet in the sky
By fire and magic I am sworn
Hell is calling, we cannot be denied
Fly to the blackness of the storm

Wait for me, dragon
We'll meet in the sky
By fire and magic I am sworn
Hell is calling, we cannot be denied
Fly to the blackness of the storm
We must die to be re, die to be re
Die to be reborn
