Was a time when I had nothing to explain
Oh, this mess I have made
But then things got complicated
My innocence has all but faded
Oh, this mess I have made

And I don't believe in God
So I can't be saved
All alone, as I've learned to be
In this mess I have made

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

All the untested virtue
The things I said I'd never do
Least of all to you
I know he's kind and true
I know that he is good to you
He'll never care for you more than I do

But I don't (No, I don't)
Believe in love
So I can't (So I can't)
Be tamed (Be saved)
All alone as I've learned to be
In this mess (In this mess)
I have made
The same mistakes
Over and over again

There are rooms in this house that I don't open anymore
Dusty books and pictures on the floor
But she will never see
She'll never see that part of me
I want to be for her
What I could never be for you

And I don't (No, I don't)
Believe in God
So I can't (So I can't)
Be saved (Be saved)
All alone as I've learned to be
In this mess (In this mess)
I have made
Ooh
