Life
With its wonderful smells
With its enchanting plant life
With its exhilarating animal life
With its perplexing micro-orgasmic life
And so on

Life
With its amazing sensations
With its scintilating sounds
With its vivacious visions
With its yummy tastes
And so on

Life
With its natural elements
Its unnatural elements
And all its other elements
And so on

Life
With its death, with its birth
With its girth, with its earth
With its stars and its bars and its buildings
And poison and power
And flowers and showers
And children and viruses
And get rich quick schemes
And all that other life stuff
And so on and so forth and so on

This is life
The one you get
So go and have a ball

This is life
Don't worry, it will kill you
Don't worry, it's delicious
Don't worry
It'll all be over sooner than Shiva can open an eye

A circle
Whose center is everywhere
And whose circumference
Is nowhere
