[Verse 1:]
I wanna get deeper
Deeper than skin
I wanna be more than
Just another friend
I'm ready to love you
With all of my heart
But I won't give it if you
Can't do your part

[Chorus:]
A little bit just ain't it
Give me all
A little love is not enough
Give me all

[B-Section:]
Need your lovin'
Need your kissin'
Don't want nothin'
To be missin'

[Verse 2:]
You're givin' me portions
You wanna move fast
What you're giving
Ain't never gonna last
I wanna be closer
I need to have more
'Cause I'm gonna love you
Like no one before

[Chorus]

[B-Section]

[Bridge:]
I'm on fire babe
You wanna build me up
Just to let me down

 

Sitting by the telephone
Waiting for a bell to ring
I don't want another call
I just want to hold you

I'm givin' my everything
Givin' all my time
So darlin', darlin', darlin', darlin' call
Won't you call me boy

I'll go anywhere you want
I'll be anything you say
All I want is to feel your arms around me

I'm givin' my everything
Givin' all my time
So darlin', darlin', darlin', darlin' please
(Won't you)

Stay with me baby
Stay here for a little while
Won't you say you'll stay here for the night
Stay right here with me sweet baby
Stay here for a little while
For a while

I'm sitting at my window
And I look
Where are you

I wonder if you even know
You belong to me
No matter where you roam
You've got to take me

I'm givin' my everything
Givin' all my time
So darlin', darlin', darlin', darlin' please
(Won't you)

Even if I have to wait all night
I don't even care
I've waited all my life
Let me love you

I'm givin' my everything
Givin' all my time
So darlin', darlin', darlin', darlin' please
(Won't you)
