Yeah...!
In a world of hate pollution
We can't breathe anymore
We've to leave and this time you
The pawn, have won
On our quest for nowhere island
We set off to the sea
You call surrender what we call a calm
Before the storm...

Pounding thoughts of home they make me know:
"I will return! I don't live my life for you
It's too short to get burned
Stand upright and face the wind!"

Time to go back where I belong...
No one can prevent me
From raising towers in Babylon
Time to go back where I belong...
No one can accuse me
For I do not fear
Babylon!
Babylon...!

You only can love me if you can convert me
To attitudes of your brain
You blame us for doing things
That you don't know
You tell me what you'd do
If you were me, but you are you and I am I
Lucky you, but this time I say: "No!"

Pounding thoughts of home they make me know:
"I will return!"
I don't want to hurt you
But you'll have to learn:
You are you and I am I!

Time to go back where I belong...
No one can prevent me
From raising towers in Babylon
Time to go back where I belong...
No one can accuse me
For I do not fear
Babylon!

Time to go
Back where I belong...
No one can prevent me
From raising towers in Babylon

Time to go
Back where I belong...
No one can prevent me
From raising towers in Babylon

Time to go
Back where I belong...
No one can prevent me
From raising towers in Babylon

Time to go
Back where I belong...
No one can accuse me
For I do not fear
Babylon!

 

Longing for silence...
"Always faster" is the way that we go
Not a little patience...
Higher, farer, better we grow

The beast is rising. It's tantalizing
Those who are taking the time
Alienation... A revelation...
Straight to the end of the line...

The cold Chill you feel is no dream it's for real
We don't follow!

Fly! Riding away... Rising today...
No we don't play your headless game!
We are alive, don't say goodbye
Fly! Riding away... Rising today...
No we don't play your headless game!
We are alive, don't say goodbye

Cast out from Eden...
You don't like what we are in your eyes
We're leading the treason on the race you run
The way of your life

I am danger, I'm a stranger
Cause I don't give in to your call
And not until she is satisfied
We can come and explode and we fall!!!

We're blowing the frame of your headless game:
We don't follow!

Fly! Riding away... Rising today...
No we don't play your headless game!
We are alive, don't say goodbye
Fly! Riding away... Rising today...
No we don't play your headless game!
We are alive, don't say goodbye
