She gives just the tiniest glimpse
As her eyelids dip
Itâ€™s because

She took just a tiny sip
Now she's starting to trip
It's because

But now she can look so mean
As she makes my scene
I'm in love

She dances past the color scheme
I'm in tangerine
Just because
I wonder what she sees in you

But she can make him still
As he pulls the bill
From his jeans

The bells running up the poles
Just to get the cold
Of her scream

She says she's mistreated too

I don't care why she cries
'Cause you're the one she's lying to

So sad

She says she's mistreated by you
Don't care why she cries
'Cause you're the one she's lying

Makes me wonder why
Why she's got to be so cruel

I wonder what's got into you
Don't care why she cries
'Cause you're the one she's lying to

Makes me wonder why
Why she's got to be so cruel
