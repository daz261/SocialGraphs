Long before what is black was blackened

O, long before
Blooms of gray made mother lovely
Mother ain't lovely no more
And long before the house was leaning

O, long before
The corridor of box woods lined the entrance
Box woods ain't there no more
Dad burned the box woods
And like to burned the house
But one came wandering and beat daddy down

O, long before
Long before this road seemed knotted

O, long before
There was but one path dim and cozy
Path don't seem to be no more
And long before you were my sister

O, long before
Gals in town they called me mister
Ain't no girl call on me no more
I cut the card loosewise
Were you not my only dream?
Give the hero his house
He and ma live in sin

O, long before
And long before you were an artwork

O, long before
Mama suckled you on her holy breast
Mama's breast ain't holy no more
Long before we shared a shortsheet

O, long before
I stood above you as you slept
I don't stand above no more

We won little mobile
And won filthy path
And will drift along tongueless unhappiness at last
Will last
And last
Till we see fit to stand before
That virgin cunt, that sainted whore
Whose piss we have slept under
Whose smell we have bore
Is her heelprint that marks our faces?

O, long before

 

I tried to stay healthy for you
I stayed at cane's length from peril
But lonely threads constrict my heart
As you perch on that barrel

Sing to them all and I'll stand by
Though jealousy it threatens
Smoke's around my blackened lungs
It is my only weapon

I hate these bags beneath my eyes
I know when your song's over
You'll come back to this bed of ours
And be my only lover

The carnal thoughts they are beyond us
A man I am but only
To be your faithful other half
That neither one be lonely

Cold and old and here today
Our faces melt together
I would I had the means to make
Our persons one together

We are you and me and so it is
