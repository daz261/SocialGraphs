Try but you can't bring me down
Try but you can't let me
Try but you can't bring me down
Try

I've come too far now
To ever close my eyes
Made my mistakes
And I wear no disguise
I speak my mind and let the rumors
Twist the worlds around
Some try so hard, but no one gets me down

I get so stressed out
I keep running out of time
I'll do my best to make
A better life
I feel your doubt and I don't even
Wonder why
Got it figured out
All I have to do is try

When times get tough, I'll rise above
Can't get me down, no you can't
Let me down, I made my mistakes
Wear no disguise, I've come too far now
To ever close my eyes
