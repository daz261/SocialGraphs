I will fight and I will die for freedom
Up against an eagle or a bear
I will help my brother and we'll sink or swim together
If you don't like it mister, I don't care

Cause I have served with honor in the army
I have been a soldier overseas
I have seen my fatherland stagger like a dying man
Blinded and bewildered by disease

And I ain't gonna take it any longer
I can't look around it anymore
I'll defend what I believe
In the land of liberty
Like my father did before

I'll just pray to god for Nicaragua
And the sorrow of El Salvador today
And I'll say until the day we free Mandela
All the world will be in chains

I will fight and I will die for freedom
Up against an eagle or a bear
I will help my brother and we'll sink or swim together
If you don't like it mister, I don't care

And I'll just pray to god for Nicaragua
And the sorrow of El Salvador today
And I'll say until the day we free Mandela
All the world will be in chains

 

Sandinista, you can hold your head up high
You have given back their Freedom
You have lived up to your name

Sandinista, may your spirit never die
Hold the candle to the darkness
You're the keeper of the flame

Sandinista, keep believing in the dream
The truth is stronger than the shadows
Keep it shining in your eyes

Sandinista, may the soldiers disappear
May your children live forever
May their laughter fill your lives

Sandinista, los fuerzas de la oscuridad
Nunca pueden extinguir la puridad de tu llama revolutionara
Con su terror y sus mentiras
Con su dinero y sys maquinas
La libertad en tus ojus
El amor caliente en tu corozon
Son fuerzas mas poderosas
Que las armas de la guerra

Sandinista, you can hold your head up high
You have given back their Freedom
You have lived up to your name

Sandinista, may your spirit never die
Hold the candle to the darkness
You're the keeper of the flame
