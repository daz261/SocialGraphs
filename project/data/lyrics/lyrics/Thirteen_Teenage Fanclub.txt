[Verse]
Goodbye, girl, where did you go?
Woke up this morning and I didn't know
We were together, but now we're not
Asked you for nothing, that's what I got

[Chorus]
It's okay, even better this way
That's what they'll tell you
That's what they'll say

[Verse]
Are we together? I guess we're not
Do you still want me? That's what I thought
Look in the mirror and I'm a mess
Open the window, forget about the rest

[Chorus]
It's okay, even better this way
That's what they'll tell you
That's what they'll say

[Chorus]
It's okay, even better this way
That's what they'll tell you
That's what they'll say
