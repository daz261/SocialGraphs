[Verse 1]
Don't be discouraged
Don't be dismayed
There's hope for all in this world
'Cause this is Christmas day

[Pre-Chorus]
Say a little prayer for the world
God teach us love
Though you think He doesn't hear
I know he does

[Chorus]
This is Christmas
Let the world sing
Let us all begin to heal
Hallejuah, this is Christmas
And with love we can begin today

[Verse 2]
Christmas bells ring
People's heart sing
I forget about all the troubles I seem to have
Tell myself to feel how my brother feels
Try to love'em and maybe then I could understand

[Pre-Chorus]
Make a little room in our hearts
No heart's to small
Can love each other today?
'Cause after all...

[Chorus]
This is Christmas
Let the world sing
Let us all begin to heal
Hallejuah, this is Christmas
And with love we can begin today

[Bridge]
Come, come, come see the little one
Come, come, come see the little one
Come see the baby
(Yeah yeah yeah yeah, ooh ooh ooh ooh, come...)
Come see the baby
(Yeah yeah yeah yeah, ooh ooh ooh ooh, you know, you know...)

[Chorus]
This is Christmas
Let the world sing
Let us all begin to heal
Hallejuah, this is Christmas
And with love we can begin today
This is Christmas
Let the world sing
Let us all begin to heal
Hallejuah, this is Christmas
And with love we can begin today
This is Christmas
Let the world sing
Let us all begin to heal
Hallejuah, this is Christmas
And with love we can begin today
This is Christmas
