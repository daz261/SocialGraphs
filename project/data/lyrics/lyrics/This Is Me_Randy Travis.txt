Must be doin' something wrong baby I don't know
But the gold fish are floating at the top of the bowl
And the dog he won't eat he just lays around
All night long he makes a lonesome sound
I know I had it coming
And its all my fault
But baby come back
Before you kill us all
The way the plants are dyin' you'd swear its fall
Looks just like autumn up and down the hall
And I talk to them baby like you supposed to do
But they're tired of hearing how I'm missin' you
And I know you told me
Not to call
But baby come back
Before you kill us all
Well its a desperate situation
I got a strong will to survive
But if this place is any indication
I may not make it out on time
Well its an eerie feeling in the still of the night
Knowin' that the cats down to three more lives
You've turned us all into nervous wrecks
We just sit around and wanderin' who's goin' to be next
And I know I had it coming
And its all my fault
But baby come back
Before you kill us all
Baby come back
Before you kill us all
Baby come back
Baby come back
Before you kill us all
Baby come back
Baby come back
Baby come back
