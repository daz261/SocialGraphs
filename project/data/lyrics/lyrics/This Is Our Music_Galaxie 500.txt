When you went blind
And I nearly lost my mind
It didn't last
'Cause you have another eyelid

And when you smile
Then you give yourself away
It's all too much
And you have another eyelid

But when you cry
Then I know we are in trouble
It's all too much
And you have another eyelid

 

Nighttime at the boulevard
And I'm walkin' home with you
The heat is just delicious
And you know just what to do

Mornin' is so perfect
But the noontime makes me tired
Walkin' in the park now
And I'm so glad that you were fired

Goin' to the movies
I found a shelter from the sun
Heard a gruesome story
About a couple on the run

 

[Verse 1]
Down to the clouds
Up from the roof
I missed the band
Why so aloof?

[Chorus]
Way up high and goin' too fast
Way up, way up high

[Verse 2]
Open your eyes
Come see my quilt
Big as the bed
Look what I built

[Chorus]
Way up high and goin' too fast
Way up, way up high
