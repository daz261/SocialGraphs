Wolves
Many miles they went
To reach this point
They went here to seek what they lost
What they lost before time
Before the first rays of light
In the worst torment of all

Despair
They dedicated their existence to follow
To explore
And how they searched

Eternity, darkness, the black
They ware only a piece
Of the complete puzzle

They the warriors they were
In a never ending maze of
Confusion

The life they so intensively hated
Wolves so many lifetimes they
Went to reach this point
And yet so many lifetimes to go

Eternity, darkness, the black
They ware only a piece of the
Complete puzzle
They - the warriors they were
In a never ending maze of confusion
