Gear are turning
In my head the sickness burning
Damning Eden
The purest of hearts are broken even

Ears are listening
The truth is sad a weak man's burden
Eyes are searching
The truth is sad it hides nothing

Touch my mind and fade away
Falling down... losing faith
You can't take my pain away
Falling down... Damning Eden

Hollowed sin
Dims the path of the righteous man
Hollowed man
From within comes the beggars hymn

(Chorus)
