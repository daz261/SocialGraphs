[Verse 1]
And I say, "Just go. Please, Dave, just drive
Get us as far as far can be
Get us away from tonight."
And I say, "Oh, I'm sorry, didn't mean to yell
I'm having a bad week
I miss my mom."

[Chorus]
We drive
Dave steps on the gas
The world that's flying by is slick and smooth
Big waves of light
The radio is playing Queen
We're rocking out

[Verse 2]
And we're going now
Cause, hey, this is it
This is where we are
Out here where silence is
Seventy miles an hour
Windows up tight
And I am home

[Chorus]
We drive
Dave steps on the gas
The world that's flying by is slick and smooth
Big waves of light
The radio is playing Queen
We're rocking out
[x3]

[Verse 3]
And I say, "Just go. Please, Dave, just drive
Get us as far as far can be
Get us away from tonight."
Seventy miles an hour
Windows up tight
And I am home

[Chorus]
We drive
Dave steps on the gas
The world that's flying by is slick and smooth
Big waves of light
The radio is playing Queen
We're rocking out
We're rocking out
We're rocking out
