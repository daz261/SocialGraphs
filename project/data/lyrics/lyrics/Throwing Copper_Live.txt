[Verse 1]
And to love, the God
And to fear, the flame
And to burn, the crowd that has a name

[Verse 2]
And to right or wrong
And to meek or strong
It is known, just scream it from the wall

[Pre-Chorus]
I've willed, I've walked
I've read, I've talked
I know, I know
I've been here before

[Chorus]
Hey, now we won't be raped
Hey, now we won't be scarred like that
Hey, now we won't be raped
Hey, now we won't be scarred like that

[Verse 3]
It's the sun that burns
It's the wheel that turns
It's the way we sing that makes 'em dream

[Verse 4]
And to Christ, a cross
And to me, a chair
I will sit and earn the ransom from up here

[Pre-Chorus]
I've willed, I've walked
I've read, I've talked
I know, I know
I've been here before

[Chorus]
Hey, now we won't be raped
Hey, now we won't be scarred like that
Hey, now we won't be raped
Hey, now we won't be scarred like that, scarred like that
(We won't, we won't, we won't, we won't)

[Verse 5]
And to love, a God
And to fear, a flame
And to burn, a love that has a name

[Pre-Chorus]
I've willed, I've walked
I've read, I've talked
I know, I know
I've been here before

[Chorus]
Hey, now we won't be raped
Hey, now we won't be scarred like that
Hey, now we won't be raped
Hey, now we won't be scarred like that, scarred like that

[Outro]
Hey, now, no, no
We won't be scarred like that
Wow we won't be scarred like that
