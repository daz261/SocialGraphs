Oh the dust has gathered on my windowsill
And the weeds in my garden are growing higher and higher still
And all I can do is sit and think about us
Two worlds colliding, I don’t ask too much
Do I ask too much

If you want to know why I’m here
Well I’ll tell you
You see I’m a fool for you
My nights were so long until you, you came along
Ease my pain that’s what you do
I’m a fool for you

I know I was acting a little crazy the other night
But sometimes I get so angry I don’t want to fight
And oh we rise up no one’s giving in
And not for all the tea in china will I lose your heart
Now you’re under my skin

If you want to know why I’m here
Well I’ll tell you
You see I’m a fool for you
My nights were so long until you, you came along
Ease my pain that’s what you do
I’m a fool for you

I once received a poem saying forever you’ll be
Now the writer of that poem I never ever see
So I don’t expect you to stop your whole world just for me
‘Cause people change we all move on
But I’m telling you oh so honestly

If you want to know why I’m here
Well I’ll tell you
You see I’m a fool for you
My nights were so long until you, you came along
Ease my pain that’s what you do
I’m a fool for you
