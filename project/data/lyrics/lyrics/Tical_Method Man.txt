[Intro: Method Man]
All the children come into the light...
(There will be...)

[Chorus: Left Eye and Method Man]
Rock-a-bye baby from the rooftop
When the guns blow, your cradle gets rocked
When the Earth quakes and the sky starts to fall
Down will come MCs, fake shit and all

[Verse 1: Method Man]
Off top it be the sure shot, the bomb drops
Aftershock blow your bumbaclot to smithereens
Time stop, flying guillotines coming for your slot
What you mean you spilled the beans, ock?
Blacked out and thought I seen Pac, laser beam Glock
What's a bird to a brother with a flock, what?
They got some nerve to even try to shit a turd
On John J, slap a nigga gay with the wordplay
Hot Nix shoot you with the gift, it's your birthday
God hatin' ugly in the worst way, fuck 'em like the Earth say
From first day I survey the hassle, death knockin' at your door
In the Big Apple, Meth' rotten to the core
Shackle in the sound castle
The dungeon with vermin in the form of MCs determined
To step foot on God's soil, not knowin' that
These eggheads come hard-boiled and heavy-handed
The aliens they just landed and you in the way
Overthrow these niggas' planet, Independence Day
Felons, get split melons, homicide
Bug niggas get the bug repellent, insecticide
Johnny 5 take it worldwide, as long as I
Pledge allegiance to the Dark Side, I'll never die
Who you know with a flow like this? Bring 'em in
What Clan you know blow like this? Bring 'em in
Take that nigga
(There will be...)

[Refrain: Method Man and Left Eye]
The sound of gun burst put the foul in the dirt
(Foul in the dirt)
You can't think clearly from the mind control theory
(Mind control theory)
Murder in the first bring 'em back down to Earth
(Back down to Earth)
Y'all niggas don't hear me prepare for the worst
(Prepare for the worst)

[Verse 2: Method Man]
Times gon' change, nothin' will remain the same
Million-dollar broke niggas still fucked up in the game
Make me wanna choke niggas shittin' on my name
Tuck your chain when I approach nigga, go against the grain now
Niggas stand in rain now, die hard fan
Call me John John McClain now, Snake vs. the Crane Style
Death to the enemy, Wu brother Number One
The Centipede, troublesome, send 'em all to Kingdom Come
Sun still shine one, time for your crooked mind
Drunk off a cheap wine, son I'm into street crime
Every word, every line, got juice very fine
Turn me loose on mankind, detonate the landmine
Focus my goal now, never sell, never sold
Live by the code now, never tell, never told
Darts I throw like Clyde with the finger roll
Clutch shots and whatnot, this is where the buck stops
Still can't eat and y'all still can't sleep
I elect myself as Presidential MC
Wu-Tang Killa Bee, the beehive facility
In love with the blunt smoke even though it's killing me
Bad vibes fillin' me with thoughts of conspiracy
White Water scandals with Bill Clinton Hillary
Too hot to handle, too well put together to dismantle
Fucker, you heard me
(There will be...)

[Refrain 2: Method Man]
Excuse me as I kiss the sky
Catch me when I fall son, I'm too young to die
Me and Lefty, that be the Eye come test me
If you don't know, you never know me
Booster, burn me

[Interlude: Booster]

[Chorus: Left Eye and Method Man]
Rock-a-bye baby from the rooftop
When the guns blow, your cradle gets rocked
When the Earth quakes and the sky starts to fall
Down will come MCs, fake shit and all

[Outro: Left Eye]
Ayo, I got three-hundred and sixty degrees of self
That's mind, body and spirit
A hundred and twenty degrees a piece
We gon' break it down into simple terms
That's nine nigga, nine, highest level of change
It's too many niggas sittin' on they ass
Waitin' for shit to just happen
Shit don't just happen, gon' fuck around a miss the boat
If you take away the negative, make room for the positive
That's addin' and subtractin' on the real
Niggas better learn they math
Cause if my calculations serve me correct
I'ma fuck around and have all this shit
I'm on your ass, nigga
