Well whoa oh
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

(Verse 1)
When I speak out loud
You say I'm crazy
When I'm feeling proud
You say I'm lazy
I look around and see the true reality

You like our hair
You love our music
Our culture's large, so you abuse it
Take time to understand, I'm an equal man

(Chorus)
History's a lie that they teach you in school
A fraudulent view called the golden rule
A peaceful land that was born civilized
Was robbed of its riches, its freedom, its pride


(Verse 2)
When I'm at work you say I'm great
You watch and ponder, but can you relate?
Inviting eyes hands drop, when the music stops

Don't ask me why I play this music
'Cause it's my culture, so naturally I use it
I state my claim to say, it's here for all to play

(Chorus)
History's a lie that they teach you in school
A fraudulent view called the golden rule
A peaceful land that was born civilized
Was robbed of its riches, its freedom, its pride

Yeah Yeah Yeah yeah

(Instrumental Break)

(Verse 3)
It's time for a change
Concepts rearrange
Now can't you feel my rage?

Well, It's up to you to seek the truth
To know your history, the difference between me and you
Relate to me as me, not what you see on TV

(Last Chorus)
History's a lie that they teach you in school
A fraudulent view called the golden rule
A peaceful land that was born civilized
Was robbed of its riches, its freedom, its pride

 

Yeah ehh ehh
Oh ooh ooh
Dib um dib dib dib dib dib dib

I always thought that our relationship was cool
You played the role of having sense, I always played the fool
Now something's different, I don't know the reason why
Whenever we separate, I almost want to cry

Oh no, please not that again
Love rears up its ugly head

And when I come home late, you don't complain or call
So as a consequence, I don't go out at all
My friends are frightened, they don't know what's going on
They think you put a spell on me and now my mind is gone

Oh no, please not that again
Love rears up its ugly head
Yeah, its ugly head

Love's not so bad they say
But you never know where love is gonna go
Does anybody really know?

Check this out

I'm standing at the altar as they play the wedding march
I'm in a black tuxedo with my collar full of starch
Oh, she looks as lovely as she's ever gonna get
I wake up from this nightmare in a pool of sweat

Oh no, no, no, no
Not that again, yeah

I'm not goin'
I'm not goin when
Love rears up its ugly head

No not me, no
No no, not me when
Love rears up its
Love rears up its ugly, ugly, ugly, ugly head

What you gonna do, Lord
What you gonna do when it comes and gets you?
Oh

 

Buy and die/or sell and be free
We are the new Jacks/this is our reality
Do unto others/leave no one alive
This is our creed/we will survive
No control is how I'm living
On the edge with no forgiving

Things get rough when you've got time to kill
You've got the cash/then I've got your thrill
I make more money than a judge or a cop
Give me a reason why I should stop

Large is how I'm living
On the edge with no forgiving

Some people say my soul is lost
I'll lose my life if I start to turn soft
From where I am there's no turning back
Crack is the master
I am a new Jack

Can anybody see me?
Can anybody hear me?

I'll never change/I'll never stop
I've got cold cash/I'm on the top
We can get busy if you want to play
I'll have the last laugh when I blow you away

Don't you see me?
Can't you hear me?
