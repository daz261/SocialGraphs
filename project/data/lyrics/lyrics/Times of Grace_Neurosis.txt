To burrow my way through death and flesh
All beasts I let out, ill buried untold
To lock my cage, unleash the fallen
Fear eyes contain light in my soul

Feral snakes collide burn in my skull
Freeing the circles that night I saw a burial train
All thieves I bludgeon, from ice I burn, breathe astral plane

Greyed eye enclosed
Seer east is gone
From now on, farther on

I'm nailed to the crossroads
Searching for the piece of me that wasn't mine
Blood dripping from my hands
My mind has seen the figure of my lightkeeper
Standing in the doorway
