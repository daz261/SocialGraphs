To all those people doing lines
Don't do it, don't do it
Inject your soul with liberty
It's free, it's free

To all the kids with heroin eyes
Don't do it, don't do it
Because it's not, not what it seems
No, no it's not, not what it seems

Salvation, salvation, salvation is free
Salvation, salvation, salvation is free

Do do do do do do do do
Do do do doooo
Do do do do do do do do
Do do do doooo

To all those parents with sleepless nights
Sleepless nights
Tie your kids home to their beds
Clean their heads

To all the kids with heroin eyes
Don't do it, don't do it
Because it's not, not what it seems
No, no it's not, not what it seems

Salvation, salvation, salvation is free
Salvation, salvation, salvation is free

Salvation, salvation, salvation is free
Salvation, salvation, salvation is free
