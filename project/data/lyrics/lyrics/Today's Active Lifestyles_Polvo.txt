First time it crossed my mind
That second thoughts were my design
I'm not's faking up to baking
Me a sign

You break free in time to see
Kill our treasure versus me
To a soldier smarter, older
Things have seem to gotten bolder
By design

Freeman’s grip won’t make this tip
Won’t make what’s better starts to slip
You are silent, self-reliant
Try so hard to be defiant
By design

And in time we could climb out
From this hideout when the curve is known
Even though we’ve tried to draw the shadows
On the ground below

And you watch it
A lazy comet lazy comet
You can’t stop it
It’s a lazy comet lazy comet
