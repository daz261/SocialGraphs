Woke up this morning
I had a laugh
Saw you lying there
I had to laugh
Last night come clear
I had to laugh
Listening to the rain
I had to laugh

So I talked to the devil
Yeah, I had to laugh
I talked to God
Who just sat and laughed
Those boys are funny
Oh, they make me laugh
So damn funny
I nearly pissed my pants

There's no way out
I have to laugh
There ain't no way back
I have to laugh
The rain comes down harder
I have to laugh
It's getting darker
I have to laugh

Another day finished
Another day done
I'm right here next to you
Hoping tomorrow will come
I'm here right next to you
Hoping tomorrow will come
Hoping tomorrow will come

I have to laugh
I have to laugh
I have to laugh
I have to laugh
I have to laugh
I have to laugh
I have to laugh
