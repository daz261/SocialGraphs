[Verse 1]
Are you the future or are you the past?
Have you been chosen or are you the last?
The message was sent, it seems so unreal
'Cause now I'm made of plastic, wire and steel
And steel

[Pre-Chorus]
Follow for now and follow for this
'Cause everybody follows for nothing at all
Follow for now and follow for this
'Cause everybody follows for nothing at all
Because

[Chorus]
Supernova, yeah, supernova
Supernova goes pop
Supernova, you think it's over, but
The supernova don't stop

[Verse 2]
Can you explain just what you are?
'Cause I've never been this close to a star, alright
The message was sent, you know what to do
'Cause everybody needs to be someone, don't you?
Right, don't you?

[Pre-Chorus]
Follow for now and follow for this
'Cause everybody follows for nothing at all
Follow for now and follow for this
'Cause everybody follows for nothing at all
Because

[Chorus]
Supernova, yeah, supernova
Supernova goes pop
Supernova, you think it's over, but
The supernova don't stop

[Chorus]
Supernova, yeah, supernova
Supernova goes pop
Supernova, you think it's over, but
The supernova don't stop

[Outro]
Let's go
Supernova, yeah, supernova
That supernova goes pop
Supernova, supernova
That supernova don't stop
Supernova, supernova
That supernova goes pop, alright
Supernova, supernova
Supernova don't, it don't, it don't
Stop

 

[Intro]
Now this is what it's like when worlds collide
Now this is what it's like
Now this is what it's like when worlds collide
Now this is what it's like

[Verse 1]
What is it really that's goin' on here?
You've got the system for total control
Now is there anybody out there?
Now watch us suffer, yeah, 'cause we can't go
What is it really that is in your head?
What little life that you had just died
I'm gonna be the one that's takin' over
Now this is what it's like when worlds collide

[Chorus]
Are you ready to go?
Cause I'm ready to go
What you gonna do, baby, baby?
Are you goin' with me?
Cause I'm goin' with you
That's the end of all time

[Verse 2]
What is it really that motivates you?
The need to fly or this fierce stop?
I'll go along, but then you'll realize
When we get there, I say nine of ten drop
Now who's the light and who is the Devil?
You can't decide, so I'll be your guide
And one by one, they will be hand-chosen
Now this is what it's like when worlds collide

[Chorus]
Are you ready to go?
Cause I'm ready to go
What you gonna do, baby, baby?
Are you goin' with me?
Cause I'm goin' with you
That's the end of all time

[Bridge]
(You are a robot)
Now this is what it's like when worlds collide
Now this is what it's like
Now this is what it's like when worlds collide
Now this is what it's like

[Verse 3]
What is it really when they're fallin' over?
Everything that you thought was denied
I'm gonna be the one that's takin' over
Now this is what it's like when worlds collide

[Chorus]
Are you ready to go?
Cause I'm ready to go
What you gonna do, baby, baby?
Are you goin' with me?
Cause I'm goin' with you
That's the end of all time
Are you ready to go?
Cause I'm ready to go
What you gonna do, baby, baby?
Are you goin' with me?
Cause I'm goin' with you
That's the end of all time

[Outro]
Are you ready?
Yeah, I'm ready
That's the end of all time
Are you goin'?
Yeah I'm goin'
That's the end of all time
