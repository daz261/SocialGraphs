The urge... so strong
To do the devil's work
The flock of jesus christ
I will rape your souls
'till you see the devil clear

Blackwinged

Evil wings bring torture from the skies
With a limb so huge
To serve you christian sluts
Penetrate your pure cunts with might
Now you filthy cunts, do you see the moon?
It's glowing for the black wings return

Blackwinged

We'll burn your worthless bodies
And send the fire and stench
To heaven high, Remind your worthless
God, that our victory is complete
Clean this earth of holy bitches
Desecrate mother mary

Blackwinged

 

Brothers of north, brothers of doom
Ravens has spoke, the attack must begin

The shadows of our warrior souls
Will float with infernal speed

Souls of christ, prepare for fight
We'll crush your halls with bonecrushing
Might supreme

Your feeble cries will not be heard
Since your god lies dead and buried
In the ruins of the pearly gates

Brothers of north, brothers of doom

Endlessnights of total war
Coming closer
Gather, hell is calling... gather
Gather for attack on the pearly gates
