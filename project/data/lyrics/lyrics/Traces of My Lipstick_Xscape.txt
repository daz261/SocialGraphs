[Verse 1 - LaTocha:]
It's a glowing little feeling
Like a summer sun that slowly rises
On a new horizon of love
And it's more exotic than Jamaica
Or the rain that falls in Costa Rica
Like a waterfall to the sea
So tell me, baby

[Pre-Chorus (LaTocha):]
Do you wanna fly
I can take you high
Come ride over these midnight skies
(Come ride with me, come lay with me)
If you're looking for heaven's only door
You got the key
Baby, open me
(Baby)

[Chorus:]
Baby won't you come inside
I'll take you on a fantasy ride
(I'll take you, boy, I'll take you, baby)
Take a journey through my universe
(Through my universe)
My love's the softest place on Earth
You dont have to pull the blinds
(No, no)
Let the neighbors lose their minds
Baby, you can be the first
Inside the softest place on Earth

[Verse 2 - LaTocha:]
Overflowing with emotion
I will make you feel so sensual
When I touch you
You'll lose all control
So come on baby
Kiss me all over
From my mountains to my valley low
There's an ocean of love
Just for you (just for you)

[Repeat Pre-Chorus w\ad-libs:]
Do you wanna fly
I can take you high
Come ride over these midnight skies
If you're looking for heaven's only door
You got the key
Baby, open me

[Repeat Chorus w\LaTocha ad-libs:]
Baby won't you come inside
I'll take you on a fantasy ride
(I'll take you, boy, I'll take you, baby)
Take a journey through my universe
(Through my universe)
My love's the softest place on Earth
You dont have to pull the blinds
(No, no)
Let the neighbors lose their minds
Baby, you can be the first
Inside the softest place on Earth

[Bridge - Tiny & LaTocha]
So no more dreaming
(So no more dreaming)
My body's steaming
(Your body's steaming)
You want it, baby
This is your night
(This is your night, baby)
I keep on rising and fantasizing
I want you it bad
I'll do what you like
(Do what you like, boy, yeah)
We can do it in the movies
Or in my jacuzzi
Or maybe Central Park if you like
(It's all right with me, baby)
So if there's any doubt
This is what I'm all about
So tell you friends
I'm turning  you out

[Repeat Chorus w\ad-libs:]
Baby won't you come inside
I'll take you on a fantasy ride
(I'll take you, boy, I'll take you, baby)
Take a journey through my universe
(Through my universe)
My love's the softest place on Earth

You dont have to pull the blinds
(No, no)
Let the neighbors lose their minds
Baby, you can be the first
Inside the softest place on Earth
Baby won't you come inside
I'll take you on a fantasy ride
(I'll take you, boy, I'll take you, baby)
Take a journey through my universe
(Through my universe)
My love's the softest place on Earth
