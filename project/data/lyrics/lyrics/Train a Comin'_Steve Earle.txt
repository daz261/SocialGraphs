[Verse]
If you see her out tonight
And she tells you it's just the lights
That bring her here and not her loneliness
That's what she says, but sometimes she forgets

[Verse]
If she tells you she don't need a man
She's had all the comfort she can stand
You'd best believe every word she say
But don't give up 'cause sometimes she forgets

[Chorus]
Sometimes she forgets
That not too long ago she swore
She wasn't gonna let her heart
Been broken anymore

[Verse]
So now she keeps it locked away
And it grows colder every day
And it won't warm to any man's caress
That's what she says, but sometimes she forgets

[Chorus]
Sometimes she forgets
That not too long ago she swore
She wasn't gonna let her heart
Been broken anymore

[Verse]
So if you see her out tonight
And she tells you it's just the lights
That bring her here and not her loneliness
That's what she says, but sometimes she forgets

[Outro]
Hey now, don't give up 'cause sometimes she forgets
