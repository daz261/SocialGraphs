Did someone call my name?
Like a distant drum is beating
Or is it just another dream of long ago?
I dance again I am spinning
In the light I am living
And I can feel the power rushing through my veins
Once upon a time I could do no wrong
For the candle flickers, the flame is never gone

To my brilliant feat
They all pay heed
I hear the crowds roar oh so loudly

Is it a game of chance?
Or merely circumstances
A jack to a king and back
Then you have to pay to play
The world it won't wait for you
Its got its own things to do
The sun's gotta rise and drive another night away
And as I listen to the silence
I can hear thunder in the distance

To my brilliant feat
They all pay heed
I hear the crowds roar oh so loudly

To my brilliant feat
I make grown men weep
And still my eyes grow oh so cloudy
