Whoa-oh prisoner, my pretty
Whoa-oh prisoner

A black ocean is the sky above
Tiny lights bob, what star you from
Trapped in material plane
She wants to fly and they think she’s insane, but
She knows what she know
Give that girl wings and that’s all that she wrote

Twilight zone, twilight zone
I’m floating in the dark alone and
Is there any love out here, let me know

A laser light pinpoints the top of my dome
Then through my body as if Scotty’s
Beaming up a wayward soul
Mutant races in an ancient universe
Dark shadows, humans rhymin’ in a reggae verse

It’s gone if you blink
I can see it as soon as you think it

Good calls, crystal balls on sidewalk malls
Psychic people outdoors readin’ palms

I believe that you know more
To survive the dimension is four

Whoa-oh prisoner, my pretty
Whoa-oh prisoner

Look at the way she’s searching
Trapped in a world that’s hurting
So bad it makes her cry
But I won’t let her say goodbye

Twilight zone, twilight zone
I’m floating in the dark alone and
Is there any love out here let me know

Twilight zone, twilight zone
I’m floating in the dark alone and
Is there any love out here let me know
