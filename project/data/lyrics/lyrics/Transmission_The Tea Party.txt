You wanted this
So sad to see
The sweet decay
Of ecstasy

And you want it all
And you want it all

A frozen sun
Would guide you there
As shadows hide
Their deep despair

And you want it all
And you want it all

I'll give you something more
And you'll fade away
One last kiss before
You fade away

So sleep tonight
In idle dreams
The pain will drown
Your silent screams

And you want it all
And you want it all

I'll give you something more
And you'll fade away
One last kiss before
You fade away

Lives you once adored
Will fade away
Lies you can't ignore
You soon repay

As you fade away
As you fade away
As you fade away
As you fade away
And you'll fade away
