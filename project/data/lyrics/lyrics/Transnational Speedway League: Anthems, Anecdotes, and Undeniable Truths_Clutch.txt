Perhaps it's just the way the light falls
But everything looks like a target to me
And I don't know where the gun is
But I'm certain that it's pointed at me

And in the jungle, retched jungle
They say the lion eats tonight
And all around it is a coliseum
Dripping with a voracious appetite

I say hey there, fella
Whose soul are you tormenting now?
Hey there, fella
Whose soul are you tormenting now?

In the course of all the previous events
It is evident that something's bound to happen
Come on, rear your ugly head to me
I've got nothing to lose but my apathy

The root of the problem has been isolated
The root of the problem has been isolated
The root of the problem has been isolated
The root of the problem has been isolated

Come on, motherfucker
Come on, motherfucker
Come on, motherfucker
Let's throw down

Come on, motherfucker
Come on, motherfucker
Come on, motherfucker
Let's throw down

Just try me
Just try me
What are you waiting for?

Come on, motherfucker
Let's throw down
Come on, motherfucker
Let's go

Just rear your ugly fucking head
I'll put it on a platter
Just rear your ugly fucking head
I'll put it on a platter

Come on, motherfucker
Come on, motherfucker
Come on, motherfucker
Let's throw down

Come on, motherfucker
Come on, motherfucker
Come on, motherfucker
Let's go

Hey there
Hey fella
Hey there
Hey fella

Come on, motherfucker
Come on, motherfucker
Come on, motherfucker
Let's throw down

Come on, motherfucker
Come on, motherfucker
Come on, motherfucker
Let's throw down

Just try me
Just try me
What are you waiting for?

Come on, motherfucker
Let's throw down
Come on, motherfucker
Let's go

I'll make you wish that you'd never been born
I'll make you wish that you'd never been born
I'll make you wish that you'd never been born
Come on, motherfucker
Let's go

Hey there
Hey fella
Hey there
Hey fella
