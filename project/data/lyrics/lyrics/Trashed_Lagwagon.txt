[Verse 1]
Look at the world in disbelief
You used to follow; now you lead
College has enlightened you
And you are proud to be different
And like different bands, different types
You ain't nobody's fool

[Bridge 1]
It's like certain bands remind you of someone you hated
Cause they didn't wear the right clothing
And there's only one true fashion
And a lot of the bands on the college charts are great bands
Until they get signed; then you hate them
It's such bullshit
You used to love them, you hypocrite!

[Chorus]
Know it all
Know it all
Did you really listen to that song?
Could you ever write what you call wrong?

[Verse 2]
I remember you and I
Listening to bands that we liked
Only the songs mattered to you
But now you're a DJ and preaching that hype
"Corporate rock sucks," you know
"College radio enlightens you."

[Bridge 2]
It's supposed to serve as a means to expose new bands without prejudice
But it makes no sense
"Safe Harbor for the Underground"
'Til the alternative becomes the popular sound
The bands are good 'til they make enough cash to eat food
And get a pad
Then "they sold out" and "their music's cliche,"
Because talent's exclusive to bands without pay!

[Chorus]
Know it all
Know it all
Did you really listen to that song?
Could you ever write what you call wrong?
Know it all!
