Ivory Tusk, smash into thine own
To show thee fit to continue
I weep for them and I weep for me
We rally to charge to die
And laugh when it's through

Well rise and walk now you're a man
Don't try to play catch me if you can
Just do as you're told son you must abide
Have you gone crazy it never was a free ride
Just take yo medicine and help it go down
Do as you're told boy no need to frown
You know it happened to me and your granddad too
Not a goddamn any one can do

Well sir I don't know but I hear them say
If there's no free ride then ride away
And it could be me, and it could be strange
But keep hearing voices singing "comes a change"

Blood drop spill unto the parched earth
And nourish that which is hungry
Feast well avenging madness
Then call your buzzards down to clean the carcass

Well your life's not yours it's everyone's
So do the right thing and go for your guns
It's how the world was saved and how the west was won
So here he comes now you gotta stand or run
Just level your iron boy and sight him in
You ain't out to die boy
You're out to win
You know you hate him, you must know he hates you
Not a goddamn anyone can do

Well if my life is everyone's well good that's fine
But you've yet to prove that that makes his life mine
And it could be me and I could be strange
But I keep hearing voices singing "comes a change"

Like rain and thunder washing everything away
That's what I hear them say
You might just prefer to pray
It's the same thing anyway

Ivory Tusk, smash into thine own
To show thee fit to continue
I weep for them and I weep for me
We rally to charge to die
And laugh when it's through

Well sir I don't know but I hear them say
If there is no free ride then ride away
And it could be me, and it could be strange
But keep hearing voices singing "comes a change"

Like rain and thunder washing everything away
That's what I hear them say
You might just prefer to pray
Like rain and thunder washing everything away
That's what I hear them say
You might just prefer to pray
