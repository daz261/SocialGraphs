[Verse 1]
You've got troubles on your mind
Keeps you away from me, there's no sense in denying
And I've cursed myself for the longest time
And now I find I just don't mind

[Verse 2]
Leave your coat beside the door
Come and lay here on this blanket on the floor
And we'll throw our candles in the flames tonight
Set it right, try to set it right

[Chorus]
When all our tears coming down are gone
And I shed my skin before this evening's done
If we never get the chance to come back here again
I'll understand, you know I'll understand
You know I'll understand

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
All the spirits of the night
Watch us sleeping here beside the firelight
And I'll hold my tongue 'til this moment's gone
Kiss the dawn, stay to kiss the dawn

[Chorus]
When all our tears coming down are gone
And I shed my skin before this evening's done
If we never get the chance to come back here again
I'll understand, you know I'll understand
You know I'll understand
