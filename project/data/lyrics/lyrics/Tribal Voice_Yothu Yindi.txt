Well I heard it on the radio
And I saw it on the television
Back in 1988, all those talking politicians

Words are easy, words are cheap
Much cheaper than our priceless land
But promises can disappear
Just like writing in the sand

Treaty yeah treaty now treaty yeah treaty now

Nhima djatpangarri nhima walangwalang
Nhe djatpayatpa nhima gaya' nhe marrtjini yakarray
Nhe djatpa nhe walang gumurrt jararrk gutjuk

This land was never given up
This land was never bought and sold
The planting of the union jack
Never changed our law at all
Now two river run their course
Seperated for so long
I’m dreaming of a brighter day
When the waters will be one

Treaty yeah treaty now treaty yeah treaty now

Nhima gayakaya nhe gaya' nhe
Nhe gaya' nhe marrtjini walangwalang nhe ya
Nhima djatpa nhe walang
Gumurr-djararrk yawirriny'
Nhe gaya' nhe marrtjini gaya' nhe marrtjini
Gayakaya nhe gaya' nhe marrtjini walangwalang
Nhima djatpa nhe walang
Gumurr-djararrk nhe yå, e i, e i, e i i i, i i i, i i i, i i

Treaty ma'

Promises disappear - priceless land - destiny
Well i heard it on the radio
And i saw it on the television
But promises can be broken
Just like writing in the sand

Treaty yeah treaty now treaty yeah treaty now
Treaty yeah treaty now treaty yeah treaty now
Treaty yeah treaty ma treaty yeah treaty ma
Treaty yeah treaty ma treaty yeah treaty ma

Look at the sun
Falling from the sky
And the sunset\Takes my mind
Back to my homeland
Far away

It's a story
Planted in my mind
It's so clear
I remember
Oh my
Oh my sunset dreaming

Wo Djapana

Hey you people
Out there
How come you ain't fair
To the people of the land?
Try my
Try my sunset dreaming

Hey you children
Of the land
Don't be fooled
By the Balanda ways

It will cause
Sorrow and woe
For our people
And our land

Wo Djapana
Wo warwu
Wo rramani
Wo galanggarri

So live it up
Live it up
Live it up
Live it up
Live it up
With sunset dreaming
