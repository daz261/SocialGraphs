[Intro]

[Verse 1]
God is pressure
God is pressure more or less
It takes a lifetime
A life of lies to make a mess
Ah, but you suffer
I see you suffer with a smile
Well, look around yourself
Baby, don't you think you're in denial

[Pre-Chorus]
And it hurts so bad
To see your garden of debris
Don't make a move now
Could be the thing that sets you free

[Chorus 1]
Just say you didn't mean it
All you say now is a great big lie
Just say you didn't mean it
It's a great big lie

[Verse 2]
You pulled the plug
You pulled the plug to save your face
I'd be the first
To re-conciliate the grace
Ah, but you suffer
I see you suffer with a smile
Well, look around yourself
Baby, don't you think you're in denial

[Chorus 1]
Just say you didn't mean it
All you say now is a great big lie
Just say you didn't mean it
It's a great big lie

[Chorus 2]
Just say you didn't mean it
And you still deny
Just say you didn't mean it
It's a great big lie

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus 1]
Just say you didn't mean it
All you say now is a great big lie
Just say you didn't mean it
It's a great big lie

[Chorus 2]
Just say you didn't mean it
And you still deny
Just say you didn't mean it
It's a great big lie

Just say you didn't mean it
