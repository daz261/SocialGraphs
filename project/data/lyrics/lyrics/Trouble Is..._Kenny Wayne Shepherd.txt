Now where do you go after midnight
When all the doors should be closed?
Your alibis just don't sound right
And I ask but nobody knows

When you look me in the eye
And make it sound so very nice
With your true lies

Hey someone's been sleeping in my bed
Cause this room don't smell like you and me
Someone's been sneaking out the window
Do you think I'm too blind to see?

When you look me in the eye
And make it sound so very nice
With your true lies
It was a clever disguise
But girl I'm getting wise to your true lies

Well you've been doing this so long now
Thinking it's the truth
I guess it don't seem wrong
If it ain't being done to you
You got a lot to learn, babe
You can't keep it down
When the word gets in the wind
Then it's bound to come back around

Girl can you give me a reason
I bet you don't even know why
Cause I can't figure out what you're thinking
Or what it is you're trying to justify

Hey when you look me in the eye
And make it sound so very nice
With your true lies
It was a clever disguise
But girl I'm getting wise to your true lies
Yeah you can laugh you can cry but girl
I just can't buy your true true lies

 

[Verse 1]
Night... falls and I'm alone
Skin... yeah, chilled me to the bone
You... turned and you ran, oh yeah
Oh, slipped... right from my hand

[Chorus]
Hey, blue on black, tears on a river
Push on a shove, it don't mean much
Joker on jack, match on a fire
Cold on ice, it's a dead man's touch
Whisper on a scream
Doesn't change a thing
Don't bring you back
Blue on black, oh yeah, blue on black

[Verse 2]
Blind... oh, now I see
Truth... lies, and in between
Wrong... can't be undone
Oh, slipped... from the tip of your tongue

[Chorus]
Hey, blue on black, tears on a river
Push on a shove, it don't mean much
Joker on jack, match on a fire
Cold on ice, it's a dead man's touch
Whisper on a scream
Doesn't change a thing
Doesn't bring you back, yeah
Blue on black, oh blue on black, oh yeah

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Blue on black, tears on a river
Push on a shove, it don't mean much
Joker on jack, match on a fire
Cold on ice, it's a dead man's touch
Whisper on a scream
Doesn't change a thing
Don't bring you back
Blue on black, oh yeah, blue on black

[Chorus]
Hey, blue on black, tears on a river
Push on a shove, it don't mean much
Joker on jack, match on a fire
And cold on ice, it's a dead man's touch
Whisper on a scream
Doesn't change a thing
Doesn't bring you back
Blue on black, oh, blue on black

[Outro]
Oh blue on black, oh blue on black
