Well, you're running to the microchips
And you're falling on your feet
And you're running to the West side
And you're trying to be discreet
And you're falling for the hip line
And you're busting out of here
And you're hanging with the sublime
And you're living out your fears, yeah

(Hang on)
But you hang on tight
(And you're running around
With your face in the ground)
Like love at first sight
(Hang on)
But you hang on tight
(And you're running around
With your face in the ground)
Like it was your last night
Your last night

And you're dancing on the windowsills
And you're popping things that count
And you never felt a real slide
No significant account
And you're going around at warp speed
And you're fishing for a break
And you're living on the East side
And you never feel sedate

And you're living in a dream world
And you're jumping on the roof
And when you're crawling down the hallway
You're still trying to act aloof
But somewhere in your dark side
Everything's fucked
It seeps into your vision
Of being thunderstruck, yeah

(Hang on)
And you hang on tight
(And you're running around
With your face in the ground)
Like love at first sight
(Hang on)
And you hang on tight
(And you're running around
With your face in the ground)
Like it was your last night

(Hang on tight)
(And you're running around
With your face in the ground)
(Hang on tight)
You hang on tight
(And you're running around
With your face in the ground)
(Hang on)
Like it was your last night

(Hang on)
Well, you hang on tight
(And you're running around
With your face in the ground)
Like love at first sight
(Hang on)
Yeah, you hang on tight
(And you're running around
With your face in the ground)
Like it was your last right

(Hang on)
Like it was your last right
(Hang on)
(Hang on)

 

If you need to follow, if you need a push
If you need to swallow behind the bush
If you want to get out, if you want it in
If you need to throw out discipline

Take out all the odds and ends
Know the way to better friends

'Cause it's the right time for a change
And you're tired of waiting
When things are getting really strange
And it's the right time for a change
And you're tired of waiting
When you start to feel restrained

And if you need to bail out, if you're in a spin
If you want to bail out on the rim
If you need to feel the electric lie
If you want to know the warning signs

Take out all the odds and ends
And know the way to better friends

'Cause it's the right time for a change
And you're tired of waiting
When things are getting really strange
And it's the right time for a change
And you're tired of waiting
When you start to feel restrained

Crashland consequence
Dance band hypertense
Head bang on the fence
Backhand self-defense

'Cause it's the right time for a change
And you're tired of waiting
When things are getting really strange
And it's the right time for a change
And you're tired of waiting
When you start to feel restrained

Ah, it's the right time for a change
(And you're tired of waiting)
It's the right time for a change
And it's the right time for a change
(And you're tired of waiting)
When you start to feel restrained, restrained
