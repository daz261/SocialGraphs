[Chorus: Teddy Pendergrass & Lisa Fischer]
You can do it, anything you want
You can do it if you try
You can make the world a better place
Don't try to hide
You can have it any way you want
Take your time to decide
Now I've got a reason
I'm so glad

[Verse 1: Teddy Pendergrass & Lisa Fischer]
So you're feelin' down
Got no one around, oh no
Wish you had that someone (To make you feel)
Every day you're glad to be alive

World just keeps on turnin'
Spinnin' 'round and 'round all the time
If you have a dream (Like Dr. King)
Don't let 'em drag you down, no

[Chorus: Teddy & Lisa]
You can do it, anything you want
You can do it if you try
You can make the world a better place
Don't try to hide (No)
You can have it any way you want
Take your time to decide
Now I've got a reason
I'm glad to be alive

[Verse 2: Teddy, Lisa, Both]
One boy meets a girl (Woo, woo, uh)
Then they fall in love (The story goes)
They can change the world (Every day)
Everybody's glad to be alive
What's the use in tryin', oh
Look at all the people (With no brain)
Ain't no use in cryin', no (Ain't no way)
You can find a way, oh

[Chorus: Teddy & Lisa]
You can do it, anything you want (Oh)
You can do it if you try (Oh, yeah)
You can make the world a better place (Make it better)
Don't try to hide (Yes, you can)
You can have it any way you want
Take your time to decide
Now I've got a reason
I'm glad to be alive (Glad to be alive)
You can do it, anything you want
You can do it if you try (If you try)
You can make the world a better place
Don't try to hide
You can have it any way you want (Any way)
Take your time to decide (Ooh)
Now I've got a reason
I'm glad to be alive (Glad to be alive)

[Bridge: Teddy & Lisa]
Oh, oh, yeah (Oh, oh)
Shout about it, yeah
Shout about it, ooh
So glad to be alive
(Oh, oh) Oh, oh
Just to hear you sing this song
Yes, I'm glad to be alive
So glad to be alive
Oh, yes, I'm glad to be alive
So glad, a reason

[Chorus: Teddy & Lisa]
You can do it (Yeah), anything you want (Oh, oh)
You can do it if you try
You can make the world a better place
Don't try to hide (Don't try)
You can have it any way you want
Take your time to decide
Now I've got a reason
I'm glad to be alive

[Outro: Teddy & Lisa]
Yes, I'm glad (Ooh) to be alive
(So glad) So glad (Shout it out, yeah)
Oh, yes, I'm glad (Oh) to be alive
Now I've got a reason
I'm glad to be alive
Yes, I'm glad to be alive
So glad
Oh yes, I'm glad to be alive
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yes, I'm glad to be alive
So glad
