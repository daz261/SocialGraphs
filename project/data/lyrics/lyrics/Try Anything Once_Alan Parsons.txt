It's no good believing in somebody else
If you can't believe in yourself
You give them the reason
To take all the power and wealth
It's no good you trying to sit on the fence
And hope that the trouble will pass
'Cause sitting on fences
Can make you a pain in the ass

If there's something you find to believe in
Then the message must get through
So don't just sit in silence
When you know what to do

Turn it up
Turn it up, make it louder
Turn it up
Turn it up, make it louder

There's no conversation if nobody speaks
And nothing gets done in the end
There's no confrontation
When fantasy makes you its friend
So much injustice, too many lies
We don't have to look very far
But nothing will change if we leave things
The way that they are

If there's something you find to believe in
Then the message must get through
So don't just sit in silence
When you know what to do

Turn it up
Turn it up, make it louder
Turn it up
Turn it up, make it louder

 

You can take me up, you can wind me down
There's no escape, but I'll never drown
No wires or strings, no rough and smooth
Just fire and stings, watch me closely, watch my every move

I can count your money while I check your hand
And you know I just can't lose

Wine from the water, gold from a tree
I wouldn't fool you, there's nothing up my sleeve
Look for a mirror, there's nothing there
I get rings out of nowhere, money from thin air

I can break these chains, while i'm upside down
Well it may seem strange, I don't hit the ground
Now you see my hand, is quicker than your eye
You should know by now, what you see here, all of it's a lie

I can count your money while I check your hand
And you know I just can't lose

Wine from the water, gold from a tree
I wouldn't fool you, there's nothing up my sleeve
Think of a number, I'll get it right
Throw me in the river, tie my hands up tight

I can wind you up, I can turn you round
No cunning stunts, till the lady's found
No coils or springs, just nice and smooth
No knaves or kings, find the lady, watch my every move

I can count your money while I check your hand
And you know I just can't lose

Wine from the water, gold from a tree
I wouldn't fool you, there's nothing up my sleeve
Look for a mirror, no, nothing there
I get rings out of nowhere, money from thin air

Wine from the water, gold from a tree
Now I wouldn't fool you, there's nothing up my sleeve
Think of a number, I'll get it right
You can throw me in the river, tie my hands up tight

Wine from the water, gold from a tree
Now i wouldn't fool you, there's nothing up my sleeve
Look for a mirror, there's nothing there
I get rings out of nowhere, money from thin air
