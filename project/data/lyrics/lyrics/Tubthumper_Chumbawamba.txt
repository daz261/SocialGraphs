[Verse 1]
Goodbye to the summer
Sold down the river
Unhappy ever after
Well, did you ever?

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Did you ever reach for the glued-down penny?
Same old joke and it's not funny
Burns are red, bruises blue
Out with the old, cheated by the new

[Chorus]
Do you suffer from long-term memory loss?
(I don't remember)
Do you suffer from long-term memory loss?
(I don't remember)

[Verse 2]
You sing the same old verse
Stick like glue, for better or worse
What goes around comes around
Again, again, again

[Pre-Chorus 2]
This heart, pulled apart
Hydra fighting, head-to-head
Burns are red, bruises blue
Out with the old, cheated by the new

[Chorus]
Do you suffer from long-term memory loss?
(I don't remember)
Do you suffer from long-term memory loss?
(I don't remember)

[Bridge]
(Ooh-ooh)
Amnesia
(Ooh-ooh)

[Chorus]
Do you suffer from long-term memory loss?
(I don't remember)
Do you suffer from long-term memory loss?
(I don't remember)

[Outro 1]
Do you suffer from long-term memory loss?
(I don't remember)
Do you suffer from long-term memory loss?
(I don't remember)

[Outro 2/Interlude]
(Cut the head in half using a bandsaw)
(And scoop the brains out)
(Blast the brain out with water or air)
(Suck the brain out through a hole in the head)
(What about free speech?)
(What about free speech?)
(What about free speech?)
(Look, that's not the point)
(You're giving this place a bad name)
(I've got my position to think of)
