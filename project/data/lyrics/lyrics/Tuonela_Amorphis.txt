[Verse 1]
You live only for yourself
Or send your soul to the heaven's grace
Been weak as the autumn leaves
Or as strong as the growing seed

[Pre-Chorus]
Swallowed into the black
Search for the entrance

[Chorus]
Watch to the eyes of morning star
Beckon for the savior
But it's much too far
Reach for the infinity
The only thing that remains is decay

[Chorus]
Watch to the eyes of morning star
Beckon for the savior
But it's much too far
Reach for the infinity
The only thing that remains
The only thing that remains
