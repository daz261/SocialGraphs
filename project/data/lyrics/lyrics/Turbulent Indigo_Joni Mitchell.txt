[Verse 1]
I pulled up behind a Cadillac
We were waiting for the light
I took a look at his license plate
It said 'Just Ice'
Is justice just ice?
Governed by greed and lust
Just the strong doing what they can
And the weak suffering what they must

[Chorus]
Oh, and the gas leaks
And the oil spills
And sex sells everything
Sex kills
Oh, sex kills

[Verse 2]
Doctors' pills give you brand new ills
And the bills bury you like an avalanche
And lawyers haven't been this popular
Since Robespierre slaughtered half of France
And Indian chiefs with their old beliefs
Know the balance is undone, crazy ions
You can feel it out in traffic
Everyone hates everyone

[Chorus]
And the gas leaks
And the oil spills
And sex sells everything
Sex kills
Oh, sex kills

[Verse 3]
All these jack-offs at the office
The rapist in the pool
Oh, and the tragedies in the nurseries
Little kids packing guns to school
The ulcerated ozone
These tumors of the skin
This hostile sun beating down
On the massive mess we're in

[Chorus]
And the gas leaks
And the oil spills
And sex sells everything
Sex kills
Sex kills
Sex kills
Oh, sex kills
Sex kills

 

[Verse 1: Joni Mitchell]
Hard bodies
Soft emotions
So fast
So smart
The world is at your feet
But what about your heart?
Fame and fortune can't hold you tight
In the late late hours of the night

[Chorus: Joni Mitchell and Seal]
How do you stop
How do you stop
Before it's too late?
You choose and you lose
If you hesitate
How do you stop
How do you stop
Before it's too late?
You think love will wait
So you don't hold on
And then it's gone
How do you stop

[Verse 2: Joni Mitchell]
You've had success
Lots of fancy friends
You've tasted the good life
You thought it would never end
One day you're too young
Then you're in your prime
Then you're looking back at the hands of time

[Chorus: Joni Mitchell and Seal]
How do you stop
How do you stop
Before it's too late?
You choose and you lose
If you hesitate
How do you stop
How do you stop
Before it's too late?
Late
You think love will wait
So you don't hold on
And then it's gone
How do you stop

[Bridge: Joni Mitchell and Seal]
How do you stop a runaway train?
How do you stop
How do you stop the driving rain?
How do you stop the ripening corn?
How do you stop
How do you stop a baby being born?

[Chorus: Joni Mitchell and Seal]
How do you stop
Before it's too late?
Too late
You choose and you lose
If you hesitate
How do you stop
How do you stop
Before it's too late?
How do you stop?
How do you stop
You're lost if you hesitate
How do you stop
How do you stop
Love from slipping away?
How do you stop
How do you stop
Before it's too late?
