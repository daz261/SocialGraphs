Having been by that old bank tower
I'm inclined to wonder why you feel so strong
You can't have really seen the hour
If you think she's trying to do you wrong
I see you got that lump in your throat
I hear you mumbling, "That's all she wrote."
Love is in the next room drinking antidote

You ought to know that girl by now
She'll never settle down anyhow
You let your heart go too fast
You let your heart go too fast

Broken glass turns back to flint and sand
I only cease to love as love demands
As you know it takes a while to clap those
Fragments from your idle hands
Couple months could dry a sea of tears
Leave only salt beneath our dried up piers
We won't believe we cared, I swear, in a couple years

You ought to know that girl by now
She'll never settle down anyhow
You let your heart go too fast
You let your heart go too fast

If time heals all wounds, don't you know that
Time also deals them
The days go by, and everybody feels them
We struggle with our fates
But our action only seals them

They say that murder ain't the fault of the weapon
I'm smoking sad to be the gun
I want to blow you all away, but I don't want to put no
Bullets into anyone
I see the feathers that infringe your heart
I see the blood ooze from around the dart
Cupid spites the sense that keeps two
Mismatched souls apart

You ought to know that girl by now
She'll never settle down anyhow
You let your heart go too fast
You let your heart go too fast

You ought to know that girl by now
She'll never turn you down anyhow
You let your heart go too fast
You let your heart go too fast

You let your heart go too fast
You let your heart go too fast
You let your heart go too fast
You let your heart go too fast
