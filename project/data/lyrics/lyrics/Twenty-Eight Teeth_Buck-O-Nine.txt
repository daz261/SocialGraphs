Not long ago there was a time
When everything would blow my mind
Then i'd learn a bit more
Then i'd learn a bit more
It canceled everything
I learned before
I said hey! i don't know what i'm doing
Should i plan on my class reunion?
I've been working on a vision of clarity
This is how it boils down to me

Anything is possible
Anything and everything

When i was nineteen i thought i'd seen
Everything i was gonna see
Then I'd see a bit more
Then I'd see a bit more
It canceled everything i'd seen before
I said hey! i thought i knew it all
I was setting up for one hell of a fall
Writing down my philosophy songs
There one that still holds strong

With everyday that goes by
The less and less i wonder why
Because i've seen them rise
And i've seen them fall
But i'll never claim to have seen them all
I said hey! i ain't seen a thing
You never know what tomorrow will bring
I've been working on a state of mind
Brace yourself for the ride
