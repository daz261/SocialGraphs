I once knew a pair
That used to fit very tight
But now a man's standing tall
In the wake of this night
Na na na na na
His eyes are watering in anger
At the thought of her sight
Na na na na na
The scene of adultery
Sets the stage for his plight

On an innocent trip
How can one ruin so much
A belief in a soul, in a beauty
Or in a touch
Ba ba bada ba
It's like a three-legged dog
In search of a crutch
Ba ba bada ba
Dissecting in past
All the motives of such

She once loved this person in a trial
Out of sight
Disposing of the present situation
It felt right
Ba ba bada ba
Two winters and summers
Passed over like a sound
Ba ba bada ba
And now the two of them are lost
In a screaming battleground

With support all around him
Like a fence or a drink
He realizes in sadness
That now he must begin to think
Ba ba bada ba
To filter his energy
Upon losses and fame
Ba ba bada ba
She'll think of the restful, the peaceful
Or the gain

His sister's a friend
She's like a relative to both
Obliged to her brother
Under silhouetted oath
Ba ba bada ba
But she's there for the two
With her bias undone
Ba ba bada ba
And she'll help see it through
Under moonlight or sun

But today they've still yet
To look each other in the eye
And in a second he manages to dip
To the other side
Ba ba bada ba
Up to the people of the sky
Ba ba bada ba
And now he'll never die
