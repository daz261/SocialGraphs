[Verse 1]
O, so it is written son
When all waters and land you see
All around came to birth
Man and beast was one
And the gods of the sky
Walked the face of the earth

Few free and innocent
Man strolled paths next to those
Of beasts seeing no signs
But stars in the sky
Knowing of day and night
Of rain and winds, hunger and fright
But not of death nor of life

[Interlude]
While all was at ease with all
Living creatures and beast
And the gods of the sky enjoyed the lavish
Riches of this world
Giants rose out of their caves and took to the
Skies challenging the gods for the power of the universe
Only when the great halls of Valhalla
Stood aflame lighting up the worlds all around
Did the gods wake up from their drunken sleep
To speed through the heavens
And clash with the giants in the greatest battle ever seen
Heads arms and legs of both giant and god
Fell down upon the earth
And... The weapons... The swords of shining metal...
And those who found them
And took these shining blades in hand were only men
Now man was the master of this world

[Verse 2]
The story tells of raging winds
Black clouds gathered up high
And of lightning striking
From a burning bloodred sky

The mountains crumbled to the seas
Earth shook the worlds collide
Ending the age of gods
Giving birth to our time

And man lived and man learned
The secret of steel

Ore of earth - fire of sky
Forged is blade of gods

[Bridge]
Blood and iron
Blood and iron
Blood and iron
Blood and iron
Blood and iron
Blood and iron
Blood and iron
Blood and iron

[Verse 3]
So the age to learn and to teach
For man begins, the power to know
The blood and iron discipline
And tell the story of how man was granted
These shining blades of steel

[Verse 4]
Knowing of the past she will know of the tomorrow
And man shall reign, yes even conquer other worlds
And she will set sails on her starships
Sailing across the seas of black space
And become the new gods of the skies
The skies
The skies
The skies
The skies
The skies
The skies
The skies

[Outro]
Blood and iron
