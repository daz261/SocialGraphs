No one knows where
I buried my sweet Virgina Madison
The winter chill falls over me
And keeps me numb inside
Under the moon by the edge of town
She'll quietly wait for me
I promised it wouldn't be too long
Till I returned to sleep with her
She said she don't wanna live no more
Well I don't mind
No I don't mind
So now I'm waitin' for the crack of dawn
To head on back there
To the place where me and her will always be
Now I got my Sunday vest
And I'm headed out that door
Dig my fingers deep in soil just to get to her
All dressed in black and she's so pale
She's waiting there for me
A blanket of soil covers us

To fall asleep in eternity
And now I close my eyes
When I awake with a snap it was all a dream
I gotta empty bottle of something under me
I gotta really bad headache
My clothes are soaking wet
At times like this I wish I hadn't slept
Star locked gaze, uneasy hands
Then the dream fades away
And leaves my head
Another riddle another dream
Another f**ked up fantasy
Gotta learn to stay away from all this tv
She said she would always wait for me
Well i don't mind
No i don't mind
So now i'm headin' to the place where i
Burried my sweet virginia madison

 

This god damn car is broken down again looks like i'm sleepin' in the back and i'll be dreamin' of a better place
Only to call you in the morning with the same excuse again
By the side of the freeway watchin' all the cars go by
I think tomorrow will be the day i get my shit together and give up this crying game
I've been here before i know i'll be here again
I don't know why but it don't feel the same

For one moment i can see clearly
The weight of the world don't seem so bad
Then i find myself here right back where i started from again

Indecisions's no solution the days that lay ahead so i begin to scramble in my head for the answers
Only to find myself shutdown by the same mistakes again
Lookin over my shoulder for the things that pass me by
I know tomorrow will be the same i'll find a new excuse to make the same mistakes again
I've been here before i know i'll be here again
So many wasted hours so many wasted intentions

Chorus

I beat myself got to survive
I've got more will now to stay alive
If i could only find the time
If i could only find a reason
If i could only run this last leg first time around
I wouldn't be stuck in another mess
In another realm with the same old stress

Chorus
