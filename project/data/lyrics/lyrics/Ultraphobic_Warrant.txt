There was sunshine and now there's only rain
And blue skies you turned them into pain
Words were so fine I wanted everyone to know
What other people hold back
I loved the way you showed
I never noticed blood on you before
But everytime you pull another in
I see a little more
You control things
You tell them you're a friend
But if they ever try to get away
You crush them in your hands

CHORUS
Now I see with my own eyes
And not through someone else's lies
Yes, I followed
But with a knife I call the truth
I sever ties and cut me loose
I won't follow

 

Mother should know
Father should go
Battered dreams and broken bones
Living hell when he's at home
Feel so much pain
I'm not to blame
Cannot move cannot breathe
He should die instead of me
Some break away
Some choose to stay
But every scream kept inside
Leaves a scare either way

CHORUS
We are on our own
We all die alone
Black eyed broken truth
I'm still bleeding from a
Wasted Youth

Welcome, to my family picnic
