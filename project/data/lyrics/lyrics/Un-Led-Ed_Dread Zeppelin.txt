[Verse 1]
With a purple umbrella and a fifty cent hat
Living, loving, (living, loving, woman)
Going 'round town in her aged Cadillac
Living, loving, (living, loving, woman)

[Chorus]
I wanna play on the roundabout
Out on the merry-go-round
We all know what your name is
So you better lay your money down

[Verse 2]
Alimony, alimony, paying your bills
Living, loving, (living, loving, woman)
When your conscience hits, you knock it back with pills
Living, loving, (living, loving, woman)

[Chorus]
I wanna play on the roundabout
Out on the merry-go-round
We all know what your name is
So you better lay your money down

[Verse 3]
I haven't told things of how it used to be
Living, loving, (living, loving)
With the butler and the maid and their servants three
Living, loving, (living, loving, woman)

[Solo]

[Verse 4]
Uh, nobody hears a single word you say
Living, loving, (living, loving, woman)
But you keep on talking till your dying day
Living, loving, (living, loving, woman)

[Chorus]
I wanna play on the roundabout
Out on the merry-go-round
We all know what your name is
So you better lay your money down
Lay down, lay down

[Outro]
Living, loving, she's just a woman
Living, loving, she's just a woman
Living, loving, she's just a woman
Living, loving, she's just a woman
Living, loving, she's just a woman
