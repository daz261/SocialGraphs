[Intro]
(One, two, one, two, three four)

[Verse 1]
The lights in the harbour
Don't shine for me
I'm like a lost ship
Adrift on the sea

[Chorus]
The sea of heartbreak
Lost love and loneliness
Memories of your caress
So divine how I wish
You were mine again, my dear
I'm on this sea of tears
Sea of heartbreak

[Verse 2]
Oh, how did I lose you?
Oh, where did I fail?
Why did you leave me?
Always to sail

[Chorus]
This sea of heartbreak
Lost love and loneliness
Memories of your caress
So divine how I wish
You were mine again, my dear
I'm on this sea of tears
Sea of heartbreak

[Verse 3]
Oh, what I'd give just to sail back to shore
Back to your arms once more
Come to my rescue
Oh, come here to me
Take me and keep me
Away from the sea

[Chorus]
Sea of heartbreak
Lost love and loneliness
Memories of your caress
So divine how I wish
You were mine again, my dear
I'm on this sea of tears
Sea of heartbreak

[Outro]
Sea of heartbreak
Sea of heartbreak
Sea of heartbreak

 

[Verse 1]
You wired me awake
And hit me with a hand of broken nails
You tied my lead and pulled my chain
To watch my blood begin to boil

[Chorus]
But I'm gonna break
I'm gonna break my
Gonna break my rusty cage and run
I'm gonna break
I'm gonna break my
Gonna break my rusty cage and run

[Verse 2]
Too cold to start a fire
I'm burning diesel, burning dinosaur bones
I'll take the river down to Stillwater
And ride a pack of dogs

[Chorus]
I'm gonna break
I'm gonna break my
Gonna break my rusty cage and run
I'm gonna break
I'm gonna break my
Gonna break my rusty cage and run

[Verse 3]
When the forest burns along the road
Like God's eyes in my headlights
When the dogs are looking for their bones
And it's raining ice picks on your steel shore

[Chorus]
I'm gonna break
I'm gonna break my
I'm gonna break my rusty cage and run
I'm gonna break
I'm gonna break my
Gonna break my rusty cage and run
I'm gonna break
I'm gonna break my
Gonna break my rusty cage and run
I'm gonna break
I'm gonna break my
Gonna break my rusty cage and run
