Where do you stand when it's all over
Washed from the earth and down to the sea
Do you lie in a bed of roses

Are you still aware
I guess that you don't care about it now

I see your shadow knocking at my door
All plastic face and shaking hands
Now how much space could ever hold you here

Are you still aware
I guess that you don't care about it now

Where do you stand when it's all over
Washed from the earth and down to the sea
Do you lie in a bed of roses

Are you still aware
I guess that you don't care about it now

Are you still aware
I guess that you don't care about it now

 

Tries to preach us in the dark
By the river I hear you talking
Strike a match to Western sky
Blowing fire in the sweet sweet summertime

Alright

Eyes betray what your words don't speak
Burn my gaze with sadness turn your head away
I'd rather be almost anywhere else
A step away from madness

Oh
No man's promised land tell me what you may
Saw the moonlight waiting somewhere further on the way
Wrong turn to Jahannon and I wonder if you'd stay
No man

[?]

Just a preacher in the dark
By the river I hear you talking
Strike a match to the Western skies
Blowing fire in the sweetest summertime

Oh
No man's promised land tell me what you may
Saw the moonlight waiting somewhere further down the way
Wrong turn to Jahannon and I wonder if you'd stay

No man, no man, I wonder if you'll stay
Yeah, I wonder if you'll stay
I wonder if you'll speak
Yeah, wonder if, wonder if, wonder if
Wonder if you'll stay at home

Wonder if, wonder if

 

Deep into my tears
Hold me under drownin' in despair
So many years, only place to hide
Where she could fly never in the sky

And I would not hesitate
To tell the story of her fate
In a storm was she dead or disappeared?
Or did she fly, never said, goodbye, goodbye?

Yep

Leaves have turned to gold
And all the trees have fallen to the ground
I can't explain, all along I knew
That she would fly but I think she's died

Goodbye, yeah, goodbye

 

When you walked into the room
Never seen your face up here
On the ground with all that crawls
To your head before the dawn

Now I'm caught between and tired of all this pain
Holds you under but the shadows still remain

Voices tap you from behind
Did one say that I was wrong
Go ahead and blind yourself
Feeling never will be gone

Now I'm caught between and tired of all this pain
Holds you under but the shadows still remain
Time has taken me down from my pedestal

Then you walked into the room
Never seen your face before
Close my eyes and see the sky
Won't follow you there anymore

Now I'm caught between and tired of all this pain
Holds you under but the shadows still remain
Time has taken me down
It's taken me down, way down there
You know that it's taken me

Oh, I said, "Lord, don't take me"
And now it's taken me down
Down by the ground now
Woah, yeah yeah
