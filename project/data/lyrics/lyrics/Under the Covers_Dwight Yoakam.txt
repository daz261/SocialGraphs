They say you stand by your man
Tell me something I don't understand
You said you love me oh, and that's a fact
And then you left me, said you felt trapped
Well there's some things you can't explain away
And this heartache's with me to this day

Chorus:
Did you stand by me?
No not at all
Did you stand by me?
No way

All the times that we were close
I remember these things the most
I've seen my dreams come tumbling down
I can't be happy without you around
So alone I keep the wolves at bay
And there's only one thing I can say

Chorus:
Did you stand by me?
No not at all
Did you stand by me?
No way

Chorus:
Did you stand by me?
No not at all
Did you stand by me?
No way

--- Instrumental ---

So explain why this must be
Did you lie when you spoke to me? hey

Chorus:
Did you stand by me?
No not at all
Did you stand by me?
No way

I got a job but it don't pay
I need new clothes
Somewhere to stay
Hey, without these things I can do
But without your love
I can't make it through
But if you don't understand
My point of view
Then there's not a damn thing I can do

Chorus:
Did you stand by me?
No not at all
Did you stand by me?
No way

Chorus:
Did you stand by me?
No not at all
Did you stand by me?
No way...
