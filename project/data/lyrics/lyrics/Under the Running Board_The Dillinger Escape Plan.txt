Now who's the fool?

Strip it off, and scale the wall
I am the mask that talks, inside the concrete flesh

I am the king, now tell me nothing
I am the fool for a day
Concrete playground, hides the valley
Make me the king, so I can strip it off

Who is the fool today?
Friend?
A new idea from your stagnant mind
And you must always fall before the clown

I can beat you (I can beat you)
I can cheat you (I can cheat you)
Can I be you?

 

As if in a dream
Only one man
Can know
He tastes the dirt
He chews the dirt
The dirt
The filth
Now swallow
The filth of it
Cold sweat
Runs down slow
Just choke
The filth of it
Now swallow
Mixed with hot tastes of blood
And the cold taste of defeat
I want to die
Just one more time
Roll over and die
White lights mad and MANIACAL
Seep out dark brick walls
You
Just shun heavens thunder
While laughing at the sky
With a hiss of the nightmare's downpour
Laughing at the sky
Now wake up and... DIE
Just one more time
As if in a dream
Only one more time
I must die
