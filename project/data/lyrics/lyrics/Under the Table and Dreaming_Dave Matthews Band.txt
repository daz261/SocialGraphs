[Verse 1]
Up and down the puppies' hair
Fleas and ticks jump everywhere
Cause of original sin
Down the hill fell Jack and Jill
And you came tumbling after
Cause of original sin

[Pre-Chorus]
Rip away the tears
Drink a hope to happy years
And you may find
A lifetime's passed you by

[Chorus]
What would you say?
Don't drop the big one
If you a monkey on a string
Don't cut my lifeline
If you a doggie on a chain
Don't bite the mailman
What would you say?

[Verse 2]
I was there when the bear
Ate his head, thought it was a candy
Everyone goes in the end
Knock, knock on the door
Who's it for? There's nobody in here
Look in the mirror, my friend

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I don't understand at best
I cannot speak for all the rest
In the morning rise a lifetime's passed me by

[Chorus]
What would you say?
(don't drop the big one)
If you a monkey on a string
(Don't cut my life line)
If you a doggie on a chain
(Don't bite the mailman)
What would you say?

[Verse 3]
Every dog has its day, every day has its way
Of being forgotten- "Mom, it's my birthday"
Would you say
What would you say?
What would you say?
"What could you say?"

[Musical Jam]

[Verse 4]
I was there when the bear
Ate his head, thought it was a candy
Everyone goes in the end
Knock, knock on the door
Who's it for? There's nobody in here
Look in the mirror, my friend

[Pre-Chorus 3]
I don't understand at best
Cannot speak for all the rest
Morning rise a lifetime's passed me by
What would you say?

[Chorus]
What would you say?
(don't' drop the big one)
If you a monkey on a string
(Don't cut my life line)
If you a doggie on a chain
(Don't bite the mailman)
What would you say?

 

[Verse 1]
Satellite in my eyes
Like a diamond in the sky
How I wonder
Satellite strung from the moon
And the world your balloon
Peeping Tom for the mother station

[Chorus]
Winter's cold spring erases
And the calm away by the storm is chasen
Everything good needs replacing
Look up, look down, all around, hey satellite

[Verse 2]
Satellite headlines read
Someone's secrets you've seen
Eyes and ears have been
Satellite dish in my yard
Tell me more, tell me more
Who's the king of your satellite castle

[Chorus]
Winter's cold spring erases
And the calm away by the storm is chasen
Everything good needs replacing
Look up, look down, all around, hey satellite

[Refrain]
Rest high above the clouds no restriction
Television we bounce round the world
And while I spend these hours
Five senses reeling
I laugh about the weatherman's satellite eyes

[Verse 1] + [Chorus] + [Refrain]
