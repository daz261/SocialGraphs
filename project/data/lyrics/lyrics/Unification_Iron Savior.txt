Bound to the stars, bound to a land
Unspoiled and virgin
This journey has to end
Out in the cold, lonely we feel
Outcast and homeless
In coffins made of steel

Far beyond - so far beyond a strange horizon
History - the past is lost but we will live on

Still on the quest
Forever we're riding
No place to rest
In deep space we're gliding

Starborn children - their destiny
Starborn out in the cold - their sanctuary
Faster than light we cruise the unknown
Into the dark we've been thrown
Starborn and lost in the cold

Where can we go, where will we find
Shelter and silence
From all we've left behind
So many times we thought we had it all
But we had to follow
The stars and their call

Memories - of all we've left will fade away
Atlantis will - be lost in war and will decay

Goddess of fate
Forever we're riding
Light up the shade
In deep space we're gliding

Starborn children - their destiny
Starborn out in the cold - their sanctuary
Faster than light we cruise the unknown
Into the dark we've been thrown
Starborn and lost in the...

- Solo Piet -

Goddess of fate
Forever we're riding
Light up the shade
In deep space we're gliding

Starborn children - their destiny
Starborn out in the cold - their sanctuary
Faster than light we cruise the unknown
Into the dark we've been thrown
Starborn and lost in the cold

Out in the cold
