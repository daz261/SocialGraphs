Shock to the system
But you're going back inside of the light
Shock to the freedom
Only one more body of love, and they're rolling
They're rolling
They're rolling back
They're rolling back to you!
Rolling after you!

Dreaming all the time
They be dreaming all the time

Shock to the politicians
You know they just got burned by the fire
Shock to the freedom whispers
They're only coming after, they're rolling
They're rolling
They're rolling
They're rolling, coming over!
Coming over!
Coming over!

Dreaming all the time
They be dreaming all the time

So, in answer to the prayer
The one you want is there
The one you feel inside of you
So, in answer to the dream
This time you are so clear
It's always got to be
It's always got to be this way!
Forever...

Shock to the future
Shock to the rights of Mankind
And they won't even go blind
When they can't see what's going on

So, in answer to the prayer
The one you want is there
The one you feel inside of you
So, in answer to the dream
This time you are so clear
It's always got to be

So, in answer to the prayer
The one you feel is there
The one you feel so close to
The order of the Sun
And everyone is one
And all the pieces fit together
Did it all begin with someone?
Did it all begin with someone?
I couldn't have pictured being alive!

Shock to the system
Shock to the system
Shock to the system...

 

(Rabin)
Look around - Got no place to stay
God I hate this town, depending on the day
You look me up, you look me down - Alright, OK
While I got no life, I got no hope;
I'm falling in love
Help me through the fight;
Help me win tonight - I'm calling
What to do I find it hard to know;
The road I walk is not the one I chose
Lift me up and turn me over;
Lead me on into the dawn
Take me to the highest mountain;
Tie me up, love in a storm
Have you decided on my fortune?
Facing the future in your eyes
With your imperial behaviour
We fight amidst the battle cries
Open doors - They may be closed to me;
The fire's still burning in my heart...
What to do I find it hard to know;
I want to turn my life around...
