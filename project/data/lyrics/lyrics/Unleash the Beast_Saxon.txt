Get your kicks in the edge of the sky
Twenty miles up on the borderline
Feel the rush as your body drops through the air
Take a step right into space
Take the blast right in your face
Tumbling down, down towards the ground

Time has come, paid your dues (*)
Take a chance, light the fuse
In thirty seconds time
Your at terminal velocity

Adrenalin rush on a maximum high
Thirty thousand feet to the end of the line
Screaming down towards the world below
Push yourself out dive into air
Take a leap devil may care
Ride the wind across the open sky

(Repeat *)
