Look in your eyes what do I see
The black sheep of the family
And like King Midas in reverse
I've seen you fall from bad to worse

I won't waste my time on someone like you
No more
I can't live my life the way that you do
No more

Well your life is made up of days like these
They end in mediocrity
And I understand so perfectly
'Cause you're the king of misery

I won't waste my time on someone like you
No more
I can't live my life the way that you do
No more

You're the last word in hypocrisy
So let's agree to disagree
And you sing the blues so expertly
'Cause you're the king of misery

I won't waste my time on someone like you
No more
I can't live my life the way that you do
No more

You're the king of misery
You're the king of misery
You're the king of misery
