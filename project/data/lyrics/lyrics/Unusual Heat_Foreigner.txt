[Verse]
This is the thirteenth day of waiting, the second long weekend
These liberties you've taken, have got to end
This distance you've been keeping, grows wider everyday
Time is running out, there's nothing left to say
Innocent child, that's what I once believed
But now I know better, and I am not going to let you play that game with me
I'm telling you mama
I'm going to get lowdown and dirty, run wild in the night
Lowdown and dirty, this time I'll do it right
Loving every minute, making up for lost time
I'll get lowdown, lowdown and dirty
A little time to do something, some searching of the soul
I never knew your heart could be so cold
You're driven by ambition and you want the best that you can get
Ambition leads you blindly if you let it
And I guess you let it

[Pre-Chorus]
That innocent smile, it fooled me all the way
It drew me in, but now there's going to be some hell to pay
Going to be hell to pay

[Chorus]
I'm going to get lowdown and dirty, and break every rule
Lowdown and dirty, nobody going to treat me like a fool
Running free and easy, now I'm out on the loose
I'll get lowdown and dirty, lowdown and dirty tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
Such an innocent child, you fooled me all the way
You drew me in, but now there is going to be some hell to pay

[Chorus]
I'm going to get lowdown and dirty, run wild in the night
Lowdown and dirty, do it good, do it right
You see I've reaching for something that's been
Missing in my life
I've got to get lowdown and dirty, lowdown and dirty tonight
Got to get, got to get, got to get lowdown and dirty
If you could see me right now darling you'd see me flying high
Going crazy
