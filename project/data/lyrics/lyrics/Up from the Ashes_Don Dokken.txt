(White, Norum, Dokken)

Take me back, to a time I remeber well
It's a fact, when your near
You know we could stop the world
If I'm wrong, then alright
You know it doesn't matter now
In my heart, you are mine
You know we're gonna make it somehow
You know we're gonna make it somehow

I can be anything, just for you I can make it right
Fortunes told in love's hearts, it doesn't have
To keep us apart
I'm a soldier of fotune, fighting for a means to an end
If there's love in you eyes, it's only
Gonna take one night
Yeahm, say it's not over and remember

IST CHORUS:
When some night you are lonely
You just call out my name
I will make you mine only
Make you mine only again

On the wings of a tear
You know we could ride the storm
Like desire, I was born
To give you everything and more
If you're a soldier of fortune
Fighting for a means to an end
If there's love in your eyes
It's plainer than the world we share
Yeah, say it's not over and remember

2ND CHORUS:
When some nights you are lonely
You just call out my name
And I'll be there beside you
And I'll Make you mine only

When some night you are lonely
You just call out my name
I will make you mine only
Make you mine only again

Hold on to what you have
And not what you think is yours
Too many people stand there
Blinded by the Light, They don't see

SOLO

Take me back to a time I remeber well
It's a fact, when you're near
You know we could stop the world

2ND CHORUS
When some nights you are lonely
You just call out my name
And I'll be there beside you
And I'll Make you mine only

When some night you are lonely
You just call out my name
I will make you mine only
Make you mine only again
