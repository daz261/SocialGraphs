Television's gone
And I'm alone with Lucifer
What a drag
Muthafucker lied to you
Muthafucker took me head
You're never alone with your Jones
And all you can't forget
So roll on up the price is down
So come on, come on, come on, come on

Today the retard speaks to me
And now I have it all
What a drag
Muthafucker lied to you
It could never get that bad just ask
So go on, go on, go on, go on

I said, who you call retarded now?
Well, I said, who you call retarded now?
I said, who you call retarded now?
I see you standing proud

Come on down and swallow hard
And trust the boy

Who you call retarded now?
I said, who you call retarded now?
I said, who you call retarded now?
I see you standing proud
I see you
I see you standing proud
I see you
And I see you

 

Honey, your junkie ass is frying
Honey, why don't you stop your whining
Your barn door opens and you don't say black
The sidewalk swallows don't you step up on the crack
Honey, I know what worth was waiting for

You got your white coat, mama
You got your heart of soul
I see some crucifixion
Behind those two eyeholes

Gonna take your white trash
Better take your white trash home

I see your hardon for the black girl
Keep your bloody hands off me, and now
Take me to your white trash party
Leave me swinging from a tree

Take out your white trash, take out your white trash, take our your
Take out your white trash, take out your white trash, take our your

 

I smoke a pack a day
I hit the pipe sometimes
And drink my pay
Screw my friends
Understand my need to offend
Come home and smack the woman around
Tried to apologize
But she deserved it, that I know
Strangled with her pantyhose
What's with the flowers
Can't you smell me
I buried you and still you kill me
With all your crying I can tell
That your disease will make me well
Twist your head so I can witness
Come and crawl inside my sickness
And I'm hated
Undisguised
Never known why
And I'm hated

Undisguised
Never known why
Now I like it x4

 

One eye open baby
Both hands tied behind my back
Surprise a comin' in a cross street smile
How so the changes have come slow

Takers drivin' got to take the wheel
We got their lives a hanging and their souls to steal
Give me a break, give me an arm
Wishbone cracky good luck charm, rave on monkey

Come on down little sister
What might be right for goose might not be right for the gander
You got on the Mississippi mudslide
Get up on the tchoupitoulas southpaw

You got to lie now chillun, you got to lie to be willin'
Oh, my soul it's time to awake
Come on down give the kingdom a shake
And, oh, my soul it's time to get down

 

(Paul K.)

Hey man what's that you're thinking?
Maybe you can get away
There must be lots of pressure
And lots of bills to pay

Amphetamines & coffee
It almost makes you gag
Too many big decisions
No more time to play

Slip into something classic
Turn on the television
Ignoring all your children
Accepting their derision

Routine is acknowledged
With pinnacle precision
The statistician stares at
A family in division

Hey!

Amphetamines and coffee!
Amphetamines and coffee!
Amphetamines and coffee!
It almost makes you gag

 

Hey cuz, hey cuz, hey cuz
How you doing, How's it hanging
Don't leave me hanging, I can't be
I'm talking down to you now, and I said
What's wrong, What's wrong, What's wrong
Oh nothing's wrong, My lips are cracked I've been
Smiling all day long
My red eyes are shining
Attention your blinding

[Chorus]
Hey cuz, I'm holding
Who wants to get high
Come to you crawling
Hey cuz can you cry, cry, cry

What's up, what's up, what's up
What's up
Don't be holding out on me
I come to you when you're sleeping tonight
My red eyes are shot

[Chorus]
Hey cuz, I'm holding
Who wants to get high
Come to me crawling
Hey cuz can you cry, cry, cry

When I see your red eyes
I go out of my mind

Not enough x 8

[Chorus]
Hey cuz, I'm calling
Who wants to get high
Come to me holding
Hey cuz can you cry, cry, cry

 

Jane had a bottle of pills
She kept beside her bed
She took a couple when the sky came falling down
"what do you see in me"
She used to say out loud
I see myself in a year
If i'm still around
& i don't feed the doll no no
Jane used to touch herself to make it go away
The loneliness that would follow her all around
& hold her pretty hand
& wanna be her friend
& hold the ceiling when the sky came falling down
I don't really need you
But since you're here
Tell me all about yourself my dear
Are YOU queer?
What happened to your wrists
Do YOU need some help
I can't be checking on YOU like this all the time
YOU want some help then bleed somebody else
YOU know YOU ain't gonna be mine

 

He liked to kiss the boys
He liked to kiss the girls
He liked to kiss the inbetweeners
Rub his tongue on their gums
Rub his tongue on their gums
& lie with them
& lie to them
& light it up
I know your little secret
Watch my eyes
They see what YOU don't see
They see what YOU know
& what YOU think i don't know
Ah but now we both can share
Everything we've ever done
Everyone we've ever touched
YOU liked the boys and girls
I know your little secret
All the lies
All the hesitation
Won't bring me closer now
Won't you bring me close
I know your little secret

 

Stay with me
Why don't you try to be my friend?
Why don't you try a little harder?
Open your arms, open your legs

Won't you try, try to open your mind
Baby, don't you open it up too far
Or your brains will fall out on the sidewalk
That we've walked together

I know what you're thinking about
And I understand, try

Okay now, seems that it's happened again
Don't let it smack you down the hallway
Like your husband did last night
Don't you cry, cry, cry little girl

But baby, let the freezing teardrop fall
Open your eyes and lie awake
Close your eyes and lie awake

Baby, I know what you're thinking about
And I understand
If you try to be your man, if you try

You maybe lost your mind
And you cry, cry
As if your fate were mine

Won't you stay with me?
Will you try to be my friend?
Open your arms, open your legs
Open your mind, open your mind

Baby, I know what you're thinking about
I understand
If you try to be your man
If you try to be your man
