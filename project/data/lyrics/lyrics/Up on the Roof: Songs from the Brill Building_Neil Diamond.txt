When this old world
Starts a getting me down
And people are just too much
For me to face
I'll climb way up to the top of the stairs
And all my cares
Just drift right into space

On the roof, it's peaceful as can be
And there the world below
Don't bother me
Let me tell you now
When I come home
Feeling tired and beat
I'll go up
Where the air is fresh and sweet
I'll get far away
From the hustling crowd
And all that rat-race noise
Down in the street

On the roof
That's the only place I know
Where you just have to wish
To make it so
Let's go up on the roof
Look at those stars darlin'

At night the stars
They put on a show for free
And, darling
You can share it all with me
I keep on telling you
That right smack dab
In the middle of town
I found a paradise that's trouble proof

And if this world
Starts a getting you down
There's room enough for two
Up on the roof
Way up on the roof

 

I took my troubles down to Madame Ruth
You know that gypsy
With the gold cap tooth
She's got a pad down at 34th and Vine
Sellin' little bottles of Love Potion #9

I told her that I was a flop with chicks
I been this way since 1956
She looked at my palm
And she made a magic sign
She said
"Whatcha need is
A bottle of Love Potion #9"
She bent down and turned around
And gave me a wink
She said I'm gonna make it up
Right here in the sink
It smelled like turpentine
And looked like India ink
I held my nose
I closed my eyes
I took a drink

I didn't know if it was day or night
I started kissing everything in sight
But when I kissed a cop
Down at 34th and Vine
He broke my little bottle of
Love Potion #9

She bent down and turned around
And gave me a wink
She said I'm gonna make it up
Right here in the sink
It smelled like turpentine
And looked like India ink
I held my breath and closed my eyes
I took a drink

I didn't know if it was day or night
I started kissin' everything in sight
But when I kissed a cop
Down on 34th and Vine
He broke my little bottle of
Love Potion #9
Love Potion #9
Love Potion #9
Love Potion #9
Love Potion #9
