Get ready - don't stop
Tonight we're goin'
Goin' round the clock
I'm feelin' like a party
That's bout to begin
If I come knockin' on your door
Are you gonna let me in

Save a little for me baby
Shake a little for me baby
Who you gonna love?
I can't help myself
I can't help mysef

I go wild - go wild
I go wild - go wild

Skin tight - cherry red
In between the sheets (Ow!)
As hot as it gets
Like a wild ball of fire
Shootin' out sparks
Come on let's burn it up
Just you and me and the dark

Save a little for me baby
Shake a little for me baby
Who you gonna love?
I can't help myself
I can't help mysef

I go wild - go wild
I go wild - go wild

 

Floatin down the river in this bloodshot city
Back doores open, anything goes. Come on
Drug store beauties always on duty
They get the urge and the urge just never stops, come on

Hey tonight gonna make it something (happen)
Waited so long
Gonna leave it all up to you - all night

Shot sky high, let's go get it
Rockin' in Babylon
Do or die, jump right in it
Lost in Babylon

Shark skin shades a fat cat hustlin
The fish all bite but they don't get nothin - hey hey
Can't sit around just lookin pretty
They'll chop you up in this damn city - move on

Workin it up - shakin it up - bitchin around the city
Stickin around - take the town - gettin down and dirty

 

If I could leave today
You know I'd fly away so high
There was a time I thought
That every battle fought was mine

I used to think I, I could change the world
And never feel the pain
Oh, until I had to face
Arrows and chains
Arrows and chains
Heaven in flames
Arrows and chains

Used to line 'em up shot for shot
When I'd start you know I'd never stop
Be the first to take it
Always used to know where I belong
Always used to come on so strong
Now sometimes I fake it

I used to think I, I could change the world
And never feel the pain
Oh, until I had to face
Arrows and chains
Arrows and chains
Heaven in flames
Arrows and chains

Even an arrow can miss its mark
And every chain can be broken
But if I ain't winnin'
I ain't gonna lay down and die
I used to think I, I could change the world
