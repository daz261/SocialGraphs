[Hook]
This is it, what
Luchini pouring from the sky
Let's get rich, what
The jiggy vines, the sugar dimes
Can't quit, what
Now pop the cork and steam the Vega and get lit
What, what, what

[Verse 1: Geechi Suede]
Introducing phantom of the dark, walk through my heaven
With levitation from reefers, drenching divas in E7
Showboating with Rugers, flash vines, Belafonte vigor
Let's skate for what this worth as we confiscate your figures

[Verse 2: Sonny Cheeba]
Casanova Brown levitating jiggy in dashikis
A la hotta car, fifty-four, chasing diamond runners
Headed ice bound, the big chilla diamond convention
Harlem Buck Strut, freezing world heist, Hollywood
Madame Butterfly, let me in your house of pleasure
From the knuckle Swatch, shadowboxers catching black-eyed blues

[Verse 3: Geechi Suede]
I play the deef, what
Sensations at the Mardi Gras be screaming Chee-ba
Fulfilling pleasures in my castles, blow the smoke out
The Garcia Vega substitutes when the Dutch is gone
The Lo don't stop, give me shouts
It's the seasoned sautéers, souffléers for swerving on corners
We magnets to moolah, living with Charlie's Angels on us
No smiling we're sliding, that gets you caught up in the octa
Or deaded for moving, it's just like that as we proceed

[Verse 4: Sonny Cheeba]
Saturday night special better take it light, you Jah Jah
You're a Capitan, quest to the coast of Key Largo
Wire the chain gang, keep your ears out for Roy Ayers
Sip the Fontainebleau, house of bamboo paradise

[Hook]
This is it, what
Luchini pouring from the sky
Let's get rich, what
The jiggy vines, the sugar dimes
Can't quit, what
Now pop the cork and steam the Vega and get lit what

Luchini pouring from the sky
Let's get rich, what
The jiggy vines and sugar dimes
Can't quit, what
Now pop the cork and steam the Vega and get lit
What, what, what

[Verse 5: Sonny Cheeba]
Fallen pharaohs courtesies of Black Caesar, the convincer
Silky days, satin nights, taking flight, Donald Goines
Sweet sensation Spanish flying with the lady Scarface
Bottoms up sunshine, Love Potion No. 9

[Verse 6: Geechi Suede]
And we hailing from the Magic City
Transcending Suede-a on your aura
Found 'chini in London, relaxation in Bora Bora
Got notion to bring it, sing it, never been my function
Stoning, robbing, we heisting merchandise and gunning
Love it, leave it, but bless the war chief for his bison
Get it, got it, the Lo will forever be nice and

[Verse 7: Sonny Cheeba]
Yeah, the Sonny Cheeba he be sipping Amaret-tah
The Geechi Gracious he be sipping Amaret-tah
We float the tri-state draped in the satin vines
This Coolie High jack-packed from the sugar shack
Then what we do after we sip the Amaret-tah
We start the Harlem River Quiver, dig it sweet daddy
Sharpen the crimson blade, High Sierra serenade
Anatomy for seduction be this ebony junction

[Verse 8: Geechi Suede]
As we exit the place with grace
Drizzy Amaret-tah, the bursting of clouds, it pours
Everything seems better on flats, with love we move
Only in the mist, it's Lo, it's life and we can't get enough of this

[Hook]

[Outro: Sonny Cheeba]
Yeah, the Sonny Cheeba he be sipping Amaret-tah
The Geechy Grace, yes he be sipping Amaret-tah
The Joe Chink he be sipping Amaret-tah
The Chaquita, yeah G be sippin Amaret-tah
We got Asti Spumante with Amaret-tah
And then my man Ill Will sip Amaret-tah
And then my man Cab in the sight sipping that
We slide through the Tri-State with the hi-hat
And then I float side-to-side in my Coolie High
And then I do something with this Spanish Fly, yeah
And then I float down south with the Boogie Flats
And then I slide up in between the ziggy butt-ocks
And all of that yeah

 

[Verse 1: Geechie Suede]
Now who got what you don't got, Lo do, next verse
My alumni comply will shank high, slide, then curve
On some Suede shit, and my ambiance be on some far
Don't you reach kid, you can get vamoose, what's the use?

[Verse 2: Sonny Cheeba]
Well we welling down the whiskey, Cheeba reach the rainbow drive
Towards the Bermuda Triangle with my high
Enter the rocket, foul, friend of the cris-tal
In the Blue Oyster, shooting Zorro to get paid
Fade into the shade, fine moonshine and wine
Now dig what I say 'uh', make me say it one more time
Himalaya playmaker, stashing goods and get the stepping
Seven minutes in heaven, so I gleam the Lena Horne

[Verse 3: Geechie Suede]
The Suede and Cheeba will prevail, sail Indian skies
My display of Belafonte, ice, cheeky, it's fly
Got the ravishing ruger, waiver on deck, my sea port
In the regional hydro-park, post card, and get praised
Hottest M.C.'s, blazing the hemp, limp crystal cool
In another millenium blow the dust off these jewels

[Verse 4: Sonny Cheeba]
Peep the due, laddie, I blow, operation, pacific
If they want it, I kick it all the way to Wakiki
Iron curtain, certain I pull a stocking and skirt-and
Fa-la-la-la, they run, and chill is chiller
Dynamo Duo burnt it, at the Bokeemi heat stroke
Yes Sonny Cheeba with the Satin Struthers make up
Yo G. Suede!

[Hook: Sonny Cheeba]
How we gonna do it? one time y'all
Boogie to the left and to the right y'all
Why? be the jiggy Camp Lo cats
Pouring Balentines in your Valentine, Check it out!

[Verse 5: Sonny Cheeba]
I flame on my shades cause I enter the sunset rays
With the ha-ha, yeah I see you, you see me
Now it's Bye-ya, heat drop from the cah-cah phase
Practice yoga, freezing out, spraying Afro-sheen

[Verse 6: Geechie Suede]
The Lo shit be that jiggy shit, Jah, get your wages up
Lebanon, off the Henny-Dom, higher horizons
Flagrant, silky step toes don't touch the pavement
Just toss Ice and Bricks, skimmer slick, ace, duece, tray shit
My binocular occupy the ocean, off the octagon
The ooohs! and onyx through the opal, Villa Valore
Spilling New Score, the green leaf on it, I pour the meeble
On the fraudulent and galavant, in the Mercury Segal

[Verse 7: Sonny Cheeba]
Call you Sarafina, I throw my thumbalina, up in Dairy Queen 'uh'
Seen her, up in the Beamer with the jiggy fox
Sonny Cheeba, cashmere, no go back to your apple jack
With no finesse in distress
And a full confession, on how you messing, getting funkin' lessons
From the Doctor, Strange love, effervescence
See the star and crescents, when I open up that ass
She's in wonderland, and we do electric bugaloos

[Verse 8: Geechie Suede]
Now we here at the frontier, by Suede, vintage out
Cover my square, re-assemble my crooks for assembly
Make note of my mark, east-trace, slice and brace ox
All flam and flamboyant, meet me crossroads, one way zones
If you with it, I'm with it, blow my smoke, claustrophobic
You can get dealt with, on these flats and you know it
Come on!

[Hook: Sonny Cheeba]
How we gonna do it? one time y'all
Boogie to the left and to the right y'all
Why? be the jiggy Camp Lo cats
Pouring Balentines in your Valentine, Check it out!

[Outro: Sonny Cheeba]
This is how we do, this is how we do
Check it, check it out y'all, this is how we do
This is how we do, this is how we do
Check it, check it out y'all, this is how we do
This is how we do, this is how we do
Check it, check it out y'all, this is how we do
Lo 'uh', Lo 'uh', check it out, check it out, uh!
