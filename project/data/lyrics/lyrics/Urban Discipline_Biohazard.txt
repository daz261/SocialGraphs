[Intro]
Come on God, answer me. For years I'm asking why, why are the innocent dead and the guilty alive? Where is justice? Where is punishment? Or have you already answered, have you already said to the world: here is justice, here is punishment. Here, in me

[Refrain: Evan Seinfeld]
I question not me, it only happens to others
I can't deny reality as life gets smothered

[Verse 1: Evan Seinfeld & Billy Graziadei]
If the lines can be read between
Maybe you can tell me then what it all means
'Cause he who paints the big picture runs the whole scene
Locked down, I gotta get it out
Impending doom, a cloud above my head
Why me? My faith has been devout
Blasphemous? Am I better off dead?

[Hook]
(Punishment, for all my sins)

[Verse 2: Evan Seinfeld & Billy Graziadei]
A burning thought inside my mind
Has me full of pity for all of humankind
As we move forth, we fall further behind
Fear of death, will my life go on?
Controllled fate? On the corner rolling dice
(Punishment), but I've done nothing wrong
In my eyes, who really pays the price

[Chorus]
(My lament, for the human race
Guilty, punishment for all my sins)
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 3: Evan Seinfeld]
Dread the day that brings the truth
Punishment for what I've done
(Sentence me for all my sins)
Bound in fear for what I've got
Though not much, it seems a lot
(Life is death and no one wins)

[Verse 4: Evan Seinfeld]
Bustin' my ass, another day another dollar
As I kneel down and I confess to the father
That I'm suffering a burning question of the truth
Whether or not to pull the trigger or to jump right off the roof
'Cause I did things normal and just like all my friends
But now I'm positive and life - it all ends

[Chorus]
(Punishment, for all my sins, I repent)

[Verse 5: Evan Seinfeld]
In reality, we all must face the fact
That the majority of the people are out there smoking crack
Getting doped up, shooting that shit into their veins
The question must be asked if we have any brains left
Or right or wrong in this song
A question we all ask and must answer before long
'Cause no one is safe in this world, what's the deal?
The sentence is death and to what court do I appeal?

[Chorus]
(Punishment, for all my sins, I repent)
(Punishment)
