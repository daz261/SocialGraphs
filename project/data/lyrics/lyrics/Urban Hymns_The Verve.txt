[Verse 1]
My friend and me
Looking through her red box of memories
Faded I'm sure
But love seems to stick in her veins you know

[Chorus]
Yes, there's love if you want it
Don't sound like no sonnet, my lord
Yes, there's love if you want it
Don't sound like no sonnet, my lord
My lord

[Verse 2]
Why can't you see
That nature has its way of warning me
Eyes open wide
Looking at the heavens with a tear in my eye

[Chorus]
Yes, there's love if you want it
Don't sound like no sonnet, my lord
Yes, there's love if you want it
Don't sound like no sonnet, my lord
My lord

[Verse 3]
Sinking faster than a boat without a hull
My lord
Dreaming about the day when I can see you there
My side
By my side

[Outro]
Here we go again and my head is gone, my lord
I stop to say hello
Cause I think you should know, by now
By now
Oh, by now
By now
By now
By now
Oh, by now
Oh, by now
Oh, by now
Oh, by now
Oh, by now
Oh, by now
Oh, by now
Oh, by now
