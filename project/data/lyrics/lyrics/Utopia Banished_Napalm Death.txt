Prolonged exposure
In a world where I try to belong

I try to belong

Character cessation
On a major scale of depression

Declining sense of fear
A fear that is growing
That some divine treason is making me feel like nothing

Dementia access, dementia access

Wide awake as I await sentence
Resisting to be forced access

Dementia access, dementia access

My immunity lessens every day
I hope salvation relieves my disdain
