[Verse 1]
Consider this a sign
This is a train in the night
And now it's time for you to go
You know you had a healthy life, boy
You walk this world like you're a ghost
Your hands are coming through the needles
Sick of your tragic and the evils
I am the keeper of the songs of everyone

[Chorus]
Look into the sun and see your soul is dying
Used to feel the faith but now you're tired of trying
Should have left alone what you have stolen from everyone
Mmm, how you feeling?
Seems a little sick to me now

[Verse 2]
This is a coming of the times
You are a witness to the movement
If all you're seeing is your lies
You had your chance, but now you've blown it
You want this world so you can own them
I am the keeper of the songs of everyone

[Chorus]
Look into the sun and see your soul is dying
Used to feel the faith but now you're tired of trying
Should have left alone what you have stolen from everyone
Mmm, how you feeling?
Seems a little sick to me

[Bridge]
From the light on high
A chance to change your fate
Forgiveness falling down
On those who chose to wait
Remember the time
Find yourself home again
Deep within your life
Find yourself home again
Find yourself home again
It's a choice
You have chosen your own

It's like I told you
I could turn this into light
If you raise the mask, I can lead us home tonight

[Chorus]
Look into the sun and see your soul is dying
Used to feel the faith but now you're tired of trying
Should have left alone what you have stolen from everyone
How you feeling?

[Outro]
Look into the sun and see your soul is dying
Used to feel the faith but now you're tired of trying
Should have left alone what you have stolen from everyone
Mmm, how you feeling?
Seems a little sick
Seems a little sick
Seems a little sick to me now

 

I once had marigolds for eyes
That seem to fade on sunny days
When it's cold as the rain outside
Well then, so am I

So when it comes down
You'll know I'm with you
And how could I show you?
It feels good to know
It feels good to know you

We once had oceans left to fly
Now the trees and the river
Have parted ways
When it seems like the fun has died
Well then, so have I

So when it comes down
You'll know I'm with you
And how could I show you?
It feels good to know
It feels good to know you

And how will you know?
We storm from a small, thin line
We're torn from the old frames
There's no one here to pull you back again..

So when it comes down, you'll know
Mmmmm, you'll know

Helena? pulled to the ground
(how do I show you?)
Should've known
Soon she would come down
Words were the first thing to go
(it feels good to know)
The lie they would never show

Helena...
(and how will you move?)
Helena...
(and how did I show you?)
Helena...
(I couldn't show you)
Helena...

It feels good to know
It feels good to know you
It feels good to know you
