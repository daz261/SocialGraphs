The parasites will love you when you're dead
Hiding all the rattles in my bed
Come crawling in with bulging eyes
Now I can see there's a bad moon on the rise

Raking all the gravels from the tracks
Forget about the daggers in my backs
Scream across the lawn with fire in her hair
Millionaires come tumbling down the stairs

A big wind spitting female, rain and teeth
The dark wolves fell upon me, wools and fleece
Come crawling in with bulging eyes
Now I can see there's a bad moon on the rise

 

"Ten to one piston
Two-ninety-two to five-o-one camshaft
The heads at two er two fourteen one-eighty-one valves bronze cast
They've been er bow ported
Eight-fifty-double-pumper-holley
Eight-fifty-double-pumper-holley
Eight-fifty-double-pumper-holley
Eight-fifty-double-pumper-holley
And a three-sixty single plane intake"

"What about your bass guitar?"

"Same"
