Aphrodite is rising from the shell
A newly born
To be seen
To expel from the paradise
To drink from her well

Aphrodite is falling into the hell of her sins
And the lust
For that spell
Of the forbidden
Nectar from her well

(O Venus illegitima)
Born again
(O Venus illegitima)
Without shame
(O Venus illegitima)
Child of sin
(O Venus illegitima)
Is my name

El-A'awer. Talbis Iblis
Gulshan-i Raz. Zat-i Shaitan
Ya Zat-i Shaitan

Drink the Wine of Aluqah and breathe the secret smoke of God
Intoxicated by the green shadows of the Paradise
Know that nothing's true and that everything is Permitted
So read the Old Man of the Mountain in his Book of Lies

The Nectar Of Aluqah will run down my dreams
The spring of this paradise hide deep inside unknown unconscious streams
