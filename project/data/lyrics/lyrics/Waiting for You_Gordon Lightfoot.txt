I was at the breakwall, I was lookin' at the sea
In back of the eight ball in some misery
There on the horizon stood a mighty ship of fools
They were headin' into the harbor with all their broken rules
Whenever I'm feelin' lonely I can just pick up the phone
Or I can go to the movies or just stay at home alone
They're better off to be someplace that's a good long way from home
Any way I can lose myself
Dawn is breakin', I'm hesitatin', I'm
Fading away, fading away

They sailed right to meet me, I said what's it all about
Please try to excuse me, we can work things out
If you've ever wondered if that mighty ship is real
Let me tell ya 'bout it brother, it was somethin' you could feel

Whenever I'm feelin' lonely I let twilight set the tone
Or I can go to the movies or just stay at home alone
They're better off to be someplace that's a good long way to roam
Ain't livin' high on the hog right now
Time is wastin', I'm hesitatin', I'm
Fading away, fading away

One more day on the calendar on my mind
I am down around the breakwall puttin' in some time
The whole ship of fools has gotten safely under way
And I was proud to be a part of what it was they had to say

Whenever I'm feelin' lonely I can just pick up the phone
Or I can go to the movies or just stay at home alone
They're better off to be someplace that's a good long piece from home
Any way I can lose myself
Dawn is breakin', I'm hesitatin', I'm
Fading away, fading away
Fading away, fading away
