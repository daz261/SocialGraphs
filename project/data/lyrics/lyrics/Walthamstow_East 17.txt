Gold gold gold gold
Livin' on this planet together
For so long
One step closer clould never
Be wrong
But only for the better and no never
For the worse
Placed here with the Lord's care to
Share this earth
Stop bitin' and fightin'
We're just denyin ourselves
Life and love is one
The deeper you delve
Stop killing and selling
Buying and thinking of gold
Forget the body and remember the soul
Life is worth more than gold
A soul should never be sold
A lie should never be told
'cos life is worth more than gold

Gold we don't need it
Do we
Gold we don't need it
Do we
Gold we don't need it
Do we
Gold we don't need it
Do we
Gold we don't need it
Do we
Gold we don't need it
Gold

More than gold it's plain to see
Jesus weren't sent to set a precious
Stone free
But the heart the part livin'
Inside us all
O spiritual entity the silent call
The flower with a power
To live in two worlds
The innocense asleep inside
The boy and the girl
We have to say it
They must be told
Life is worth much more than gold
Life is worth more than gold
A soul should never be sold
A lie should never be told
'cos life is worth more than gold

Gold we don't need it
Do we ...

I dream I dream I dream I dream
I dream the rain will cease
I dreamt he clouds will pass
I dream the apin will ease
I dream that my dream comes fast
I dream that shadows have light
I dream for peace tonight
And I dream of on end to war
Have you dreamed this dream before
Life is worth more than gold
A soul should never be sold
A lie should never be told
'cos life is worth more than gold

Gold we don't need it
Do we ...

Gold gold gold gold gold

Gold we don't need it
Do we ...
