Well
Second guessin', first impressions
There you go again
You're rushing off in all directions
Since I don't know when
All day long, you've been building walls
You been building walls all day
Putting ceilings on your feelings
When they should be flyin' away

(chorus)
Everything you're lookin' for
You'll know when it's real
You'll know when you find it
By the way, the way
Just the way it makes you feel

Writing down your deepest emotions
With your pen in hand
Your piece of paper flew out the window
You watched it try to land
You felt so bad as it
Flew out of sight
A part of your heart alone in the night
All of a sudden you didn't mind it
When you pictured the lonely stranger
That would finally find it

(chorus) (x2)
