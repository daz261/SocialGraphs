[Verse 1]
It seems you've been kinda down lately
Come here let me talk to you baby
I know it's been driving you crazy
Why did he break your heart
He's gone but your heart is still aching
If it's too soon I really don't mind waiting
Tell me what you think about making
Making a brand new start

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, don't you cry
I'll be right by your side
And I won't say goodbye
Not like the other guys
Heartache is in the past
You saved the best for last
Your love is all I ask
But if I'm moving too fast, girl

[Chorus]
Gimme just a little bit, babe
Just a little bit of your loving
Gimme just a little bit, babe
Just a little bit of your loving
Gimme just a little bit, babe
Just a little bit of your loving
I want all your loving, I must admit
But we can start with just a little bit, babe

[Verse 2]
Just want to let you know that
I want to give you all of my loving
I know it might be kind of sudden
Don't think I'm rushing you
My love for you baby is strong
I haven't felt this way for so long
With me girl you won't go wrong
Because my love is true

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, don't you cry
I'll be right by your side
And I won't say goodbye
Not like the other guys
Heartache is in the past
You saved the best for last
Your love is all I ask
But if I'm moving too fast

[Chorus]
Gimme just a little bit, babe
Just a little bit of your loving
Gimme just a little bit, babe
Just a little bit of your loving
Gimme just a little bit, babe
Just a little bit of your loving
I want all your loving, I must admit
But we can start with just a little bit, babe

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, don't you cry
I'll be right by your side
And I won't say goodbye
Not like the other guys
Heartache is in the past
You saved the best for last
Your love is all I ask
But if I'm moving too fast

[Chorus (until fade)]
Gimme just a little bit, babe
Just a little bit of your loving
Gimme just a little bit, babe
Just a little bit of your loving
Gimme just a little bit, babe
Just a little bit of your loving
I want all your loving, I must admit
But we can start with just a little bit, babe
