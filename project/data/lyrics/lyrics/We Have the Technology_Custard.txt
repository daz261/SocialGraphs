(Waaaaaargh!)

Citrusy and lemony
The lights went out on the border town
And they rock
And they rock

All the bands are making friends with bands
M.o.c.a.t.g
And they rock
And they rock

All their dreams are broken
Their boyfriends are goin' home
From the top of the pops
Oh-woah-woah
AM/FM has gone for another year
