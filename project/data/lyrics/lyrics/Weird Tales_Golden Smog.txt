Looking forward to seeing you
In the sunshine of my time
In a station off the coastline
Coming in view

Looking forward to seeing you
In that one room down the hallway
With two doorways and a window
Without a view

It all comes in threes
I purchase six but I still got three

Looking forward to seeing you
Where the sun shines off the coastline
In a station on your time
Coming in view

Looking forward to seeing you
In that one room down the hallway
With two windows and a doorway
We can't get through

It all comes in threes
I purchase six and I still got three

Looking forward to seeing you
Looking forward to seeing you
Looking forward to seeing you
Looking forward to seeing you

You
You
You
You
You
