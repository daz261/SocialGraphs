[Verse 1]
Don't try to take me away
Like I can't live without you
Today, makin' love tomorrow
Some way, swoopin', you're so fragile
Died today, you disgrace the mortal

[Verse 2]
Fight me lately, tied to someone
We've been laughing since you've been gone
And I want to know
Did you all enjoy the show?
It's so sad to see you go

[Chorus]
And you know
You're my home
You alone
Who's on his own

[Verse 3]
Hanging low today
I replace the highway
Love's the only way
Linking hands the wrong way
So I'd better see you go
It's so sad to see you go
I just thought I'd let you know

[Chorus]
And you know!
You're my home!
Alone!
Who's on his own!
