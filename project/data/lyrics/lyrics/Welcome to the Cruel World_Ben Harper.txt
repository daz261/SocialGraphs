Well you can need me
Well I want you to
And you can feed me
How I like that too
But don't you lead me
I won't follow you
Listen here
I don't fear
I don't want to be your
Whipping Boy

You can tease me
How I want you to
And you can squeeze me
Baby I like that too
I won't follow you
Listen here
I don't fear
I don't want to be your
Whipping Boy

You can hold me
Baby I want you to
And you can scold me
Yes I like that too
I won't follow you
Listen here
I don't fear
I don't want to be your
Whipping Boy

Well I want you to
And you can feed me
How I like that too
But don't you lead me
I won't follow you
Listen here
I don't fear
I don't want to be your
Whipping Boy
