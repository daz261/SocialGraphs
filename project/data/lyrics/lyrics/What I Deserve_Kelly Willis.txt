(Damon Bramblett)

Electricity roared but you looked so bored on the line
Nobody knows how it felt to see that cannonball melt in your mind
Calling all cars, one less dog behind bars, one less man in pain
It hurts to see you go but darling don't you know we're so glad you came

Chorus
And you'll stay gone a long, long time
Day by day you'll fly across our minds
Only a fool would want to stick around
When you're heaven bound

Disconnect the phone, heart from bone, voice from mind
So sad and blue, how'd you do, of course you did just fine
So grab a tail on this big gray whale and do your best to stay brave
In that final hour he was just a beautiful flower that couldn't be saved

Chorus (Twice)
