[Verse 1]
He shouted out his last word
And he stumbled through the yard
And she shattered her last china plate
And spun off in the car

[Verse 2]
When he lunged onto the hood
She stopped to tell him she'd been wrong
He was thrown head over heels
Into the traffic coming on

[Pre-Chorus]
But then all is fair
All is fair in love

[Chorus]
Ba ba ba, ba ba ba, ba ba ba, ba ba ba ba
Ba ba ba, ba ba ba, ba ba ba, ba ba ba ba
Ba ba ba, ba ba ba, ba ba ba, ba ba ba ba
Ba ba ba, ba ba ba, ba ba ba, ba ba ba ba

[Verse 3]
Did you get my other letters
Sometimes I think I oughta call
'Cause you know I often wonder
If you open them at all

[Verse 4]
Every couple nights or so
You know you pop into my dreams
I just can't get rid of you
Like you got rid of me
Oh, but I send my best
'Cause God knows you've seen my worst

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah well, all is fair
All is fair in love

[Chorus]
Ba ba ba, ba ba ba, ba ba ba, ba ba ba ba
Ba ba ba, ba ba ba, ba ba ba, ba ba ba ba
Ba ba ba, ba ba ba, ba ba ba, ba ba ba ba
Ba ba ba, ba ba ba, ba ba ba, ba ba ba ba
Ah, ah, ah

[Bridge]
All this breathing in, never breathing out
All this breathing in, never breathing out
All this breathing in, never breathing out

[Verse 5]
Well, I guess she made her way
Through the mob too late to hear him say
That he'd gotten all he'd wanted
A crowd to watch him bear the pain
He'd been keeping in
(So what) So what

[Pre-Chorus]
All is fair
All is fair in love
Yeah well, all is fair
All is fair in love

[Chorus]
Ba ba ba, ba ba ba, ba ba ba, ba ba ba ba
Ba ba ba, ba ba ba, ba ba ba, ba ba ba ba
Ba ba ba, ba ba ba, ba ba ba, ba ba ba ba
Ba ba ba, ba ba ba, ba ba ba, ba ba ba ba

[Outro]
Am I right?
Am I right?
Not only am I right
I'm lonely and I'm right
Yeah

 

[Verse 1]
6:00am, day after Christmas
I throw some clothes on in the dark
The smell of cold, car seat is freezing
The world is sleeping, I am numb

[Verse 2]
Up the stairs to her apartment
She is balled up on the couch
Her mom and dad went down to Charlotte
They're not home to find us out

[Pre-Chorus]
And we drive
Now that I have found someone
I'm feeling more alone
Than I ever have before

[Chorus]
She's a brick and I'm drowning slowly
Off the coast and I'm headed nowhere
She's a brick and I'm drowning slowly

[Verse 3]
They call her name at 7:30
I pace around the parking lot
Then I walk down to buy her flowers
And sell some gifts that I got

[Pre-Chorus]
Can't you see
It's not me you're dying for?
Now she's feeling more alone
Than she ever has before

[Chorus]
She's a brick and I'm drowning slowly
Off the coast and I'm headed nowhere
She's a brick and I'm drowning slowly

[Bridge]
As weeks went by, it showed that she was not fine
They told me, "Son, it's time to tell the truth"
And she broke down and I broke down
'Cause I was tired of lying

[Verse 4]
Driving back to her apartment
For the moment, we're alone
Yeah, she's alone, and I'm alone
And now I know it

[Chorus]
She's a brick and I'm drowning slowly
Off the coast and I'm headed nowhere
She's a brick and I'm drowning slowly
