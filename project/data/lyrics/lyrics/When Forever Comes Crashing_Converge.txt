Falling head over heels for burden and a bright light
A high cost of playing god I guess
Please, tell me how to survive in this
The unforgiving role of seeing too much

Under the dead wake of morning
Finding solace in a diseased heart
And finding love in acts of desperation
You're no angel my friend, you're no angel

And here we are
Teetering on the edge of tried departure
And there you are with a blessing from below

One drop for every callous ending
And one drop for every ungranted wish
Spare me the day when I discover a new found low
