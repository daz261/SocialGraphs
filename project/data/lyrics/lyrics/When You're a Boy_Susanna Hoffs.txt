Never thought I'd feel this way
You swore your love on all our mothers
But that was only yesterday
Now here's that pain in all those colors

You step right up, you sound so sweet
You make a promise you can't keep

No kind of love
No kind of anything that I really need
I'd give up all my heart
If there was somebody there for me
(Somebody there for me)

I never thought you'd feel this way
To act like I was born to suffer
What was that you tried to say
You take a girl and try to love her

You step right up, you act so clean
I'm just a voice on your machine

No kind of love
No kind of anything that I really need
I'd give up all my heart
If there was somebody there for me
(Somebody there for me)

Sometimes I really need you
(And I find) you've gone and left me far behind
I'm trying to believe you
(Or to leave you) but you never have the time

No kind of love
No kind of anything that I really need
I'd give up all my heart
If there was somebody there for me

I'd give you all my heart
If you was somebody there for me

 

I had a lover, but haven't we all
He had to leave so sometimes I'd call
I was lost and living in the real world
I'd call

Satellites are blinking all through the night
Wishes like this don't seem right
Rising and falling as I make my request
Hello, operator, can I make this collect

Higher and higher, burns the fire
Love's lost on the telephone wire
Too high to reach, too hot to hold
Wishing on telstar, should've been told

Person to person, looking for affection
Do I just break through or do I have to wait
(Person to person) it sure hurts when you get away
My long distance lover, can I make you stay

Higher and higher, burns the fire
Love's lost on the telephone wire
Too high to reach, too hot to hold
Wishing on telstar, should've been told

Hello? Operator?
Hello, hello. Operator?
Hello, hello? Hello, hello?

Wishing on telstar
Should've been, should've been
Wishing on telstar
Should've been told

Higher and higher, burns the fire
Love's lost on the telephone wire
Too high to reach, too hot to hold
Wishing on telstar, should've been told

Wishing on telstar (hello, operator?)
Should've been told (hello, hello, operator?)
Wishing on, wishing on telstar (operator?)
Should've been told
Wishing on telstar

Hello? Operator?
Hello?

 

I wanna fall into you
And I wanna be everything you want me to
But I'm not sure I know how
I lose faith and I lose ground

When I see you I remember, oh
Unconditional love
(Love, love, love)

It doesn't matter what I say
'Cause it always seems you're taking me the wrong way
But if you could read my mind
You'd see, I fight myself all the time

When I see you I surrender, oh
Unconditional love
(Love) love (love) oh-woe (love)
(Love) love (love) oh-oh (love)

Standing on a wilder shore
I got my head up in the clouds
Oh, I ain't got no sense of direction now

I wanna lie next to you
And I wanna do everything you want me to
But I'm not sure I know how
Put your arms around me now

When I feel you I surrender, oh
Unconditional love
(love, love, love)
Oh (love, love, love)

Put your arms around me now
'Cause when I feel you I surrender
Unconditional love
(Love) unconditioned love, hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo (love)

When I see you I remember
Unconditional love
(Love) all you need is (love) what the world needs (love)
Now the word is love (love) love (love) hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo (love)

Ahaa, ahhaaa, haa
