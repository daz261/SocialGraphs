When you shut your eyes and fell asleep
Dark clouds descended on the souls of the ones
Who held you close to their hearts
Close to their hearts

My heart broke
Open

The beauty of an embrace a place
To lay down the pain
Where blood and fire bring rest and peace

I sit away in a secret place the shadow of wings
I think of you
And my heart breaks open
