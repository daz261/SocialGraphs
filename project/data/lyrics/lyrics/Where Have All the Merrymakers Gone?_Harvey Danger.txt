[Verse 1]
All I ever wanted to be
Was a woolly muffler on your naked neck
Double-wrap me when it's cold
But you pulled a little tight just now
And I'm afraid I feel a choke hold c-c-c-coming on
Yeah, I'm afraid I feel a choke hold coming on

[Verse 2]
All I ever thought we might come to was second dates
And flirting eyebrows
Or maybe even psychic friends
And we could share a secret language
And almost definitely make more of it than it was
But everyone around us would know
Everyone watching would know

[Verse 3]
This is not a walk with walking wounded
Here's the ball, here's the pole
Now where's the tether, where's the tether?
Hands can grow together
If you're not careful or grateful or whatever
And I never much cared much too much to begin with

[Verse 4]
I will not take your possibilities under my care
I will not see you on the bus
You want me to hold your hand
It's a courtship I can't stand
And here I thought you were crying
Uh, because you were happy
But no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no

[Verse 5]
Friends will turn against you
People disappoint you every time
So if you've got greatness in you
Would you do us all a favor
And keep it to yourself?
Keep it, keep it to yourself

[Verse 6]
A labored expat fantasy:
Quit your job and move away with me
Oh, what bliss it would be
To pretend we never met

[Outro]
I'm elated now
I'm elated now
I'm elated now
I'm elated now
I'm elated now
I'm elated now
