[Verse 1]
Well if it was just in life
Then we'd know where
We're going to mess things up this time
We're going to make things right today

[Chorus]
I'm not worried about tomorrow (make things right to-day)
I'm just worried about today (yeah, going to make things my way)
I'm not worried about tomorrow (make things right to-day)
I'm just worried about today

[Verse 2]
I see you looking down on me
Yeah, take your stereotypes
Fuck them!
For my dreams
Are designed to make things right

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
I'm not
Worried
Think about the things you said
Think about what they meant

[Chorus]
