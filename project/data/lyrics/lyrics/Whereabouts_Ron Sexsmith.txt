When the world is wearing me down
And the wind is throwing its weight around
So cold, it blows right through me

I need your love
I sure could use your love
Right about now

They say every soul needs searching
But I just don't know where to begin
Give me something to go on

I need your love
I sure could use your love
Right about now

Now that it's late and I see things so clearly
Must be something I can do
I feel like calling but it's much too early for you

So I'm up here writing this song
But tonight the words have come out wrong
Think I'll just let my heart speak

I sure could use your love
Right about now
I need your love
Wish I could feel your love

 

High above it all
These words have lingered on
"I won't let you fall"
Though I must have heard it wrong
'Cause I've been lying here
Seems all these broken songs
Have fallen on deaf ears
I must have heard it wrong

It's time I got used to it
We've all been left behind
But I can't make the pieces fit
Hard as I try
When will I learn?
Believing for so long
As if I had faith to burn
Though I must have heard you wrong

I can't make the pieces fit
Hard as I try
Behind this starry wall
I turned and then walked on
Thought I heard a star fall
Though I must have heard it wrong
