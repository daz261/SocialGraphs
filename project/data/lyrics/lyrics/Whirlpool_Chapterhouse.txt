Sink deeper, autosleeper
Swallow the ache in my skull
Sweet pleasure of never heaven
Soak me in soul-shifting light

Blind angel move through me
Dangerous, vacuous bliss
Move through me

Come closer, autosleeper
Daze all the thoughts from my brain
Slow slumber, pull me under
Bathe me in nothingness truth
