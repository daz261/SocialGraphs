Here you are at the top of the tower
Could a body take that much?
Alone through every waking hour
Asleep without nobody to touch

Whoa whoa whoa and only silence here
Whoa whoa whoa and lonely silence here

And I'm not the one
To make your house a home
Makes no sense to stay
Through one more lonely last day
Oh no babe, it's not right

Here you are cryin' in the night
Could a body take that much?
Find yourself standin' outside
You ain't got nobody to touch

Whoa whoa whoa and there's only silence here
Whoa whoa whoa and there's only silence here

And I'm not the one
To make your house a home
Makes no sense to stay
Through one more lonely last day
Oh no babe, it's not right
