[Intro: Humpty-Hump]
Welcome to the Blue Diamond, y'all
Ladies and gentlemen, I'll be your host
Edward Ellington 'Humpty-Hump' Humphreys III
And we going to get it started up in here..
Billy 'Big Thump' Brown on bass, Thump Brown
Brooklyn, Gibson piano
And on guitar we got Big Mama Dottie Taylor in the house

Com'on mang, drop it like, mang (x4)

[Shock G]
It's been a long time, D.U. shouldn't have left you
Without a heated beat you could step to
Ever since the days when 'the Humpty Dance' left you
Open, I feel you're hopin' that we could pull through
Ninety-five was a long one
They said no one digs your music but you, kid
You need a strong one
But they provoked the wrong one
Because the kids' in rare form tonight
Hey yo we on one!

[Humpty-Hump]
Let me put my nose back on
Notice how it flows when it goes back on
Banging! Freakin' the P-Funk, punk like a bag (?)
I got my man Esenchill E right beside me

[Esenchill]
Yo Hump, look, I brought my rhyme book

[Humpty-Hump]
Cool E, get ready to kick it after the hook
But before you e-mail 'em let me finish nailin'
This groove like a train derailin' (Like a train)
You better hold on, this song is for the strong
Ladies come on and get your flirt on

(Ladies)
When you coming with another one, Humpty?!

[Humpty-Hump]
Everytime you ask that you pump me, love

[Chorus]
Wind me up
Com'on
Wind me up
You wound us up so now we bound to bomb ya
Wind me up
Everybody
Wind me up
You wound us up so now we putting it on ya

[Esenchill]
E, Shock and Hump, we got the bump
You wish for, Hump's back so pump that
It's supposed to lift your
Body up, we got enough
And prob'ly bust the floor up
Shock, you know what?

[Shock G]
What's up, E?

[Esenchill]
I think this track's about to blow up!

[Shock G]
Y'all thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?

[Humpty-Hump]
I'm drinkin' what you drinkin'!

[Esenchill]
So break it up with a crowded thrust (?)
With the bottles up, everybody sink in
To witness the fitness
State to state, don't miss this
Kisses to the misses
Mad pounds to all my bloodhounds
We plug sounds throughout the nation
True power chasin' blue ha hoo-rasin' (?)
DU, and E too, y'all 'bout to shout
We 'bout to place it
High rank, drop stop and bank
This spots about to get hectic, expect it
We got the drank so we got to drank
It won't be neglected, accept it

(chorus)

(Hump, singing)
If it ain't deep it ain't me, bay-bay
Do you take it through a fantasy, bay-bay
The smooth-cool faker is a live wire baby
Sons of the P is packing mad hi-fi figures
And we're in the mood to play (play)
We're going to do away with he-say she-say

[Shock G]
Nas, you can have the world, I want the universe
Not for myself, I put all others first

[Shock G, singing]
It's time, I'm ready to shine, I'm ready to see
If I can walk through my mind, like AMG
I'm drifting on a high, not even lifted yet
On the strength, I feel gifted just because you

(chorus)

[Humpty-Hump]
Puttin' it on ya, boning yo' ear drums, dum-dums
Forgot that we could come-come yum-yum
We bring it different, you bring it humdrum
You're too cool, you can't risk it, I'm bis-quik
I bubble when you turn the heat up
I'm trouble around the honeys cos I eat up
DRAWERS-- tasty, like bean dip
Frisky like catnip, wind me up, FAT HIP!!
The big nose, back with the big bouncy track
We got the bass bouncing back
They got me started, so I'm a bomb it like who farted
Take the red sea and part it, let my dog take a spill on it
Never phoney on it, yeah I still want it
But those shmoes knows how it goes so yo let me flaunt it
I boo-boo on it, take it any way you want it
Glazed-extra-mayonnaise-with-no-bologna on it
Poopty scoops and Humpty clumps of lean cuts
Deez nuts get busted clean, whut
I'ma tell ya what's been missing from the rap game...
THIS TYPE OF SHIT!! SANG!!

(Chorus)
