[Verse 1]
There's a hole in the wall
Where a nail used to be
A nail that held a picture of
The one that once held me
Now that wall's tellin' me
What I don't wanna hear
I'm tired of the word "fool"
Ringin' in my ears

[Chorus]
Oh I guess a saner man
Would simply paint it
But I'm not sane and after all
It's my wall, ain't it
I've got this hammer in my hand
And when I'm through
There'll be a hole in that wall
Big enough to drive a truck through

[Bridge]
When you lose the greatest love
You've ever had
A little hole in the wall
Is enough to drive you mad

[Chorus]
Oh I guess a saner man
Would simply paint it
But I'm not sane and after all
It's my wall, ain't it
I've got this hammer in my hand
And when I'm through
There'll be a hole in that wall
Big enough to drive a truck through

[Outro]
Oh I've got this hammer in my hand
And when I'm through
There'll be a hole in that wall
Big enough to drive a truck through
