I've got a brand new girlfriend
She is so lovely
I've got a new ex-girlfriend
She is so fat and ugly

Oh not you again
It gets worse every time
And one plus two again
Won't work, I can't divide it

Well let it go, I don't care
I love you and you're not there
A brand new song just for you
I'm so sorry but that's not true

I've got a brand new song
It is so happy
I've got a brand new attitude
It is so hateful

You keep telling me that it's so easy to forget it
You keep telling me but I know I'll always regret it

Well let it go, I don't care
I love you and you're not there
A brand new song, I tried my best
I'm so sorry about this mess
