Wild love
Wild love
Somebody chopped down my wild love
Wild love
Wild love
Somebody shot down my wild love

 

Well come on
Sweet smog children, come on
Sweet smog children, come on
But I can't really talk to you
I can only sing
Sweet smog children, I can only sing for you
And I don't want to hear from you
Sweet smog children
It feels like I want to hear from you
But I don't really want to hear from you
Sweet smog children
I just want to touch you
Sweet smog children
Like the invisible man
Sweet smog children, come on
To be untouchable, come on
As only a child can, come on
Sweet smog children
