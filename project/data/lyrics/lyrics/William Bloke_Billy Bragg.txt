Everybody likes you, babe, but me
I guess that proves how stupid I can be
Your father thinks it's swell
Your mum hears wedding bells
Our friends all say we make a lovely couple, we get on so well

People say that we're a perfect match
They don't realise that there's a catch
They don't have to live with you
Forgive you for the things you do
There's just no ignoring, you're pretty but you're boring

Everybody likes you babe, but me
They just don't know how iffy you can be
I'd hate for you to go, before I let you know
That everybody loves you, babe, but me

I'm begging you to stay out of my way
Cos everybody likes you babe, but me
Everybody likes you babe, but me
