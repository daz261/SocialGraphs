[Verse 1]
I don't need to tell the truth
But I never lie
I don't need to bow to you
You're just passing by
I never wanted to be the one you bitch and moan and come home to
But as long as you look good, I come back to you

[Verse 2]
Get inside my troubled mind
With all of your threats
Sometimes I think I was blind
Not before we met
I never wanted to be the one that you depend on for your life
When you cry it smells like soup
Sometimes shown at night, never be my wife

[Chorus]
(Stay out all night)
I've got a right each time I
(Stay out all night)
Know I just might, you make me
(Stay out all night)
It's just the sight of you tonight that makes me
(Stay out all night)
I'm gonna stay out all night

[Verse 3]
You're an evil little girl
I'm a twisted man
Tearing through your perfect world
Make you understand
I never wanted to be the one you bitch and moan and come home to
But as long as you look good, I come back to you
And do the things we do

[Chorus]
(Stay out all night)
I've got a right each time I
(Stay out all night)
Know I just might, you make me
(Stay out all night)
It's just the sight of you tonight that makes me
(Stay out all night)
I'm gonna stay out all night

[Bridge]
I would never treat you bad
You deserve the best from me
If you want to keep your place
You'd better get down on your knees

[Chorus]
(Stay out all night)
I've got a right each time I
(Stay out all night)
Know I just might, you make me
(Stay out all night)
It's just the sight of you tonight that makes me
(Stay out all night)
I'm gonna stay out all night

 

Oh lady, I'd fill a mountain, I'd swim 'cross the ocean, for your love
I said lady, watch closely behind you, I'd search and I'd find you
For your love
Where you gonna go now, I will follow, where you gonna go now
I will follow you
Hey lady, I'd climb through your window
I'd love you and end though, for your love
A guy like me, well I might not thrill you
A guy like me, said I just might kill you
I won't wait around for you love
Where you gonna go now, I will follow
Where you gonna go now, I will follow you
Oh lady, I'd fill a mountain, I'm covered in lotion, for your love
I said lady, I'd swim 'cross the ocean
So lucky and chosen, for your love
Where you gonna go now, I will follow
Where you gonna go now, I will follow you
Where you gonna go now, I will follow
Where you gonna go now, I will follow you
Where you gonna go now, I will follow
Where you gonna go now, I will follow you
