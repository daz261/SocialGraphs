You gave me your dreams
Helped me on the way
I feel your joy, I feel your pain
I feel your joy

I feel your pain
I feel your pain
I feel your pain

I feel your joy. I feel his joy
The loneliest boy

It heals you inside
The need to adore
You feel the dreams
I don't feel any more
I feel your pain
No need to explain

I feel your pain
I feel your joy
I feel your pain
I feel your joy

Your beautiful dreams
Too good to destroy
Too good to destroy
Too good to destroy
Maybe it'll pass
And you'll be here once more
And I'll feel your joy

 

Oh and now the child has grown
Goes in search of something her own
Oh and now it's growing cold
And she's oh so tired of being alone

She tries to find a little space
To hide the things that she can't face . . 

Counting all the people who have lied to her
Now she's growing just a little wiser
See things change and it's growing colder
How she just wishes that you would her

Watch things change, the moments fly away
With all the things she ever meant to say
And all the dreams that they had known

(Background, simultaneously):
(They find their wings, then they let go)
And all the dreams that they had known
(Background, simultaneously:)
(They find their wings, then they let go)
And all the dreams that they had known
