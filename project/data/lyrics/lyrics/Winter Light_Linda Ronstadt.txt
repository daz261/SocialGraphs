Man I can understand how it might be kinda hard to love a girl like me
I don't blame you much for wanting to be free
I just wanted you to know
I love you better than your own kin did from the very start
It's my own fault for what happens to my heart
You see I've always known you'd go

But you just do what you gotta do
My wild sweet love
Though it may mean I'll never kiss your sweet lips again
Pay that no mind
Just find that dappled dream of yours
Come on back and see me when you can

Well I know they make you sad
They make you feel so bad
They say you don't treat me like you should
Folks got ways to make you feel no good
I guess they got no way to know
I've had my eyes wide open from the start
And boy you never lied to me
And the part of you they'll never see
Is the part you've shown to me

So you just do what you gotta do
My wild sweet love
Though it may mean I'll never kiss those sweet lips again
Pay that no mind
Just find that dappled dream of yours
Come on back and see me
Come on back and see me
Come on back see me when you caa.............aaaaan oh oh

Anyone who ever loved could look at me
And know that I love you
Anyone who ever dreamed could look at me
And know I dream of you

Knowing I love you so
Anyone who had a heart
Would take me in his arms and love me too
You couldn't really have a heart and hurt me
Like you hurt me and be so untrue
What am I to do

Every time you go away I always say
This time it's goodbye dear
Loving you the way I do I'd take you back
Without you I'd die dear

Knowing I love you so
Anyone who had a heart
Would take me in his arms and love me too
You couldn't really have a heart and hurt me
Like you hurt me and be so untrue
What am I to do

Knowing I love you so
Anyone who had a heart
Would take me in his arms and love me too
You couldn't really have a heart and hurt me
Like you hurt me and be so untrue
Anyone who had a heart would love me too
Anyone who had a heart would surely take me
In his arms and always love me
Why won't you, yeah
Anyone who had a heart would love me too
Anyone who had a heart would surely take me
In his arms and always love me
Why won't you
Yeah
Anyone who had a heart would love me too
