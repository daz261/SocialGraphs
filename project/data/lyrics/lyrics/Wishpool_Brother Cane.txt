(Johnson, Frederiksen, Sims)
Spinning mirror ball, hanging over me
Spinning mirror ball, are you listening
Don't justify or hesitate, feel the sorrow when you wait
Close your eyes and don't ask why, you will need no aliby
Lucky mirror ball, hanging over me
Come and see me now
Come and show me, show me how
I'm waiting, been standing on the line
Just waiting, I'm crossing over this time
Don't save me, looks like I'm finally out of my mind
Lucky mirror ball, never lie to me
Is it real at all, immortality?
Not satisfied in between, living here with all these things
I can see the other side, do I dare to take that ride
Hold me now, and I will wait
Dreams can lie, and drift away
Spinning mirror ball, are you listening
Spinning mirror ball, never lie to me
