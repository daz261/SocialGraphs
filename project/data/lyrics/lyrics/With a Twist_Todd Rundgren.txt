[Verse 1]
I can feel, I can tell
I can feel, I can tell, I can see
Something is changing
To me change is no stranger

I don't run, I don't hide
I don't run, I don't hide, I don't fight
What fate arranges
I don't think about danger

[Pre-Chorus 1]
If it was meant for me
I'd know just when to go
But if I can take it slow
Then I might be in control

[Verse 2]
In the back of my head
In the back of my head there is doubt
There is suspicion
With my new fascination

I don't know what it is
I don't know what it is
You might say it's intuition
It's a true indication

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I should trust myself
I should beware of this
But it's like a stranger's kiss
And somehow I can't resist

[Chorus]
I can feel, I can feel my will slip away
From a strange influenza
I can feel, I can feel my mind slip away
Under your influenza
I can feel, I can feel my heart slip away
Under your influenza

[Verse 3]
There's a part of my heart
There's a part of my heart that cries out
Please go no further
I just can't take the pressure

So I try to resist
So I try to resist and my heart
Tells me don't bother
That this pain is a pleasure

[Pre-Chorus 3]
If I were someone else
I wouldn't disagree
But it's always hard to see
When something's controlling me

[Chorus]
I can feel, I can feel my will slip away
From a strange influenza
I can feel, I can feel my mind slip away
Under your influenza
I can feel, I can feel my heart slip away
Under your influenza

[Outro]
I can feel, I can feel my will slip away
Under your influenza
I can feel, I can feel my mind slip away
Under your influenza
I can feel, I can feel my heart slip away
Under your influenza...

 

[Verse 1]
We can't play this game anymore
But can we still be friends?
Things just can't go on like before
But can we still be friends?

[Chorus 1]
We had something to learn
Now it's time for the wheel to turn
Grains of sand, one by one
Before you know it, all gone

[Verse 2]
Let's admit we made a mistake
But can we still be friends?
Heartbreak's never easy to take
But can we still be friends?

[Chorus 2]
It's a strange, sad affair
Sometimes seems like we just don't care
Don't waste time feeling hurt
We've been through hell together

[Bridge]
(La la la - la la la - la la la)
(La la la - la la la - la la la)
(La la la - la la la - la la)
(La la la - la la la - la la la)
(La la la - la la la - la la la)
(La la la - la la la - la la)

[Verse 3]
(La la lala la la lala la
Can we still be friends?)
Can we still get together sometime
(La la lala la la lala la
Can we still be friends?)
You know life will still go on and on and on

[Chorus 3 - Outro]
We awoke from our dream
Things are not always what they seem
Memories linger on
It's like a sweet, sad old song

(La la la - la la la - la la la)
(La la la - la la la - la la la)
(La la la - la la la - la la la)
(La la la - la la la - la la)

(La la la - la la la - la la la)
(La la la - la la la - la la la)
(La la la - la la la - la la la)
