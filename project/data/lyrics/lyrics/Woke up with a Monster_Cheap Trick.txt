Hush little darling, don't you cry
Daddy's coming home, coming home tonight
No bed of roses for your head, for you
You see no future, it's all in the past
This is a nightmare, won't be your last
It's hard to admit, it's hard to admit you're that blind

Mommy and Daddy don't see eye to eye
Mommy and Daddy don't see when we cry
Mommy and Daddy they don't understand
What's wrong with this picture, is right in their hands

Sleeping with an angel. Ah
Woke up with a monster. Ah
Sleeping with an angel. Ah
Woke up with a monster. Ah

Hush little darling, don't be long
Momma's little angel can't do nothing wrong
No bed of roses in your head, for you
Who'll dry your tear when you cry?
Daddy's comin' home just in time
Will, he be the one to make it, to help make it right?

Mommy and Daddy don't see eye to eye
Mommy and Daddy make each other cry

Sleeping with an angel. Ah
Woke up with a monster. Ah
Sleeping with an angel. Ah
Woke up with a monster. Ah

Not sleeping with an angel. Ah
Not sleeping with an angel. Ah
Mommy and Daddy don't see eye to eye
Mommy and Daddy don't hear when we cry

Mommy and Daddy don't see eye to eye
Mommy and Daddy don't see when we cry
Mommy and Daddy they don't understand
What's wrong with this picture, is right in their hands

Sleeping with an angel. Ah
Woke up with a monster. Ah

Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, ow
