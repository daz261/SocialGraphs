Sometimes you lose
Sometimes you lose
On impact points, always the follow through
Sometimes Friday, and it's sometimes good
Better get back home open up the book
Sometimes you-lose, sometimes you-lose
On impact points, there is always that follow through
Sometimes Friday, and its sometimes good
Well a Hong Kong book of kung fu and a Hong Kong book of kung fu
Get winter wear in the summer
Your summer in the winter
Alright!

A reputation city wide
Defensive lobe
Never loose that final ping-pong
Sometimes it comes to you, sometimes good
Well a Hong Kong book of kung fu and a Hong Kong book of kung fu
Get winter wear in the summer
Your summer in the winter
Alright!

Embarrassment keeps people
In-their place
Most of the time
But not always
So sometimes Friday, sometimes it's good
Hong Kong book of kung fu and a Hong Kong book of kung fu
Get winter wear in the summer
Your summer in the winter
Alright!
Sometimes you-loose
Sometimes you-loose
On impact points, always follow through
Sometimes Friday, and it's sometimes good (hot dog)
Well a Hong Kong book of kung fu and a Hong Kong book of kung fu
Get winter wear in the summer
Your summer in the winter
Alright!
