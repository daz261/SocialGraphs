[Verse 1]
I get camping eyes in the final hour
Last minute shoppers picking cauliflower
The fuss they make, you'd swear they were buying a car
They always moan, moan it's not so cheap
Cheaper still, cheaper still down the street
Lose my rag and tell them take your bag and shop down there
Closing down, they're closing down another road
One way, system steals the show
Mack the knife swigs a can and sings the day away

[Chorus]
There's more life, more life, more life in a tramp's vest
There's more life, more life, more life in a tramp's vest

[Verse 2]
The flower man sits down in the street
Surrounded by, the stock he bought last week
Bring back the ladies wearing lipstick on their teeth
Make up, we make up a crappy joke
Sit back, relax and have a smoke
Mack the knife swigs a can and sings the day away

[Chorus]
There's more life, more life, more life in a tramp's vest
There's more life, more life, more life in a tramp's vest
There's more life, more life, more life in a tramp's vest
There's more life, more life, more life in a tramp's vest

[Verse 3]
I get camping eyes in the final hour
Last minute shoppers picking cauliflower
Mack the knife swigs a can and sings the day away

[Chorus]
There's more life, more life, more life in a tramp's vest
There's more life, more life, more life in a tramp's vest
There's more life, more life, more life in a tramp's vest
There's more life, more life, more life in a tramp's vest
