[Intro]
Depending on how you see a thing
Depending on how you see a thing

[Verse 1]
Depending on how you see a thing
The ship is free, or is it sinking?
Depending on how you see it
You cage your mind, or you free it
Depending on how you see the times
The world divides or it closely binds

[Chorus]
But I just wanna hear a good beat
I jus wanna I jus wanna
But I just wanna hear a good beat
I jus wanna hear a good beat
Oooahh

[Verse 2]
Depending on you see a thing
The ship is free, or is it sinking?
Depending on how you see it
The song is over or you keep it
Depending on how you see the times
We're wasting time or in a moving line

[Chorus]
But I just wanna hear a good beat
Oh oh oh a
I jus wanna hear a good beat
Just piano and bass

[Outro]
Everything will be alright
When you feel it tonight
Zu zu zu wah zu wah
I just wanna hear a good beat

 

[Intro]
I believe in the power of love (I believe)
I believe in the power of love (I believe)
I believe in the power of love
I believe in the power of love
Feel the power
Let the people call me naive
I believe
I believe
I believe
I believe
Hey
(I believe)

[Verse 1]
What is it that can make a lost soul found?
Love
And what is it that can make the coldest day seem warm?
Love
And what is it that can bring a smile through to strangers?
Love
Love
Love
Love

[Chorus]
I believe in the power of love (I believe)
I believe in the power of love (I believe)
I believe in the power of love
Let them call me na√Øve
But I still believe

[Instrumental break]

[Bridge]
Power of love
Power of love
Power of love
Power of love

[Verse 2]
What is it that can make a lost soul found?
Love
And what is it that can make the coldest day seem warm?
Love
And what is it that can bring a smile through to strangers?
Give it everything
'Cause what you give you get
So give it everything
Open your heart

[Chorus]
I believe
I believe
I believe
I believe
Hey
Love
Love
Love
Love
I belive
I belive
I belive
I belive
Hey

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
(I believe)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
(I believe)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
(I believe)

 

You don't have to say no words
And it comes in every language
You can see it in every nation
It helps communication

It's like a shining sun
Up high in the sky
And when you blink your eyes
It's like a nice surprise

Take your time
As long as you make the time
To be happy

Smile on, pass it on
Smile on, pass it on

Do do dodoo
Do do do do dodoo
You got to keep moving
Keep movin keep movin

It's a universal sign
Everyone can do it
You can change people's minds
If you choose to use it

Smile on, pass it on
Smile on, pass it on
