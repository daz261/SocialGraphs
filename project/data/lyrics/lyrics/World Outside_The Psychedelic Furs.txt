I come pulling all the stops
Putting rain on all of this
With the sirens in my sleep
And her sorrow at my kiss
I can't turn away
Hold a hand to when you pray
All her vanity and fate
Written on her crazy face
Here in my head
I hear you say
Here in my head
I hear you pray
Time is what it's made
Made by others i regret
Remember me i hear it said
Out of faces i forget
Hope you get up off your feet
Shake the dust out of your shoes
City lights and all my jazz
All my demonstrations too
Here in my head
I hear you say
Here in my head
I hear you pray
Time is what it's made
Made by others i regret
Remember me i hear it said
Out of faces i forget
Here in my head
I hear you say
Here in my head
I hear you pray
Here in my head
I hear you say
Here in my head
I hear you pray
