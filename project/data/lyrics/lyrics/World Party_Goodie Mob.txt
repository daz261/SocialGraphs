Put up your lighter (x4)

Hook

Party, all night, fiesta, forever(x4)

(Big Gipp)
This be a party, for the whole world
Travel cross seas like that girl
We in the mind altering thangs
Couldn't leave it alone, we offered it a loan
Watch the porch jump straight to the ceiling
Hear the party drums beat for beat
So, some want us to leave, but they want more, the time came to sang
Peace, they brought the rain, to wash away the pain
So we all can party in the streets

(Cee-Lo)
Well, I don't know about you
But we all trying to play dumb
But don't you worry about me
I promise you we gonna get free
Just party

Hook

(Khujo)
See your eyes be burgundy, and your body drop
Don't even look at your clock, ?skeet on your vest?
Or get up and watch the hands fly, in the middle of December
I wash the wife-beaters, heaters on full blast
With some ?? we like scavengers circling your block
While you do that your ?paper drop?
You better hop jump and skip, before we dip
Because we falling through you, like the Bloods and Crips
Gotta close your eyes and start dreaming
Everybody life got a little meaning
Got to spread your wings and start flying
If you living don't be worrying bout' dying
Just party

Hook

(Cee-Lo)
Whether fast or slow, face it, pace it and let yourself go
Might not get a chance to do it no mo'
Let the music take your mind, leave the worries of the world behind
Oh, such a beatiful sight for the blind
It remind me of a celebration
One nation under one rule
Its that you ain't got nothing to prove
Ohh, let the music move you, and sooth you, like its supposed to

Love is life, life is worth loving
Love is life, life is worth living (x2)

Hook

(T-Mo)
T-Mo cuts the record down to the bone
And now we back rapping on the microphone
I say signing autographs for little kids delight me
We can't help but be some stars in the shining night
See I was raised in the SWATS by my mom and pop
To be a cold little brother that you can't stop
On top of the charts, I'm a ladies man
The type of brother with heart, weak suckers can't stand
Cause I wanna be free, hear my spirit it's the clearest
Can you hear it in the gospel
I came down here cause I gotta believe
Don't follow me, I say I need someone to take me to the Rave

Hook

 

[Gipp]
Yup, yup, yeah.. uhh..
Yeah..

All night like a corner store, twenty-four seven
Hood hanger; we gets hot like a wok
In the Chinese kitchen, switchin up on my shoe wear
How we get down, we blew down, nigga big bank style
Sit and chill a while, wait a minute yo we blows big nigga
Sip on bottles with funny names, holla holla
Deep in this thang, keep it simple and plain
And watch my chain hang, watch my chain hang

[Cee-Lo]
Listen here -- I got a book that you should read
It's about me, and I suggest that to any nigga who doubt me
It will correct you, affect you, it will make shit clear
Now switch to the next nigga with that bullshit here
Keep readin -- it will also say
That if you, disrespect, anything up in this way
That will guaran-tay an awesome array of gunplay, okay?
This is Carlito's Way, all day

[T-Mo]
Shake it shake it shake it shake it hang out all night
And don't stop until the DJ quit spinnin what's right
Everybody sweatin gettin closer and closer, be shoulder to shoulder
Bouncin, bouncin, we tipsy, danceflo' is slippery
But we groovin, keepin this bitch movin
Provin, we bang in this game watch my chain hang

[Khujo]
Back and forth, back, and forth
?? style, whatchu know bout ridin out
From the Kroger parking lot to the Paramount
And Birmingham then back, punk is spittin his jack
When the leaves turn ur-ange, and you see your breath
Uhh, fifteen eleven colossal
I'm weighing in at a Knighton
If you don't know nuthin else
Believe that it is some ol' real niggas

Chorus: Cee-Lo (repeat 2X)

Whether you slang 'caine, or you gang-bang
Or work a nine to five, just tryin to maintain, mayne
Do your thang, mayne, it's all the same, mayne
And let your chain swang, and let your chain hang

[T-Mo]
Lyric assassin while mashin they blastin come fast and
Scatter from every rational imaginal
International region, under my seeds and, over these airwaves
Manipulate the rhyme with my mind so it's good to grind
Through your speaker, this one's a keeper
Like Ebenezer, it was his decision, to live his life
Through a tunnel vision, followed by the reaper
Who knows your past deeper, don't let him creep ya, from behind

[Khujo]
Before I was rudely interrupted, house fallin down
But we straight, you should save yourself ??
It's rainin suckers cause they greed sickens me
Poverty stricken, hand pickin, in the corner cleansin
Lights out poor, slip and you nails hell
Everythang for sale, be eat with they plastic
Let's enhance it, I'll be good til Saturday
Thick volume gravity

[Gipp]
We bout to mix and mingle, meet a match for the next single
Money stashed away in jars like Pringles
Keep it hard for the Tunnel, we make it bump
For the 5 5 nina skull-cap boot-wearin renegade motherfuckers
Throw yo' hands up, you give it up we give it back
Yo, this is how we act when it's packed from the back
Lady don't snatch, let my chain hang
Everythang is everythang boo

[Cee-Lo]
Behold, the stolen soul, the ancient scroll
The game of control, roll the Swisher swoll
Open the gate away, lay to lay, I getcha gotcha greaterly
Even when you hate me, you educate me
So try to trill, I will take ya to the battlefield
Crack your motherfuckin, windshield you better yield
Cause I got the right of way, night or day, alright okay
This is Carlito's Way

Chorus 2X
