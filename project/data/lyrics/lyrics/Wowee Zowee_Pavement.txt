[Verse 1]
Oh, that I could bend my tongue outwards
Leave your lungs hurting, tucking my shirt in
Pants I wear so well, cross your t's shirt smell
Worse than your lyin', caught my dad cryin'
Loose like the wind
From the rough we get par
Sleet city woman waiting to spar

[Chorus]
I'm drowning for your thirst
Drowning for your thirst
Drowning for your thirst
Drowning for your thirst

[Verse 2]
Getting off on the candelabra
We call her Barbara, breeding like larva
She rabble rousing, dental surf combat
Get out those hard-hats
And sing us some skat
Blade gushers gush
Chained and perfumed
I don't need a minister to call me a groom

[Chorus]
But I'm rattled by the rush
Rattled by the rush
Rattled by the rush
Rattled by the rush

[Break]
No soap in the john
No soap in the john
No soap in the john
No soap in the john

[Chorus]
Rattled by the rush
Rattled by the rush
Rattled by the rush
Rattled by the rush (makes you wanna say your prayers)

Rattled by the rush
Rattled by the rush
Rattled by the rush
Rattled by the rush (makes you wanna say your prayers)

Rattled by the rush
Rattled by the rush
Rattled by the rush
Rattled by the rush (makes you wanna say your prayers)

Rattled by the rush
Rattled by the rush
Rattled by the rush
Rattled by the rush (makes you wanna say your prayers)

 

[Verse 1]
Sunday drive past your own hall of fame
It's closed on weekdays, shut for good
They got no one when you're talking
Thoughts like rattlesnakes were walking
No one has a clue

[Chorus]
The parting shots
The thin caught fault line dancing across the frigid air shacks
The spastic rats, the criminals chat

[Verse 2]
Count to ten and read until the lights begin to bleed
Lights! Until you actually see the rays
And your thoughts they start to turn in
Just lessons that you're learning
No one has a clue

[Chorus]
The gauzy thoughts of the sturdy Scots
Wrestle with the elements up on the trail high
I need to know, where does it go?
How do I get there and what will I find?

[Outro]
Fun, fun, fun, fun for the summertime blues
(It's gonna set you free)
Fun, fun, fun, fun, for the summertime blues
