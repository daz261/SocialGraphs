[Verse 1]
I remember holding on to you
All them long and lonely nights I put you through
Somewhere in there, I'm sure I made you cry
But I can't remember if we said goodbye

[Chorus]
But I recall all of them nights down in Mexico
One place I may never go in my life again
Was I just off somewhere or just too high?
But I can't remember if we said goodbye

[Verse 2]
I only miss you every now and then
Like the soft breeze blowing up from the Caribbean
Most Novembers I break down and cry
'Cause I can't remember if we said goodbye

[Chorus]
But I recall all of them nights down in Mexico
One place I may never go in my life again
Was I just off somewhere or just too high?
But I can't remember if we said goodbye

[Outro]
No I can't remember if we said goodbye
Goodbye goodbye
