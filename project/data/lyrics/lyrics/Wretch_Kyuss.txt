[Verse 1]
Do I look blind?
Or deaf?
Or dumb to you?
Do you see burning pictures on my face?
It didn't take long
To figure out what's wrong with you
Fuck off, well I'll put you in your place

[Chorus]
Could it be
That love has passed me by?
And could it be
You're just a thorn in my side?
And all I see
Is that you're walking away from me?
And all I know
Is that you'll never change me

[Verse 2]
This hate in me
Well it's burning in my veins
I'm gonna' take it out on you
Well and make you feel my pain yeah
Cold caresses
Well as you walk away
Baby, things aren't
Supposed to be that way, no no

[Chorus]
Could it be
That love has passed me by?
And could it be
You're just a thorn in my side?
And all I see
Is you're walking away from me?
And all I know
That you'll never...

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 1]
Do I look blind?
Or deaf?
Or dumb to you?
Do you see burning pictures on my face?
It didn't take long
To figure out, what's wrong with you
Fuck off, well I'll put you in your place yeah

 

[Chorus]
Goddamn son of a bitch
Goddamn son of a bitch
Goddamn son of a bitch
Goddamn son of a bitch
Goddamn son of a bitch

[Verse 1]
Goddamn son of a bitch
See the young ones play
And say what you want to hear
You have long legs, long hair
Big tits, you got a big ass
Your parts will never last, never last

[Chorus]
Goddamn son of a bitch
Goddamn son of a bitch
Goddamn son of a bitch
Goddamn son of a bitch

[Verse 2]
Goddamn son of a bitch
See the young ones say, well and play
What they want to hear, from you
You say you're not fucking with them
You say they're not fucking with you
Compete with them and you'll never win, never win

[Chorus]
Goddamn son of a bitch
Goddamn son of a bitch
Goddamn son of a bitch
Goddamn son of a bitch

[Verse 3]
Well it's cold where we come from
But not to make me freeze
I look around me but I see
The world different than before
There's been a change in me
Things are looking pretty blurry
I keep a wishing she would awake me
And tell me it was just a bad dream
But I guess you can't be awakened
When you're already awake, it's a reality, yeah

[Chorus]
Goddamn son of a bitch
Goddamn son of a bitch
Goddamn son of a bitch
Goddamn son of a bitch
