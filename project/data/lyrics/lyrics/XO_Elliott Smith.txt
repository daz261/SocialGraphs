[Verse 1]
Everybody knows which way you go, straight to over
No one wants to see you inside of me, straight to over
I heard the hammer at the lock
Say you're deaf and dumb and done
Give yourself another talk
This time make it sound like someone

[Chorus]
The noise is coming out, and if it's not out now
Then tomorrow, tomorrow
They took your life apart and called your failures art
They were wrong though, they won't know, 'til tomorrow

[Verse 2]
I got static in my head
The reflected sound of everything
Tried to go to where it led
But it didn't lead to anything
The noise is coming out, and if it's not out now
I know it's just about to drown tomorrow out
