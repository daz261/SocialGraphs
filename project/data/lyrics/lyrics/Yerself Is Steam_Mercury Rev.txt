No, I won't chicken out
Hey, wait, babe
Wait up now
Hey babe, wait up now

If we could find a space
Where we could both stretch out
Roll like Coney Island cyclones
No, I won't chicken out
No, I won't chicken out

No doubt babe
No doubt now
No doubt babe
No doubt now

I spend all day
On your mom's couch
Spend all night
And I won't chicken out
No, I won't chicken out

Let's go out tonight
Find a sunny space
Picking up the Skylab
Throw it back in space

No, I won't chicken out (I'm not messing with you)
No, I won't chicken out (I'm not messing with you)
No, I won't chicken out (I'm not messing with you)
No, I won't chicken out (I'm not messing with you)
