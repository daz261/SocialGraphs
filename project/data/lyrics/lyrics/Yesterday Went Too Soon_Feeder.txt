Reading magazines and counting sheep to pass the time away
Hoping that tomorrow's gonna bring a smile back home again
Images of palm trees sway in the wind on south beach
Takes me back to better days, summer rays, the Everglades in June

My brain, my poor brain
My brain, my poor brain

Drinking myself to sleep again
Night nurse pills to keep me sane
Drinking myself to sleep again
Insomnia

Flying high in golden skies, I'm flicking channels in my mind
Finding my utopia a different chapter in a book
Thinking back to younger days as I escape in coopers break
Takes me back to '84, the future's knocking at my door

My brain, my poor brain
My brain, my poor brain

My brain, my poor brain
My brain, my poor brain

Drinking myself to sleep again
Night nurse pills to keep me sane
Drinking myself to sleep again
Insomnia

I'm drinking myself to sleep again
Night nurse pills to keep me sane
Drinking myself to sleep again
Insomnia

Turning off the switch inside me
Leaving all the stress behind me
Flying over streets and houses
Passing over the wye valley
Takes me back to '84
The future's knocking at my door

My brain, my poor brain

Drinking myself to sleep again
Night nurse pills to keep me sane
Drinking myself to sleep again
Insomnia

I'm drinking myself to sleep again
Night nurse pills to keep me sane
Drinking myself to sleep again
Insomnia

I'm drinking myself to sleep again
Night nurse pills to keep me sane
Drinking myself to sleep again
Insomnia
