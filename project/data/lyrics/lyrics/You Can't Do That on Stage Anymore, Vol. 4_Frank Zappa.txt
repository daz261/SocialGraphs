This is a song about the union, friends
How they fucked you over and the way they bends
The rules to suit a special few
And you gets pooched every time the do

You know we gotta stick together
You know we gotta stick together
You know we gotta stick together
You know we gotta stick together

Once upon a time the idea was good
If only they'd a done what they said they would
It ain't no better, they's makin' it worse
The labor movement's got the Mafia curse

You know we gotta stick together
You know we gotta stick together
You know we gotta stick together
You know we gotta stick together

Don't be no fool, don't be no dope
Common sense is your only hope
When the union tells you it's time to strike
Tell the motherfucker to take a hike

You know we gotta stick together
You know we gotta stick together
You know we gotta stick together
You know we gotta stick together

(repeats)

 

You know, your mama and your daddy
Saying I'm no good for you
They call me dirty from the alley
Till I don't know what to do

I get so tired of sneakin' around
Just to get to your back door
I crawled past the garbage and your mama jumped out
Screamin' "Don't come back no more."
I can't take it

My guitar wants to kill your mama
My guitar wants to kill your mama
My guitar wants to burn your dad
I get real mean when he makes me mad

Later I tried to call you
Your mama told me you weren't there
She told me don't bother to call again
Unless I cut off all my hair

I get so tired of sneakin' around
Just to get to your back door
I crawled past the garbage and your mama jumped out
Screamin' "Don't come back no more."

Later I tried to call you
Your mama told me you weren't there
She told me don't bother to call again
Unless I cut off all my hair

I get so tired of sneakin' around
Just to get to your back door
I crawled past the garbage and your mama jumped out
Screamin' "Don't come back no more."

My guitar wants to kill your mama
My guitar wants to kill your mama
My guitar wants to burn your dad
I get real mean when he makes me mad
