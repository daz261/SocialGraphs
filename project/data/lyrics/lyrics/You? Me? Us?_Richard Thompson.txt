She's telling me she don't need headlights
She's telling me the storm is friendly
She says the volts are inviting
She talks in couplets, she steers by lightning

She takes a knife to my seatbelt
She says the brakes need mending
She says my mood needs heightening
She talks in couplets, she steers by lightning

Two angels sitting in the back seat
They're pointing at their watches
I feel eternity biting
She talks in couplets, she steers by lightning

My Maggie, she's got a loose one
She uses Milton as a road map
My Maggie, she is a bright thing
She talks in couplets, she steers by lightning
