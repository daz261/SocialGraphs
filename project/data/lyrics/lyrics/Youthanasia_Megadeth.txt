[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
I'm doing you a favor
As I'm taking all your money
I guess I should feel sorry
But I don't even trust me
There's bad news creeping up
And you feel a sudden chill
"How do you do? My name is Trouble."
I'm coming in for the kill

[Pre-Chorus 1]
In for the kill
Ooh, and you know I will

[Chorus]
Set the ball a-rolling
I'll be clicking off the miles
On the train of consequences
My boxcar life of style
My thinking is derailed
I'm tied up to the tracks
The train of consequences
There ain't no turning back, oh

[Verse 2]
No horse ever ran as fast
As the money that you bet
I'm blowing on my cards
And I play them to my chest
Life's fabric is corrupt
Shot through with corroded thread
As for me, I hocked my brains
Packed my bags and headed west

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I hocked my brains
Headed west

[Chorus]
Oh, set the ball a-rolling
I'll be clicking off the miles
On the train of consequences
My boxcar life of style
My thinking is derailed
I'm tied up to the tracks
The train of consequences
There ain't no turning back

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Oh, set the ball a-rolling
I'll be clicking off the miles
On the train of consequences
My boxcar life of style
My thinking is derailed
I'm tied up to the tracks
The train of consequences
There ain't no turning back

[Chorus]
Set the ball a-rolling
I'll be clicking off the miles
On the train of consequences
My boxcar life of style
My thinking is derailed
I'm tied up to the tracks
The train of consequences
There ain't no turning back

[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
Only yesterday they told me you were gone
All these normal people, will I find another one?
Monkey on my back, aching in my bones
I forgot you said "One day you'll walk alone."
I said I need you, does that make me wrong?
Am I a weak man, are you feeling strong?
My heart was blackened, it's bloody red
A hole in my heart, a hole in my head

[Pre-Chorus]
Who will help me up?
Where's the helping hand?
Will you turn on me?
Is this my final stand?

[Chorus]
In a dream I cannot see
Tangled abstract fallacy
Random turmoil builds in me
I'm addicted, addicted to chaos

[Verse 2]
Lights shined on my path, turn bad days into good
Turn breakdowns into blocks, smashed 'cause I could
My brain was laboured, my head would spin
Don't let me down, don't give up, don't give in
The rain comes down, cold wind blows
The plans we made are back up on the road
Turn up my collar, welcome the unknown
Remember that you said "One day you'll walk alone."

[Pre-Chorus]
Who will help me up?
Where's the helping hand?
Will you turn on me?
Is this my final stand?
Oh...

[Chorus]
In a dream I cannot see
Tangled abstract fallacy
Random turmoil builds in me
I'm addicted to chaos

[Instrumental Break]

[Pre-Chorus]
Who will help me up?
Where's the helping hand?
Will you turn on me?
Is this my final stand?
Stand...

[Chorus]
In a dream I cannot see (in a dream I cannot see)
Tangled abstract fallacy (tangled abstract fallacy)
Random turmoil builds in me (random turmoil builds in me)
Builds, it builds, it builds
In a dream I cannot see (in a dream I cannot see)
Tangled abstract fallacy (tangled abstract fallacy)
Random turmoil builds in me (random turmoil builds in me)
I'm addicted to the, I'm addicted, addicted to chaos

[Outro]
Addicted
Addicted to chaos, chaos
Addicted to chaos
Chaos, chaos
