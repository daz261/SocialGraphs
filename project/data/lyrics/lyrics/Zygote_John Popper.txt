And what about the times
Now I'm grabbing out at breaking glass
An attempt to find a memory
That makes it seem glorious or at least okay

But all I have is me
In a razor caught off guard as you brush by
The alarm wakes me out of bed
And the dream I was just having simply fades away

And blindly do I see
At the sunlight I am freezing
And as I start to come around, I want to fall back to the ground
Roll over and make sense again

But it's too late I am awake
And it's sensation, I can't fake as I try my best to pretend
But once you wake up
You just can't fall back asleep anymore

I know it isn't fair
But once you're aware
You can back track all you want
You can mourn for what's gone
But you're up either way
You better deal with your day

I remember I was tired
In fact I still have some sleep in my eyes
So I got all warm and safe and numb
Figured I'd lie down and rest a while

Next thing came the morning
And you're shaking me and telling me to rise
And I would tell you anything
To stall and make you think or smile or cry

You see all I need is you
And then I start to understand what love does
Now there's so much that I can give
And I finally want to live

You know before I just didn't really ever care
And I'll do more than hold on
I want to celebrate the dawn
I don't ever want to go back to sleep I swear
But once you wake up
You can't just fall back to sleep anymore

I know it isn't fair
But once you're aware
You can backtrack all you want
You can mourn for what's gone
But you're up either way
You better deal with your day
