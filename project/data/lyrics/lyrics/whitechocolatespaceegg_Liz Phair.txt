What a pretty life you have
Oh boy, it's a pretty life you have
And I would need a map
Just so I could navigate the backyard
Home is very ordinary
I know I was born to lead a double life
Of murder, strife, and misery

And when I find it
I know I'll make sense of me

I wanna be
Cool, tall, vulnerable, and luscious
I would have it all
If I'd only had this much
No need for Lucifer to fall
If he'd learn to keep his mouth shut
I wanna be involved, be involved
Be involved, be involved
I wanna be involved with you

I know the girls that
Live inside your world
Just sitting next to a
Mortal makes their skin crawl

I wanna be
Cool, tall, vulnerable, and luscious
I would have it all if
I'd only had this much
No need for Lucifer to fall
If he'd learn to keep his mouth shut
I wanna be involved with you

Wanna be
Cool, tall, vulnerable, and luscious
I would have it all
If I'd only had this much
No need for Lucifer to fall
If he'd learn to keep his mouth shut
Be involved, be involved
Be involved, be involved
I wanna be involved with you
Oh, with you
