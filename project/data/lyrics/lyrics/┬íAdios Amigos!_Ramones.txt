[Verse 1]
Everybody said so man you could see it on T.V
They stood there ashamed with nowhere to go
Nobody wants them now the kids are alright
Every day is a holiday and pushing people around

[Chorus]
I'm making monsters for my friends
I'm making monsters for my friends

[Verse 2]
Someone caught one I could see so myself
I had to call 254 so they wouldn't blame me
We wanted to know how much trouble there was
When we asked our daddy he said it's just because

[Chorus]
I'm making monsters for my friends
I'm making monsters for my friends

[Verse 3]
I don't wanna open a can of worms and
I don't want any Spagetti-Os
And I could always tell when
Someone is holding a grudge

[Chorus]
I'm making monsters for my friends
I'm making monsters for my friends
I'm making monsters for my friends
I'm making monsters for my friends
