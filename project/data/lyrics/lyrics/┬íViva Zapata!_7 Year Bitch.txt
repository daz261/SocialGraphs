He said I did something really stupid today
He said I did something really stupid today
Well can I bounce, bounce a rock off your head?
Can I pronounce, pronounce you dead?
Can I bounce, bounce that rock off your head?

So you're kickin' back into a once kicked habit
Outta boredom
'Cuz you were sharing
Kickin' back in and kickin' back
Just sharin'

When you start lying to yourself
Then don't come running back to me
I still remember the pathetic mess you used to be

Watched you bang, bang, bang your head against the
Bang, bang, bang your head against the wall
Watched you bang, bang

We're all so smart and we're all so dense
We need a little more mind over matter
To get to what matters
'Cuz we know what's the matter

'Cuz you're hip like junk
Flash so bad
Oh wouldn't it be nice
To get what you had
Make it last, better and longer
Make it last, last a little longer

You'll be hip like junk
Flash so bad
Oh I'm alone
With you so lonely
'Cuz you're hip and you're bad
Yeah I can see you itchin', the corner's your mouth were twichin'
You're so hip and you're bad
And I think you've been had
Oh wouldn't it be nice
Yeah wouldn't it be nice

To watch you bang, bang, bangin' your head against the
Bang, bang, bangin' your head against the wall
Watch you bang, bang
Watch you bang, bang
